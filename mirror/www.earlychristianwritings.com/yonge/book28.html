 THE SPECIAL LAWS, II*
<p>
   {**Yonge's title, A Treatise on the Special Laws, Which Are Referred to Three Articles of the Decalogue, Namely the
  Third, Fourth, and Fifth; About Oaths, and the Reverence Due to Them; About the Holy Sabbath; About the Honour To Be
<p>                                Paid to Parents.}
<p>
   I. (1) In the treatise preceding this one we have discussed with accuracy two articles of the ten
 commandments, that which relates to not thinking that any other beings are absolute gods, except
 God himself; and the other which enjoins us not to worship as God any object made with hands.
 And we also spoke of the laws which relate specially to each of these points. But we will now
 proceed to discuss the three which come next in the regular order, again adapting suitable special
 laws to each. (2) And the first of these other commandments is not to take the name of God in
 vain; for the word of the virtuous man, says the law, shall be his oath, firm, unchangeable, which
 cannot lie, founded steadfastly on truth. And even if particular necessities shall compel him to
 swear, then he should make the witness to his oath the health or happy old age of his father or
 mother, if they are alive; or their memory, if they are dead. And, indeed, a man's parents are the
 copies and imitations of divine power, since they have brought people who had no existence into
 existence. (3) One person is recorded in the law, one of the patriarchs of the race, and one of
 those most especially admired for his wisdom, "as swearing by the face of his father," for the
 benefit, I imagine, of all those who might live afterwards, and with the object of giving necessary
 instruction, so that posterity might honour their parents in the proper manner, loving them as
 benefactors and respecting them as rulers appointed by nature, and might therefore not rashly
 invoke the name of God. (4) And these men also deserve to be praised who, when they are
 compelled to swear, by their slowness, and delay, and evasion, cause fear not only to those who
 see them, but to those also who invite them to take an oath; for when they do pronounce the oath
 they are accustomed to say only thus much, "By the--;" or, "No, by the--;" without any further
 addition, giving an emphasis to these words by the mutilation of the usual form, but without uttering
 the express oath. (5) However, if a man must swear and is so inclined, let him add, if he pleases,
 not indeed the highest name of all, and the most important cause of all things, but the earth, the
 sun, the stars, the heaven, the universal world; for these things are all most worthy of being named,
 and are more ancient than our own birth, and, moreover, they never grow old, lasting for ever and
 ever, in accordance with the will of their Creator.
<p>
 II. (6) And some men display such easiness and indifference on the subject, that, passing over all
 created things, they dare in their ordinary conversation to rise up to the Creator and Father of the
 universe, without stopping to consider the place in which they are, whether it be profane or sacred;
 or the time, whether it be suitable; or themselves, whether they are pure in body and soul; or the
 business, whether it be important; or the occasion, whether it is necessary; but (as the proverb
 says), they pollute everything with unwashed feet, as if it were decent, since nature has bestowed
 a tongue upon them, for them to let it loose unrestrained and unbridled to approach objects which it
 is impious to approach. (7) When they ought rather to employ that most excellent of all the organs
 by which voice and speech (the most useful things in human life, and the causes of all communion
 among men) are made distinct and articulate, in a manner to contribute to the honour, and dignity,
 and blessing of the great Cause of all things. (8) But now, out of their excessive impiety, they use
 the most awful names in speaking of the most unimportant matters, and heaping one appellation
 upon another in a perfect crowd they feel no shame, thinking that by the frequency and number of
 their uninterrupted oaths they will attain to the object which they desire, being very foolish to think
 so; for a great number of oaths is no proof of credibility, but rather of a man's not deserving to be
 believed in the opinion of men of sense and wisdom.
<p>
 III. (9) But if any one being compelled to swear, swears by anything whatever in a manner which the
 law does not forbid, let him exert himself with all his strength and by every means in his power to
 give effect to his oath, interposing no hindrance to prevent the accomplishment of the matter thus
 ratified, especially if neither implacable anger or frenzied love, or unrestrained appetites agitate the
 mind, so that it does not know what is said or done, but if the oath has been taken with sober
 reason and deliberate purpose. (10) For what is better than to speak with perfect truth throughout
 one's whole life, and to prove this by the evidence of God himself? For an oath is nothing else but
 the testimony of God invoked in a matter which is a subject of doubt, and to invoke God to witness
 a statement which is not true is the most impious of all things. (11) For a man who does this, is all
 but saying in plain words (even though he hold his peace), "I am using thee as a veil for my iniquity;
 do thou co-operate with me, who am ashamed to appear openly to be behaving unjustly. For though
 I am doing wrong, I am anxious not to be accounted wicked, but thou canst be indifferent to thy
 reputation with the multitude, having no regard to being well spoken of." But to say or imagine such
 things as these is most impious, for not only would God, who is free from all participation in
 wickedness, but even any father or any stranger, provided he were not utterly devoid of all virtue,
 would be indignant if he were addressed in such a way as this. (12) A man, therefore, as I have
 said, must be sure and give effect to all oaths which are taken for honourable and desirable
 objects, for the due establishment of private or public objects of importance, under the guidance of
 wisdom, and justice, and holiness.
<p>
 IV. And in this description of oaths those most lawful vows are included which are offered up in
 consequence of an abundance of blessings, either present or expected; but if any vows are made
 for contrary objects, it is not holy to ratify them, (13) for there are some men who swear, if chance
 so prompts them, to commit theft, or sacrilege, or adultery, or rape, or to inflict wounds or
 slaughter, or any similar acts of wickedness, and who perform them without any delay, making an
 excuse that they must keep their oaths, as if it were not better and more acceptable to God to do
 no iniquity, than to perform such a vow and oath as that. The national laws and ancient ordinances
 of every people are established for the sake of justice and of every virtue, and what else are laws
 and ordinances but the sacred words of nature having an authority and power in themselves, so
 that they differ in no respect from oaths? (14) And let every man who commits wicked actions
 because he is so bound by an oath, beware that he is not keeping his oath, but that he is rather
 violating one which is worthy of great care and attention to preserve it, which sets a seal as it were
 to what is honourable and just, for he is adding wickedness to wickedness, adding lawless actions
 to oaths taken on improper occasions, which had better have been buried in silence. (15) Let such
 a man, therefore, abstain from committing iniquity, and seek to propitiate God, that he may grant to
 him the mercy of that humane power which is innate in him, so as to pardon him for the oaths which
 he took in his folly. For it is incurable madness and insanity to take upon himself twofold evils, when
 he might put off one half of the burden of them. (16) But there are some men who, out of the
 excess of their wicked hatred of their species, being naturally unsociable and inhuman, or else
 being constrained by anger as by a hard mistress, think to confirm the savageness of their natural
 disposition by an oath, swearing that they will not admit this man or that man to sit at the same table
 with them, or to come under the same roof; or, again, that they will not give any assistance to such
 an one, or that they will not receive any from him as long as he lives. And sometimes even after the
 death of their enemy, they keep up their irreconcileable enmity, not allowing their friends to give the
 customary honours even to their dead bodies when in the grave. (17) I would recommend to such
 men, as to those I have mentioned before, to seek to propitiate the mercy of God by prayers and
 sacrifices, that so they may find some cure for the diseases of their souls which no man is
 competent to heal.
<p>
 V. (18) But there are other persons, also, boastful, puffed up with pride and arrogance, who, being
 insatiably greedy of glory, are determined to obey none of the precepts which point to that most
 beneficial virtue, frugality; but even if any one exhorts them to it, in order to induce them to shake
 off the obstinate impetuosity of the appetites, they look upon all their admonitions as insults, and
 drive their course on headlong to every kind of effeminate luxury, despising those who seek to
 correct them, and making a joke of and turning into ridicule all the honourable and advantageous
 recommendations of wisdom. (19) And if such men happen to be in such circumstances as to have
 any abundance and superfluity of the means of living, they declare with positive oaths that they will
 indulge in all imaginable expense for the use and enjoyment of costly luxury. For instance, a man
 who has lately come into the enjoyment of considerable riches, embraces a prodigal and
 extravagant course of life; and when some old man, some relation perhaps, or some friend of his
 father, comes and admonishes him, exhorting him to alter his ways and to come over to a more
 honourable and strict behaviour, he is indignant beyond all measure at the advice, and being
 obstinate in his contentious disposition, swears that as long as he has the means and resources
 necessary for supplying his wants he will not practise any single way which leads to economy or
 moderation, neither in the city nor in the country, neither when travelling by sea nor by land, but that
 he will at all times and in all places show how rich and liberal he is; but as it seems to me such
 conduct as this is not so much a display of riches as of insolence and intemperance. (20) And yet
 many men who have before now been placed in situations of great authority, and even many who
 now are so, though they have most abundant resources of all kinds, and enormous riches, wealth
 continually and uninterruptedly flowing upon them as if from some unceasing spring, do
 nevertheless at times turn to the same things which we poor men use, to earthenware cups, and
 small cheap loaves, and olives, or cheese, or vegetables, for a seasoning to their dinners; and in
 the summer put on a girdle and a linen garment, and in winter any whole and stout cloak, and for
 sleep use a bed made on the ground, discarding gladly couches made of ivory or wrought in
 tortoiseshell and gold, and coverlets of various embroidery, and rich clothes and purple dyes, and
 the luxury of sweet and elaborate confectionery, and costly viands; (21) and the reason of this
 conduct is not merely that they have a virtuous and abstemious disposition by nature, but also that
 they have enjoyed a good education from their earliest youth, which has taught them to honour
 what belongs to man rather than what belongs to authority, which also taking up its settled abode in
 the soul, I may almost say reminds it every day of its humanity, drawing it down from lofty and
 arrogant thoughts, and reducing it within due bounds, and correcting whatever is unequal by the
 introduction of equality. (22) Therefore such men fill their cities with vigour and abundance, and
 with good laws and peace, depriving them of no good thing whatever, but providing them with all
 requisite blessings in the most unlimited and unsparing manner; for this conduct and actions of this
 sort are the achievements of men of real nobility, and of men who may truly be called governors.
 (23) But the actions of men newly become rich, of men who by some blunder of fortune have
 arrived at great wealth, who have no notion, not even in their dreams, of wealth which is genuine
 and truly endowed with sight, which consists of the perfect virtues, and of actions in accordance
 with such virtues, but who stumble against that wealth which is blind, leaning upon which, and
 therefore of necessity missing the right road, they turn into one which is no road at all, admiring
 objects which deserve no honour at all, and ridiculing things that are honourable by nature; men
 whom the word of God reproves and reproaches in no moderate degree for introducing oaths on
 unfitting occasions; for such men are difficult to purify and difficult to cure, so as not to be thought
 deserving pardon even by God, who is all-merciful by nature.
<p>
 VI. (24) But the law takes away from virgins and from married women the power of making vows
 independently, pronouncing the parents of the one class, and the husbands of the other, their lords;
 and with reference to any confirmation or disavowal of their oaths, declaring that that power
 belongs in the one case to the father, and in the other to the husband. And very reasonably, for the
 one class by reason of their youth are not aware of the importance of oaths, so that they stand in
 need of the advice of others to judge for them; while the other class do often out of easiness of
 disposition take oaths which are not for the interest of their husbands, on which account the law
 invests the husbands and fathers with authority either to ratify their oaths or to declare them void.
 (25) And let not widows swear inconsiderately, for they have no one who can beg them off from the
 effect of their oaths; neither husbands, from whom they are now separated, nor fathers, whose
 houses they have quitted when they departed from home on the occasion of their marriage, since
 it is unavoidable that their oaths must stand as being confirmed through the absence of any one to
 take care of the interests of the swearers. (26) But if any one knows that any one else is violating
 his oath, and does not inform against him, or convict him, being influenced by friendship, or
 respect, or fear, rather than by piety, he shall be liable to the same punishment as the perjured
 person; {1}{#le 5:21.} for assenting to one who does wrong differs in no respect from doing
 wrong one's self. (27) And punishment is inflicted on perjured persons in some cases by God and
 in others by men; but those punishments which proceed from God are the most fearful and the
 most severe, for God shows no mercy to men who commit such impiety as that, but allows them to
 remain for ever unpurified, and in my opinion with great justice and propriety, for the man who
 despises such important matters cannot complain if he is despised in his turn, receiving a fate
 equal to his actions. (28) But the punishments which are inflicted by men are of various characters,
 being death, or scourging; {2}{#de 19:16.} those men who are more excellent and more strict in
 their piety inflicting death on such offenders, but those who are of milder dispositions scourging
 them with rods publicly in the sight of all men; and to men who are not of abject and slavish
 dispositions scourging is a punishment not inferior in terror to death.
<p>
 VII. (29) These then are the ordinances contained in the express language of these
 commandments; but there is also an allegorical meaning concealed beneath, which we must
 extract by a careful consideration of the figurative expressions used. We must be aware,
 therefore, that the correct principles of nature recognise the power both of the father and of the
 husband as equal, but still in different respects. The power of the husband exists because of his
 sowing the seed of the virtues in the soul, as in a fertile field; that of the father arises from its being
 his natural office to implant good counsels in the minds of his children, and to stimulate them to
 honourable and virtuous actions; and because, when he has done so, he cherishes them with
 salutary doctrines, which education and wisdom supply; (30) and the mind is compared at one time
 to a virgin, and at another to a woman who is a widow, and again to one who is still united to a
 husband. It is compared to a virgin, when it preserves itself pure, and undefiled, free from the
 influence of pleasures and appetites, and likewise of pains and fears, treacherous passions, and
 then the father who begot it retains the regulation of it; and her principle, as in the case of a
 virtuous woman, she now being united to pure reason, in accordance with virtue, will exert a proper
 care to defend her, implanting in her, like a husband, the most excellent conceptions. (31) But the
 soul which is deprived of the wisdom and guardianship of a parent, and of the union of right reason,
 being widowed of her most excellent defences, and abandoned by wisdom, if it has chosen a life
 open to reproach, must be bound by its own conduct, not having reason in accordance with wisdom
 to act as intercessor, to relieve her of the consequences of her sins, neither has a husband living
 with her, nor as a father who has begotten her.
<p>
 VIII. (32) But in the case of those persons who have vowed not merely their own property or some
 part of it, but also their own selves, the law has affixed a price to their vows, not having a regard to
 their beauty, or their importance, or to any thing of that kind, but with reference to the number of the
 individuals separating the men from the women, and the infants from those who are full grown. (33)
 For the law Ordains{3}{#le 27:3.} that from twenty years of age to sixty the price of a man shall be
 two hundred drachmas of solid silver money, and of a woman a hundred and twenty drachmas. And
 from five years of age to twenty, the price of a male child is eighty, and of a female child forty
 drachmas. And from infancy to five years old, the price of a male is twenty; of a female child,
 twelve Drachmas.{4}{#le 10:3.} And in the case of men who have lived beyond sixty years of age,
 the ransom of the old men is sixty, and of the old women forty drachmas. (34) And the law has
 regulated this ransom with reference to the same age both in men and women on account of three
 most important considerations. First of all, because the importance of their vow is equal and
 similar, whether it be made by a person of great or of little importance. Secondly, because it is
 fitting that those who have made a vow should not be exposed to the treatment of slaves; for they
 are valued at a high or at a low price, according to the good condition and beauty of their bodies, or
 the contrary. Thirdly, which, indeed, is the most important consideration of all, because inequality is
 valued among men, but equality is honoured by God.
<p>
 IX. (35) These are the ordinances established in respect of men, but about animals the following
 commands are given. If any one shall set apart any beast; if it be a clean beast of any one of the
 three classes which are appropriate to sacrifice, such as an ox, or a sheep, or a goat, he shall
 surely sacrifice it, not substituting either a worse animal for a better, or a better for a worse. For
 God does not take delight in the fleshiness of fatness of animals, but in the blameless disposition
 of the man who has vowed it. But if he should make a substitution, then he must sacrifice two
 instead of one; both the one which he had originally vowed, and the one which he wished to
 substitute for it. (36) But if any one vows one of the unclean animals, let him bring it to the most
 venerable of the priests; and let him value it, not exaggerating its price, but adding to its exact value
 one-fifth, in order that if it should be necessary to sacrifice an animal that is clean instead of it, the
 sacrifice may not fall short of its proper value. And this is ordained also for the sake of causing the
 man who has vowed it to feel grieved at having made an inconsiderate vow, having vowed an
 animal which is not clean, looking upon it, in my opinion, for the moment as clean, being led away
 by error of mind through some passion. (37) And if the thing which he has vowed be his house,
 again he must have the priest for a valuer. But those who may chance to buy it shall not pay an
 equal ransom for it; but if the man who has vowed it chooses to ransom it, he shall pay its price and
 a fifth besides, punishing his own rashness and impetuous desire for his two faults, his rashness
 for making the vow, and his impetuous desire for wishing for things back again which he had before
 abandoned. But if any one else brings it he shall not pay more than its value. (38) And let not the
 man who has made the vow make any long delay either in the accomplishment of his vow or in
 procuring a proper valuation to be made of it. For it is absurd to attempt to make strict covenants
 with men, but to look upon agreements made with God who has no need of any thing, and who has
 no deficiency of any thing as unnecessary to be observed, while those who do so are by their
 delays and slowness convicting themselves of the greatest of offences, namely, of a neglect of
 him whose service they ought to look upon as the beginning and end of all happiness. This is
 enough to say of oaths and Vows.{5}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: On the
 Number Seven. His next division begins and ends with roman numeral I (= X in the Loeb). The publisher has elected to
 follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 X. (39) The next commandment is that concerning the sacred seventh day, in which are
 comprehended an infinite number of most important festivals. For instance, there is the release of
 those men who by nature were free, but who, through some unforeseen necessity of the times,
 have become slaves, which release takes place every seventh year. Again, there is the humanity
 of creditors towards their debtors, as they forgive their countrymen their debts every seventh year.
 Also there is the rest given to the fertile ground, whether it be in the champaign or in the
 mountainous country, which also takes place every seventh year. Moreover, there are those
 ordinances which are established respecting the fiftieth year. And of all these things the bare
 narration (without looking to any inner and figurative signification) is sufficient to lead those who
 are well disposed to perfect virtue, and to make even those who are obstinate and stubborn in their
 dispositions more docile and tractable. (40) Now we have already spoken at some length about the
 virtue of the number seven, explaining what a nature it has in reference to the number ten; and also
 what a connection it has to the decade itself, and also to the number four, which is the foundation
 and the source of the decade. And now, having been compounded in regular order from the unit, it
 in regular order produces the perfect number twenty-eight; being multiplied according to a regular
 proportion equal in all its parts, it makes at last both a cube and a square. I also showed how there
 is an infinite number of beauties which may be extracted from a careful contemplation of it, on
 which we have not at present time to dilate. But we must examine every one of the special matters
 which are before us as comprehended in this one, beginning with the first. The first matter to be
 considered is that of the Festivals.{6}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: To Show
 That the Festivals Are Ten in Number. This "treatise" begins with roman numeral I (= XI in the Loeb), enumerates each of
 the ten festivals individually, and extends through Loeb number 214. The publisher has elected to follow the Loeb
 numbering.}
<p>
 XI. (41) Now there are ten festivals in number, as the law sets them down.
<p>
 The first is that which any one will perhaps be astonished to hear called a festival. This festival is
 every day.
<p>
 The second festival is the seventh day, which the Hebrews in their native language call the
 sabbath.
<p>
 The third is that which comes after the conjunction, which happens on the day of the new moon in
 each month.
<p>
 The fourth is that of the passover which is called the passover.
<p>
 The fifth is the first fruits of the corn--the sacred sheaf.
<p>
 The sixth is the feast of unleavened bread, after which that festival is celebrated, which is really
<p>
 The seventh day of seventh days.
<p>
 The eighth is the festival of the sacred moon, or the feast of trumpets.
<p>
 The ninth is the fast.
<p>
 The tenth is the feast of tabernacles, which is the last of all the annual festivals, ending so as to
 make the perfect number of ten. We must now begin with the first festival.
<p>
<p>                           THE FIRST FESTIVAL
<p>
 XII. (42) The law sets down every day as a festival, adapting itself to an irreproachable life, as if
 men continually obeyed nature and her injunctions. And if wickedness did not prosper, subduing by
 their predominant influence all those reasonings about what things might be expedient, which they
 have driven out of the soul of each individual, but if all the powers of the virtues remained in all
 respects unsubdued, then the whole time from a man's birth to his death would be one
 uninterrupted festival, and all houses and every city would pass their time in continual fearlessness
 and peace, being full of every imaginable blessing, enjoying perfect tranquillity. (43) But, as it is at
 present, covetousness and the system of mutual hostility and retaliation with which both men and
 women are continually forming designs against one another, and even against themselves, have
 destroyed the continuity of cheerfulness and happiness. And the proof of what I have just asserted
 is visible to all men; (44) for all those men, whether among the Greeks or among the barbarians,
 who are practisers of wisdom, living in a blameless and irreproachable manner, determining not to
 do any injustice, nor even to retaliate it when done to them, shunning all association with
 busy-bodies, in all the cities which they inhabit, avoid all courts of justice, and council halls, and
 market-places, and places of assembly, and, in short, every spot where any band or company of
 precipitate headstrong men is collected, (45) admiring, as it were, a life of peace and tranquillity,
 being the most devoted contemplators of nature and of all the things in it. Investigating earth and
 sea, and the air, and the heaven, and all the different natures in each of them; dwelling, if one may
 so say, in their minds, at least, with the moon, and the sun, and the whole company of the rest of
 the stars, both planets and fixed stars. Having their bodies, indeed, firmly planted on the earth, but
 having their souls furnished with wings, in order that thus hovering in the air they may closely
 survey all the powers above, looking upon them as in reality the most excellent of cosmopolites,
 who consider the whole world as their native city, and all the devotees of wisdom as their fellow
 citizens, virtue herself having enrolled them as such, to whom it has been entrusted to frame a
 constitution for their common city.
<p>
 XIII. (46) Being, therefore, full of all kinds of excellence, and being accustomed to disregard all
 those good things which affect the body and external circumstances, and being inured to look upon
 things indifferent as really indifferent, and being armed by study against the pleasures and
 appetites, and, in short, being always labouring to raise themselves above the passions, and being
 instructed to exert all their power to pull down the fortification which those appetites have built up,
 and being insensible to any impression which the attacks of fortune might make upon them,
 because they have previously estimated the power of its attacks in their anticipations (for
 anticipation makes even those things light which would be most terrible if unexpected), their minds
 in this manner calculating that nothing that happens is wholly strange, but having a kind of faint
 perception of everything as old and in some degree blunted. These men, being very naturally
 rendered cheerful by their virtues, pass the whole of their lives as a festival. (47) These men,
 however, are therefore but a small number, kindling in their different cities a sort of spark of
 wisdom, in order that virtue may not become utterly extinguished, and so be entirely extirpated from
 our race. (48) But if men everywhere agreed with this small number, and became, as nature
 originally designed that they should, all blameless and irreproachable, lovers of wisdom, delighting
 in all that is virtuous and honourable, and thinking that and that alone good, and looking on
 everything else as subordinate and slaves, as if they themselves were the masters of them, then
 all the cities would be full of happiness, being wholly free from all the things which are the causes of
 pain or fear, and full of all those which produce joy and cheerfulness. So that no time would ever
 cease to be the time of a happy life, but that the whole circle of the year would be one festival.
<p>
 XIV. (49) Wherefore, if truth were to be the judge, no wicked or worthless man can pass a time of
 festival, no not even for the briefest period, inasmuch as he must be continually pained by the
 consciousness of his own iniquities, even though, with his soul, and his voice, and his
 countenance, he may pretend to smile; for how can a man who is full of the most evil counsels, and
 who lives with folly, have any period of genuine joy? A man who is in every respect unfortunate and
 miserable, in his tongue, and his belly, and all his other members, (50) since he uses the first for
 the utterance of things which ought to be secret and buried in silence, and the second he fills full of
 abundance of strong wine and immoderate quantities of food out of gluttony, and the rest of his
 members he uses for the indulgence of unlawful desires and illicit connections, not only seeking to
 violate the marriage bed of others, but lusting unnaturally, and seeking to deface the manly
 character of the nature of man, and to change it into a womanlike appearance, for the sake of the
 gratification of his own polluted and accursed passions. (51) On which account the all-great
 Moses, seeing the pre-eminence of the beauty of that which is the real festival, looked upon it as
 too perfect for human nature and dedicated it to God himself, speaking thus, in these very words:
 "The feast of the Lord."{7}{#le 23:2.} (52) In considering the melancholy and fearful condition of
 the human race, and how full it is of innumerable evils, which the covetousness of the soul begets,
 which the defects of the body produce, and which all the inequalities of the soul inflict upon us, and
 which the retaliations of those among whom we live, both doing and suffering innumerable evils,
 are continually causing us, he then wondered whether any one being tossed about in such a sea of
 troubles, some brought on deliberately and others unintentionally, and never being able to rest in
 peace nor to cast anchor in the safe haven of a life free from danger, could by any possibility really
 keep a feast, not one in name, but one which should really be so, enjoying himself and being happy
 in the contemplation of the world and all the things in it, and in obedience to nature, and in a perfect
 harmony between his words and his actions, between his actions and his words. (53) On which
 account he necessarily said that the feasts belonged to God alone; for he alone is happy and
 blessed, having no participation in any evil whatever, but being full of all perfect blessings. Or
 rather, if one is to say the exact truth, being himself the good, who has showered all particular good
 things over the heaven and earth. (54) In reference to which fact, a certain pre-eminently virtuous
 mind among the people of old, {8}{#ge 18:10.} when all its passions were tranquil, smiled, being full
 of and completely penetrated with joy, and reasoning with itself whether perhaps to rejoice was not
 a peculiar attribute of God, and whether it might not itself miss this joy by pursuing what are thought
 delights by men, was timorous, and denied the laughter of her soul until she was comforted. (55)
 For the merciful God lightened her fear, bidding her by his holy word confess that she did laugh, in
 order to teach us that the creature is not wholly and entirely deprived of joy; but that joy is
 unmingled and the purest of all which can receive nothing of an opposite nature, the chosen
 peculiar joy of God. But the joy which flows from that is a mingled one, being alloyed, being that of a
 man who is already wise, and who has received as the most valuable gift possible such a mixture
 as that in which the pleasant are far more numerous than the unpleasant ingredients. And this is
 enough to say on this subject.
<p>
<p>                          THE SECOND FESTIVAL
<p>
 XV. (56) But after this continued and uninterrupted festival which thus lasts through all time, there is
 another celebrated, namely, that of the sacred seventh day after each recurring interval of six
 days, which some have denominated the virgin, looking at its exceeding sanctity and purity. And
 others have called the motherless, as being produced by the Father of the universe alone, as a
 specimen of the male kind unconnected with the sex of women; for the number seven is a most
 brave and valiant number, well adapted by nature for government and authority. Some, again, have
 called it the occasion, forming their conjectures of that part of its essence which is appreciable
 only by the intellect, from the objects intelligible to their outward senses. (57) For whatever is best
 among the objects of the external senses, the things by means of which the seasons of the year
 and the revolutions of time are brought to perfection in their appointed order, partake of the
 number seven. I mean that there are seven planets; that the stars of the Bear are seven, that the
 Pleiads are seven, and the revolutions of the moon when increasing and waning, and the orderly
 well-regulated circuits of the other bodies, the beauty of which exceeds all description. (58) But
 Moses, from a most honourable cause, called it consummation and perfection; attributing to the
 number six the origination of all the parts of the world, and to the number seven their perfection; for
 the number six is an oddeven number, being composed of twice three, having the odd number for
 the male and the even number for the female, from the union of which, production takes place in
 accordance with the unalterable laws of nature. (59) But the number seven is free from all such
 commixture, and is, if one must speak plainly, the light of the number six; for what the number six
 engendered, that the number seven displayed when brought to perfection. In reference to which
 fact it may properly be called the birthday of the world, as the day in which the work of the Father,
 being exhibited as perfect with all its parts perfect, was commanded to rest and abstain from all
 works. (60) Not that the law is the adviser of idleness, for it is always accustoming its followers to
 submit to hardships, and training them to labour, and it hates those who desire to be indolent and
 idle; at all events, it expressly commands us to labour diligently for six days, {9}{#ex 20:9.} but in
 order to give some remission from uninterrupted and incessant toil, it refreshes the body with
 seasons of moderate relaxation exactly measured out, so as to renew it again for fresh works. For
 those who take breath in this way, I am speaking not merely about private individuals but even
 about athletes, collect fresh strength, and with more vigorous power, without any shrinking and with
 great endurance, encounter everything that must be done. (61) And the works meant are those
 enjoined by precepts and doctrines in accordance with virtue. And in the day he exhorts us to apply
 ourselves to philosophy, improving our souls and the dominant part of us, our mind. (62)
 Accordingly, on the seventh day there are spread before the people in every city innumerable
 lessons of prudence, and temperance, and courage, and justice, and all other virtues; during the
 giving of which the common people sit down, keeping silence and pricking up their ears, with all
 possible attention, from their thirst for wholesome instruction; but some of those who are very
 learned explain to them what is of great importance and use, lessons by which the whole of their
 lives may be improved. (63) And there are, as we may say, two most especially important heads of
 all the innumerable particular lessons and doctrines; the regulating of one's conduct towards God
 by the rules of piety and holiness, and of one's conduct towards men by the rules of humanity and
 justice; each of which is subdivided into a great number of subordinate ideas, all praiseworthy. (64)
 From which considerations it is plain that Moses does not leave those persons at any time idle who
 submit to be guided by his sacred admonitions; but since we are composed of both soul and body,
 he has allotted to the body such work as is suited to it, and to the soul also such tasks as are good
 for that. And he has taken care that the one shall succeed the other, so that while the body is
 labouring the soul may be at rest, and when the body is enjoying relaxation the soul may be
 labouring; and so the best lives with the contemplative and the active life, succeed to one another
 in regular alternations. The active life having received the number six, according to the service
 appointed for the body; and the contemplative life the number seven, as tending to knowledge and
 to the perfecting of the intellect.
<p>
 XVI. (65) It is forbidden also on this day to kindle a fire, as being the beginning and seed of all the
 business of life; since without fire it is not possible to make any of the things which are
 indispensably necessary for life, so that men in the absence of one single element, the highest and
 most ancient of all, are cut off from all works and employments of arts, especially from all
 handicraft trades, and also from all particular services. (66) But it seems likely that it was on
 account of those who were less obedient, and who were the least inclined to attend to what was
 done, that Moses gave additional laws, besides, thinking it right, not only that those who were free
 should abstain from all works on the seventh day, but also that their servants and handmaids
 should have a respite from their tasks, proclaiming a day of freedom to them also after every
 space of six days, in order to teach both classes this most admirable lesson; (67) so that the
 masters should be accustomed to do some things with their own hands, not waiting for the services
 and ministrations of their servants, in order that if any unforeseen necessities came upon them,
 according to the changes which take place in human affairs, they might not, from being wholly
 unaccustomed to do anything for themselves, faint at what they had to do; but, finding the different
 parts of the body active and handy, might work with ease and cheerfulness; and teaching the
 servants not to despair of better prospects, but having a relaxation every six days as a kind of
 spark and kindling of freedom, to look forward to a complete relaxation hereafter, if they continued
 faithful and attached to their masters. (68) And from the occurrence of the free men at times
 submitting to the tasks of servants, and of the servants enjoying a respite and holiday, it will arise
 that the life of mankind advances in improvement towards perfect virtue, from their being thus
 reminded of the principles of equality, and repaying each other with necessary services, both
 those of high and those of obscure rank. (69) But the law has given a relaxation, not to servants
 only on the seventh day, but also to the cattle. And yet by nature the servants are born free; for no
 man is by nature a slave. But other animals are expressly made for the use and service of man,
 and are therefore ranked as slaves; but, nevertheless, those that ought to bear burdens, and to
 endure toil and labour on behalf of their owners, do all find a respite on the seventh day. (70) And
 why need I mention other particulars? The ox, the animal who is born for the most important and
 most useful of all the purposes of life, namely, for the plough, when the earth is already prepared
 for seed; and again, when the sheaves are brought into the barn, for threshing in order to the
 purification of the crop, is on this day unharnessed, keeping as a festival that day which is the
 birthday of the year. And thus its holiness pervades every thing and affects every creature.
<p>
 XVII. (71) And Moses thinks the number seven worthy of such reverence that even all other things
 which at all partake of it are honoured by him; at all events, on every seventh year he ordains a
 remission of debts, assisting the poor, and inviting the rich to humanity; {10}{#de 15:1.} that so
 they, from their abundance, giving to those that are in want, may also look forward to receiving
 services from them in the case of any disaster happening to them. For the accidents of human life
 are numerous, and life is not always anchored on the same bottom, but is apt to change like the
 fickle wind which blows in different directions at different times. (72) It is well, therefore, that the
 kindness shown by the creditors should extend to all the debtors. But since all men are not naturally
 inclined to magnanimity, but some men are the slaves of money, or perhaps not very rich, the law
 has appointed that they should contribute what will not inconvenience them when parted with. (73)
 For while it does not permit them to lend on usury to their fellow countrymen, it has allowed them to
 receive interest from foreigners; calling the former, with great felicity of expression, their brothers,
 in order to prevent any one's grudging to give of his possessions to those who are as if by nature
 joint inheritors with themselves; but those who are not their fellow countrymen are called strangers,
 as is very natural. For the being a stranger shows that a person has no right to a participation in
 any thing, unless, indeed, any one out of an excess of virtue should treat even those in the
 conditions of strangers as kindred and related, from having been bred up under a virtuous state of
 things, and under virtuous laws which look upon what is virtuous alone as good. (74) But the action
 of lending on usury is blameable; for a man who lends on usury has not abundant means of living,
 but is clearly in some want; and he does so as being compelled to add the interest to his principal in
 order to subsist, and so he at last becomes of necessity very poor; and while he thinks that he is
 deriving advantage he is in reality injured, just as foolish animals are when they are deceived by a
 present bait. (75) But I should say to such persons, "O you who lend on usury, why do you seek to
 disguise your unsociable disposition by an apparent pretence of good fellowship? And why do you
 in words, indeed, pretend to be a humane and considerate person, while in your actions you exhibit
 a want of humanity and a terrible hardness of heart, exacting more than you gave, and sometimes
 even doubling your original loan, so as to make the poor man an absolute beggar? (76) Therefore
 no one sympathises with you in your distress, when, having endeavoured to obtain more, you fail to
 do so, and besides lose even what you had before. But, on the contrary, all men are glad of your
 misfortunes, calling you a usurer, and a skinflint, and all kinds of names like those, looking on you
 as one who lies in wait for human misfortunes, and who esteems the misfortunes of others his own
 prosperity." (77) But, as some have said, wickedness is a most laborious thing; and he who lends
 on usury is blind, not seeing the time of repayment, in which he will scarcely, or perhaps not at all,
 receive the things which in his covetousness he had hoped to gain. (78) Let such a man pay the
 penalty of his avaricious disposition, not recovering back what he has expended, so as to make a
 gain of the misfortunes of men, deriving a revenue from unbecoming sources. But let the debtors
 be thought worthy of a humanity enjoined by the law, not paying back their loans and usurious
 interest upon them, but paying back merely the original sum lent. For again, at a proper season,
 they will give the same assistance to those who have aided them, requiting those who set the
 example of kindness with equal services.
<p>
 XVIII. (79) After having given these commandments, Moses proceeds in regular order to establish
 a law full of all gentleness and humanity. "If," says this law, "one of thy brethren be sold to thee, let
 him serve thee for six years; and in the seventh year let him be set free without any
 Payment,"{11}{#de 15:12.} (80) Here again Moses calls their fellow countrymen their brothers,
 implanting in the soul of the owner by this appellation an idea of relationship to his servant, that he
 may not neglect him as a stranger, towards whom he has no bond of goodwill. But that, yielding to a
 feeling of affection for him as a relation, in consequence of the lesson which the holy scripture thus
 suggests, he may not feel indignant when his servant is about to recover his freedom. (81) For it
 has come to pass that such men are called slaves (douloi), but they are in reality only servants
 (thetes), serving their masters for the sake of their necessities. And even though they had a
 thousand times over given their masters absolute power and authority over them, (82) still their
 masters ought to be gentle to them, considering these beautiful injunctions of the law. O man, he is
 a hireling who is called a slave, and he also is a man, having a most sublime relationship to you,
 inasmuch as he is of the same nation as yourself; and perhaps he is even of the same tribe and
 the same borough as yourself, and is now reduced to this condition through want. (83) Do you,
 therefore, casting out of your soul that treacherous evil, insolence, behave to him as if he were a
 hireling, giving some things and receiving others. And so he will, with all energy and cheerfulness
 perform the services due to you, at all times and in all places, never delaying, but by his speed and
 willingness anticipating your commands. And do you, in return, provide him with food and raiment,
 and take all other necessary care of him; not yoking him to the plough like a brute beast, and not
 oppressing him with heavy burdens beyond his power to bear, nor treating him with insolence, nor
 reducing him to painful despondency by threats and infliction of punishment; but giving him proper
 relaxation and well-regulated periods of rest; for the precept, "Let nothing be too much," applies to
 every case, and especially to the conduct of masters to their servants. (84) Therefore, when he
 has served you for a very sufficient time, for six years, then, when the most sacred number, the
 seventh year is about to arrive, let him who is free by nature depart in freedom; and grant him this
 kindness without hesitating as to your part, my good man, but joyfully, because you have now an
 opportunity of doing a service to that most excellent of all animals, man, in the most important of all
 matters; for there is no blessing to a slave greater than freedom. (85) Do you, therefore, set him
 free joyfully; and, moreover, make him a present from your own property, from each portion of your
 possessions, giving to him who has served you faithfully means to support himself on his journey.
 For it will tend to your credit if he does not leave your house in poverty but having a plentiful supply
 for all his necessities, so that he may not again, through want, fall into his previous calamity,
 namely, slavery, being compelled through want of his daily food to sell himself, and so your
 kindness will be lost. This, then, is enough to say about the poor.
<p>
 XIX. (86) In the next place Moses commands the people to leave the land fallow and untilled every
 seventh year, for many reasons; {12}{#le 25:4.} first of all, that they may honour the number
 seven, or each period of days, and months, and years; for every seventh day is sacred, which is
 called by the Hebrews the sabbath; and the seventh month in every year has the greatest of the
 festivals allotted to it, so that very naturally the seventh year also has a share of the veneration
 paid to this number, and receives especial honour. (87) And the second reason is this, "Be not,"
 says the lawgiver, "wholly devoted to gain, but even willingly submit to some loss," that so you may
 bear with the more indifference involuntary calamity if it should ever fall upon you, and not grieve
 and despond, as if at some new and strange occurrence; for there are some rich men so
 unfortunate in their dispositions, as, when want comes upon them, to groan and despond no less
 than they might do if they were deprived of all their substance. (88) But of the followers of Moses,
 all who are true disciples, being practised in good laws, are accustomed, from their earliest age, to
 bear want with patience, by the custom of leaving their fertile land fallow; and being also taught
 magnanimity, and one may almost say, to let slip out of their hands, from deliberate intention,
 revenues of admitted certainty. (89) The third reason appears to me to be thus, which is intimated
 in a somewhat figurative manner, namely, to show that it does not become any one whatever to
 weigh down and oppress men with burdens; for if one is to allow a period of rest to the portions of
 the earth which cannot by nature have any share in the feelings of pleasure or of pain, how much
 the more must men be entitled to a similar relaxation, who have not only these outward senses,
 which are common to the brute beasts, but also the especial gift of reason, by which the painful
 feelings which arise from toil and fatigue, are more vividly imprinted on their imaginations? (90)
 Cease, therefore, ye who are called masters, from imposing harsh and intolerable commands on
 your slaves, which break the strength of the body by their compulsion, and compel the soul to faint
 even before the bodies; (91) for there is no objection to your exerting a moderate degree of
 authority, giving orders by which you will receive the services to which you are entitled, and in
 consequence of which your servants will cheerfully do what they are desired; and then they will
 discharge their duties but for a short period, as if early exhausted, and, if one must say the truth,
 brought by their labours to old age before their time; but like athletes, preserving their youthful
 vigour for a long time, who do not become fat and corpulent, but who are accustomed, by exertion
 and sweat, to train themselves, so as to be able to acquire the things which are necessary and
 useful for life. (92) Moreover let the governors of cities cease to oppress them with continual and
 excessive taxes and tributes, filling their own stores with money, and in preserving as a treasure
 the illiberal vices which defile their whole lives; (93) for they do, on purpose, select as collectors of
 their revenues the most pitiless of men, persons full of all kinds of inhumanity, giving them abundant
 opportunity for the exercise of their covetousness; and they, in addition to their own innate severity
 of temper, receiving free license from the commands of their masters, and having determined to
 do everything so as to please them, practise all the harshest measures which they can imagine,
 having no notion of gentleness or humanity, not even in their dreams; (94) therefore they throw
 everything into disorder and confusion, levying their exactions, not only on the possessions of the
 citizens, but also on their persons, with insults and violence, and the invention of new and
 unprecedented torture. And before now I have heard of some persons who, in their ferocity and
 unequalled fury, have not spared even the dead; but have been so brutal as even to venture to
 beat the dead corpses with goads; (95) and when some one blamed their brutality, in that not even
 death, that relief and real end of all miseries, could prevent their victims from being insulted by
 them, but that, instead of a grave and the customary funeral rites, they were exposed to continued
 insult, they made a defence worse even than the accusation brought against them, saying that they
 were insulting the dead, not for the sake of abusing the dumb and senseless dust, for there was no
 advantage in that, but for the sake of making those who through ties of blood or of friendship were
 nearly connected with them feel compassion for them, and so inducing them to pay a ransom for
 their bodies, thus doing them the last service in their power.
<p>
 XX. (96) Then, O you most worthless of all men! I would say to them, have you not first learnt what
 you are now teaching? or do you know how to invite other people to compassion even by the most
 inhuman actions, and yet have you eradicated all merciful and humane feelings from your own
 souls? And do you act in this way in spite of not being in want of good advisers, and especially of
 our laws, which have released even the earth from its yearly burdens, giving it a relaxation and a
 respite? (97) and it, although it seems to be inanimate, is nevertheless fully prepared to make a
 requital and to recompence favours, hastening to pay back any gift which it has received; for as it
 receives an exemption every seventh year, and is not forced to exert itself that year, but is set
 wholly free for the whole circle of the year, in the subsequent year produces double, or sometimes,
 many times, larger crops than usual from its great productiveness. (98) And in like manner you
 may see the trainers acting in the same way towards the athletes; for when they are exercising
 them with continual and uninterrupted practice, before they are wholly knocked up, they refresh
 them, giving a respite not only from their exertions in training, but also from their strict regimen of
 eating and drinking, relaxing the severity of their diet so as to produce a cheerfulness of soul and
 good condition of body. (99) And yet they are not to be looked upon as teachers of indolence and
 luxury, inasmuch as their professed business is to train men to the endurance of labours, but by a
 certain method and artificial system they add to their natural strength a strength more powerful still,
 and to their innate vigour a more energetic vigour still, increasing their previous powers by
 reciprocal remission and exertion, as by a well-regulated harmony. (100) And I have learnt all this
 from all-wise nature, which, knowing the industrious and laborious condition of our race, has
 distributed them into day and night, giving to us the one for wakefulness, and the other for sleep;
 (101) for she felt a natural anxiety, like a careful mother, that her offspring should not be worn out
 with toil; for by day she excites our bodies, and rouses them up to all the necessities and duties
 belonging to life, compelling those to work who would gladly be accustomed to cultivate the leisure
 of idleness, and an effeminate and luxurious life. But by night, as if she were sounding a retreat in
 time of war, she invites us to rest, and to take care of our bodies. (102) And those men who have
 laid aside a heavy weight of business, which has lasted from morning till evening, do now lay their
 burdens aside and return home and devote themselves to ease, and indulging in profound sleep,
 refresh themselves after the labours of the day. (103) This long interval between sleeping and
 waking nature has allotted to men, that they may by turns labour diligently and by turns rest, so as
 to have all the parts of their bodies more ready for action, and more active and powerful.
<p>
 XXI. (104) And the lawgiver, who is a prophetic spirit, gave us our laws, having a regard to these
 things, and proclaimed a holiday to the whole country, restraining the farmers from cultivating the
 land after each six years' incessant industry. But it was not only on account of the motives which I
 have mentioned that he gave these injunctions, but also because of his innate humanity, which he
 thinks fit to weave in with every part of his legislation, stamping on all who study the holy scriptures
 a sociable and humane disposition. (105) For he commands his people every seventh year to
 forbear to enclose any piece of land, but to let all the olive gardens and vineyards remain open,
 and all their other possessions, whether they be seed-land or trees, that so the poor may be able
 to enjoy the spontaneously growing crops without fear, in a greater, or at all events not in a less
 degree than the owners themselves. (106) On which account he does not allow the masters to
 cultivate the land, having in view the object of not causing them any annoyance from the feeling that
 they are at all the expense, but that they do not receive any revenue from their lands to make up
 for the expense, while the poor enjoy all the crops as their own; and he permits those who appear
 to be strangers to enjoy all these things, raising them from their apparent lowly condition, and from
 the reproach of being beggars. (107) Is it not then fit to love these laws which are full of such
 abundant humanity? by which the rich men are taught to share the blessings which they have with
 and to communicate them to others: and the poor are comforted, not being for ever compelled to
 frequent the houses of the indigent to supply the deficiencies by which they themselves are
 oppressed; (108) but there are times when the widows and orphan children, as if they had been
 deriving a revenue from their own properties, namely the spontaneously growing crops, as I have
 said before, and all other classes of person who are disregarded from not being wealthy do at last
 find themselves in the possession of plenty, being on a sudden enriched by the gift of God, who
 has called them to share with the possessors themselves in the number of the sacred seven.
 (109) And all those who breed flocks and herds lend their own cattle with fearlessness and impunity
 to graze on the land of others, choosing the most fertile plains, and the lands most suitable for the
 feeding of their cattle, availing themselves of the license of the jubilee; and they are not met by any
 ill-will or illiberality on the part of the masters, as having the property in these lands by old custom,
 which having prevailed for a very long time, so as to become familiar, has now prevailed even over
 nature.
<p>
 XXII. (110) Having laid down these principles as a kind of foundation of gentleness and humanity,
 he then puts together seven sevens of years, and so makes the fiftieth year an entirely sacred
 year, enacting with reference to it some ordinances of especial honour beyond those which relate
 to the ordinary years of communication of property. (111) In the first place he gives this
 commandment. He thinks it fitting that all property that has been alienated should now be restored
 to its original masters in order that the inheritances originally apportioned to the different tribes
 may be preserved, and that no one who originally received an allotment may be wholly deprived of
 his possessions. (112) Since it often happens that unforeseen circumstances come upon men by
 which they are compelled to sell what belongs to them. And so he provided in a suitable manner for
 their necessities, and prevented those who purchased the lands from being deceived, allowing the
 one to sell their lands, and teaching the others very plainly the conditions on which they are going
 to purchase. (113) For the law says Do not give a price as if for an everlasting possession, but
 only for a definite number of years, which must be less than fifty; for the sale effected ought not to
 be a sale of the lands owned, but a sale of the crops, for two most weighty reasons; one, that the
 whole country is called the possession of God, and it is impious for any one else to be recorded as
 the masters of the possessions of God; and secondly, because a separate allotment has been
 assigned to each land-owner, of which the law does not choose the man who originally received
 the allotment to be deprived. (114) Therefore, the law invites the man who is able to recover his
 original property within the period of fifty years, or any one of his nearest relations, to use every
 exertion to repay the price which he received, and not to be the cause of loss to the man who
 purchased it, and who served him at a time when he was in need of assistance. (115) And at the
 same time it sympathises with the man who is in too great a state of indigence to do so, and
 bestows its compassion on him, giving him back his former property with the exception of any fields
 which have been consecrated by a vow, and are so placed in the class of offerings to God. And it
 is contrary to divine law that any thing which has been offered to God should ever by lapse of time
 become profane. On which account it is commanded that the accurate value of those fields shall
 be fully exacted, without showing any favour to the man who dedicated the offering.
<p>
 XXIII. (116) These are the commandments which are given with respect to the divisions of the land
 and the inheritances so portioned out. There are others also enacted with respect to houses. And
 since of houses some are in cities, being within walls; while others are open abodes in the country,
 and not within any walls; the law has directed that those in the country shall always be redeemed
 with money, and that those which are not redeemed before the fiftieth year shall be restored
 without any payment to their original owners, just as their other possessions; {13}{#le 25:31.} for
 the houses are a portion of the man's possessions. (117) But those which are within walls shall be
 liable to be redeemed by those who have sold them for a full year; {14}{#le 25:19.} but if they be
 not redeemed within that year, then after that year they shall be confirmed to those who had bought
 them, the jubilee of the fiftieth year not injuring the claim of the purchasers. (118) And the reason
 of these enactments is that God wills to give even to strangers an opportunity of becoming firmly
 established in the land. For since they have no participation in the land, inasmuch as they are not
 numbered among those to whom the inheritances have been apportioned, the law has allotted to
 them a property in houses, being desirous that they who have come as suppliants to the laws, and
 who have taken refuge under their protection, should not be homeless wanderers in the land. (119)
 For the cities, when the land was originally portioned out in inheritances, were not divided among
 the tribes, nor indeed were they originally built together in streets, but the inhabitants of the land
 preferred to make their abode in their open houses in the fields. But afterwards they quitted these
 houses and came together, the feeling of a love of fellowship and communication, as was natural,
 becoming stronger after a lapse of time, and so they built houses in the same place, and cities, of
 which they allowed a share also to the strangers, that they might not be destitute of every thing both
 in the country and in the cities.
<p>
 XXIV. (120) And concerning the tribe which was set apart as consecrated for the priesthood, the
 following laws are established. The law did not bestow upon the keepers of the temple any portion
 of the land, considering the first fruits of it a sufficient revenue for them. But it allotted them eight
 and forty cities to dwell in, and a suburb of two thousand cubits around each City.{15}{#le 35:5..}
 (121) Therefore, it did not confirm the houses in these cities in the same manner that it did those in
 the other cities which are built within walls, to the purchasers, if those who had sold them were not
 able to redeem them within the year, but it permitted them to be redeemed at any time, like the open
 houses in the country taken from the gentiles, to which they corresponded. Since the Levites had
 received only houses in this district, of which the lawgiver did not think it fit that those who received
 them should be deprived any more than those to whom the allotments of the open houses in the
 country had fallen. And this is enough to say about the houses.
<p>
 XXV. (122) But the laws established with respect to those who owed money to usurers, and to
 those who had become servants to masters, resemble those already mentioned; that the usurers
 shall not exact usurers' interest from their fellow countrymen, but shall be contented to receive
 back only what they lent; and that the masters shall behave to those whom they have bought with
 their money not as if they were by nature slaves, but only hirelings, giving them immunity and liberty,
 at once, indeed, to those who can pay down a ransom for themselves, and at a subsequent period
 to the indigent, either when the seventh year from the beginning of their slavery arrives, or when
 the fiftieth year comes, even if a man happen to have fallen into slavery only the day before. For
 this year both is and is looked upon as a year of remission; every one retracing his steps and
 turning back again to his previous state of prosperity. (123) But the law permits the people to
 acquire a property in slaves who are not of their own countrymen, but who are of different nations;
 intending in the first place that there should be a difference between one's own countrymen and
 strangers, and secondly, not desiring completely to exclude from the constitution that most entirely
 indispensable property of slaves; for there are an innumerable host of circumstances in life which
 require the ministrations of Servants.{16}{sections 124139 were omitted in Yonge's translation because the
 edition on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked this material. These lines have been newly translated for
 this edition.} (124) Sons shall inherit their parents' property, but if there should be no sons, then the
 daughters would inherit. For just as in their nature men take precedence over women, so also in
 families they shall have the first share, inheriting property and filling the station of those who have
 died, being held by a law of necessity that lets no earthborn mortal live forever. (125) But if virgins
 are left behind with unmarried, no dowry having been set apart by the parents while they were still
 living, they shall receive a share equal to that of the males. But the presiding power must take care
 to watch over those who are left behind and of their growth and of the expenses for sustenance
 and the training that is appropriate for girls, and, whenever the time should come, for appropriate
 marriage, husbands approved in all things having been selected by merit. (126) Preferably they
 should be relatives, but if not, they should at least be of the same deme and tribe, so that the lots
 assigned as dowries will not be alienated through marriages but remain in the tribal allotments as
 ordered from the beginning. (127) But if someone should have no offspring, then let the brothers of
 the deceased succeed to the inheritance. For the place in the family after sons and daughters
 belongs to brothers. And if someone who has no brothers should die, the uncles on the father's
 side should succeed to the property, and if there are no uncles, then the aunts, the closest of the
 remaining household members and other relatives. (128) But if scarcity should seize the family, so
 that no blood relations are left, then let the tribe be the heir. For the tribe is also a kind of family, if
 we draw a larger and more complete circle. (129) The perplexity raised by some, however, should
 be laid to rest: Seeing that the law mentions all members of the family, the deme, and the tribe in
 the order of succession to inheritances, why did it remain silent only about parents, who, it would
 seem, should be just as eligible to inherit their children's property as the children are to inherit
 theirs? Here is the answer, my good fellow! Since the law is divine, and since it always aims at
 following the logic of nature, it did not wish to introduce any ill-omened provisions; for parents pray
 to leave behind living offspring who will have succeeded to their name, their lineage, and their
 property, while their worst enemies call down the opposite on them as a curse, namely, that the
 sons and daughters should die before their parents. (130) Therefore in order to avoid making
 explicit provisions for a situation that would be illfitting and discordant with the harmony and
 concord that characterize the administration of the whole cosmos--namely, the case where
 children die and parents survive--the law both necessarily and fittingly omitted ordering that
 mothers and fathers should inherit the property of sons and daughters, knowing that this outcome
 was out of accord with life and nature. (131) So then, the law was careful not to say in so many
 words that parents inherit when their children die, in order not to seem to reproach grieving parents
 by allotting to them a benefit that no one would want, and in order not to call misfortunes to mind;
 but it allotted the property to them in another way, as a small consolation for a great evil. (132)
 How, then, does it do this? It puts down the father's brother as the heir of his nephews, no doubt
 rewarding the uncle for the father's sake--unless anyone is so silly as to suppose that one who
 honors someone for the sake of someone else thereby chooses to dishonor the latter. Those who
 pay attention to their friends' acquaintances do not thereby neglect their friends, do they? Do not
 those who show the most solicitous care for those whom they honor also welcome their friends? In
 precisely the same way, when when the law names the father's brother to share in the inheritance
 on account of the father, how much more does it name the father! It does not do this explicitly, for
 the reasons cited, but it makes clear the will of the lawgiver with surer force than an explicit
 mention. (133) The eldest son does not share equally with those who came after him but is
 considered worthy of a double portion, since two people who were previously husband and wife
 became father and mother on account of the first offspring, and once he came along he was the
 first to call those who engendered him by these names. Furthermore--and this is the most
 essential point--the household that was previously childless became one blessed with a son for
 the continuance of the human race. The seed of this continuance is marriage, and its fruit is the
 begetting of children, of whom the eldest is the head. (134) I suppose that it is for this reason that
 the firstborn sons of the enemies who had given no quarter, as the holy scriptures reveal, were all
 cut off in their youth in one night, while the firstborn of the people of the nation were dedicated to
 God as a thank-offering and were thus consecrated. For it was necessary to weigh down the
 former with a heavy and inconsolable grief, the destruction of those who held first place, but to
 reward the savior God with the firstfruits, whose lot was the preeminence among the children.
 (135) But there are some men who after getting married and having children have at length
 unlearned prudence and drifted into incontinence. Lusting after other women, these men have
 wronged their first wives and behaved toward their children from them no longer as fathers but as
 uncles, imitating the impious behavior of stepmothers toward previously born children. They have
 given themselves and their property over entirely to their new wives and to their sons, having been
 overcome by pleasure, the most shameful passion. The law would not have hesitated to bridle
 these lusts somehow if it had been possible, lest they kick up their heels even more; (136) but
 since it was difficult, or rather impossible, to cure this wild frenzy, the law abandoned the man as
 being in the grip of an incurable disease. It did not, however, overlook the son of the woman
 wronged on account of the new love but commanded that he should receive a double share of the
 distribution left for the brothers. (137) There are many reasons for this. For in the first place it
 punishes the guilty man by compelling him to do something good for the son whom he has chosen
 to treat badly; and it makes clear the invalidity of his inconsiderate judgment in that it profits the one
 who was in danger of suffering loss at his hands by putting itself in the role of the parent--the role
 abandoned by the natural father with regard to the firstborn son. (138) Secondly, it shows mercy
 and compassion on those who have been treated unjustly, whose burden of distress it lightens by
 giving them a share in grace and gift; for the double portion of the inheriting son was no less likely
 to please the mother, who will be encouraged by the kindness of the law, which did not permit her
 and her offspring to be totally overcome by their enemies. (139) In the third place, being a good
 referee of justice, it considered in itself that the father had freely lavished provisions upon the sons
 of the beloved wife due to his affection for her, while he considered the sons of the hated wife to
 deserve nothing due to his hatred for their mother. Thus the former had inherited more than their
 equal share during his lifetime, while the latter were in danger even upon his death of being
 deprived of the whole patrimony. So then, in order to equalize the distribution to the sons of both
 wives, it set aside a double portion as the rightful inheritance of the eldest, the son of the wife who
 had been put away. This is enough regarding these things.
<p>
<p>                           THE THIRD FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXVI. (140) Following the order which we have adopted, we proceed to speak of the third festival,
 that of the new moon. First of all, because it is the beginning of the month, and the beginning,
 whether of number or of time, is honourable. Secondly, because at this time there is nothing in the
 whole of heaven destitute of light. (141) Thirdly, because at that period the more powerful and
 important body gives a portion of necessary assistance to the less important and weaker body; for,
 at the time of the new moon, the sun begins to illuminate the moon with a light which is visible to the
 outward senses, and then she displays her own beauty to the beholders. And this is, as it seems,
 an evident lesson of kindness and humanity to men, to teach them that they should never grudge to
 impart their own good things to others, but, imitating the heavenly bodies, should drive envy away
 and banish it from the Soul.{17}{sections 142-144 were omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which
 Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked this material. These lines have been newly translated for this volume.}
 (142) The fourth reason is that of all the bodies in the heaven, the moon traverses the zodiac in
 the least appointed time: it accomplishes its orbit in a monthly interval. For this reason the law has
 honored the end of its orbit, the point when the moon has finished at the beginning point from which
 it began to travel, by having called that day a feast so that it might again teach us an excellent
 lesson that in the affairs of life we should make the ends harmonious with the beginnings. This will
 happen if we hold the reins on our first impulses with the power of reason and do not permit them to
 refuse the reins and to run free like animals without anyone in charge of the herd. (143) With
 regard to the benefits which the moon provides to all on earth, why is it necessary to run through
 and detail them? Their proofs are obvious. Or isn't it by its waxings that rivers and springs
 overflow, and again by its wanings that they diminish; that seas sometimes retreat and are drawn
 down through their ebb and flow, and at other times suddenly run full through the tide; that the air
 experiences all sorts of shifts in the form of clear weather, cloudy weather, and other changes?
 Don't the fruits of cultivated crops and trees grow and come to maturity through the orbits of the
 moon which nurses and ripens each of the growing crops through dewladen and very gentle
 breezes? (144) But this is not the appropriate occasion, as I said, to speak at length about the
 praise of the moon by running through and enumerating the benefits which it provides to animals
 and to all on the earth. For these reasons and others similar to them, the new moon has been
 honored and taken its place among the feasts.
<p>
<p>                          THE FOURTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXVII. (145) And after the feast of the new moon comes the fourth festival, that of the passover,
 which the Hebrews call pascha, on which the whole people offer sacrifice, beginning at noonday
 and continuing till evening. (146) And this festival is instituted in remembrance of, and as giving
 thanks for, their great migration which they made from Egypt, with many myriads of people, in
 accordance with the commands of God given to them; leaving then, as it seems, a country full of all
 inhumanity and practising every kind of inhospitality, and (what was worst of all) giving the honour
 due to God to brute beasts; and, therefore, they sacrificed at that time themselves out of their
 exceeding joy, without waiting for priests. And what was then done the law enjoined to be repeated
 once every year, as a memorial of the gratitude due for their deliverance. These things are thus
 related in accordance with the ancient historic accounts. (147) But those who are in the habit of
 turning plain stories into allegory, argue that the passover figuratively represents the purification of
 the soul; for they say that the lover of wisdom is never practising anything else except a passing
 over from the body and the passions. (148) And each house is at that time invested with the
 character and dignity of a temple, the victim being sacrificed so as to make a suitable feast for the
 man who has provided it and of those who are collected to share in the feast, being all duly purified
 with holy ablutions. And those who are to share in the feast come together not as they do to other
 entertainments, to gratify their bellies with wine and meat, but to fulfil their hereditary custom with
 prayer and songs of praise. (149) And this universal sacrifice of the whole people is celebrated on
 the fourteenth day of the month, which consists of two periods of seven, in order that nothing which
 is accounted worthy of honour may be separated from the number seven. But this number is the
 beginning of brilliancy and dignity to everything.
<p>
<p>                           THE FIFTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXVIII. (150) And there is another festival combined with the feast of the passover, having a use
 of food different from the usual one, and not customary; the use, namely, of unleavened bread,
 from which it derives its name. And there are two accounts given of this festival, the one peculiar to
 the nation, on account of the migration already described; the other a common one, in accordance
 with conformity to nature and with the harmony of the whole world. And we must consider how
 accurate the hypothesis is. This month, being the seventh both in number and order, according to
 the revolutions of the sun, is the first in power; (151) on which account it is also called the first in
 the sacred scriptures. And the reason, as I imagine, is as follows. The vernal equinox is an
 imitation and representation of that beginning in accordance with which this world was created.
 Accordingly, every year, God reminds men of the creation of the world, and with this view puts
 forward the spring, in which season all plants flourish and bloom; (152) for which reason this is
 very correctly set down in the law as the first month, since, in a manner, it may be said to be an
 impression of the first beginning of all, being stamped by it as by an archetypal Seal.{18}{sections
 153154 were omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked
 this material. These lines have been newly translated for this volume.} (153) Although the month in which the
 autumnal equinox occurs is first in sequence according to solar orbits, it is not considered first in
 the law. The reason is that at that time, after all the crops have been harvested, the trees lose their
 leaves and everything that springtime produced in the height of its glory is withering under dry winds
 after it has been made dry by the flaming heat of the sun. (154) Therefore he thought that to apply
 the name "first" to the month in which the hill country and the plain become barren and infertile, was
 incongruous and unfitting. For it is necessary that the most beautiful and desirable phenomena
 belong to those things which are first and have received the position of leadership, those
 phenomena through which the reproduction and growth of animals and fruit and crops take place,
 but not the ominous destructive forces. (155) And this feast is begun on the fifteenth day of the
 month, in the middle of the month, on the day on which the moon is full of light, in consequence of
 the providence of God taking care that there shall be no darkness on that day. (156) And, again,
 the feast is celebrated for seven days, on account of the honour due to that number, in order that
 nothing which tends to cheerfulness and to the giving of thanks to God may be separated from the
 holy number seven. (157) And of the seven days, Moses pronounces two, the first and the last,
 holy; giving, as is natural, a preeminence to the beginning and to the end; and wishing, as if in the
 case of a musical instrument, to unite the two extremities in harmony. (158) And the unleavened
 bread is ordained because their ancestors took unleavened bread with them when they went forth
 out of Egypt, under the guidance of the Deity; or else, because at that time (I mean at the spring
 season, during hich this festival is celebrated) the crop of wheat is not yet ripe, the plains being still
 loaded with the corn, and it not being as yet the harvest time, and therefore lawgiver has ordained
 the use of unleavened food with a view to assimilating it to the state of the crops. For unleavened
 food is also imperfect or unripe, as a memorial of the good hope which is entertained; since nature
 is by this time preparing her annual gifts for the race of mankind, with an abundance and plenteous
 pouring forth of necessaries. (159) The interpreters of the holy scriptures do also say that the
 unleavened food is a gift of nature, but that barmed bread is a work of art. (160) Since, therefore,
 the vernal festival is a commemoration of the creation of the world, and since that it was inevitable
 that the most ancient persons, those formed out of the earth, must have used the gifts of the world
 without alteration, pleasure not having as yet obtained the dominion, the lawgiver ordained that
 food which was the most suitable to the occasion, wishing to kindle every year a desire to walk in
 the paths of a holy and rigid way of Life.{19}{section 161 was omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition
 on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked this material. These lines have been newly translated for this
 volume.} (161) The setting out of twelve loaves--the same number as the tribes--on the sacred
 table especially guarantees the things which have been said. For they are all unleavened, the
 clearest example of an unmixed food which has been prepared not by human skill for pleasure but
 by nature for the most essential use. These things are sufficient for this topic.
<p>
<p>                           THE SIXTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXIX. (162) There is also a festival on the day of the paschal feast, which succeeds the first day,
 and this is named the sheaf, from what takes place on it; for the sheaf is brought to the altar as a
 first fruit both of the country which the nation has received for its own, and also of the whole land;
 so as to be an offering both for the nation separately, and also a common one for the whole race
 of mankind; and so that the people by it worship the living God, both for themselves and for all the
 rest of mankind, because they have received the fertile earth for their inheritance; for in the
 country there is no barren soil but even all those parts which appear to be stony and rugged are
 surrounded with soft veins of great depth, which, by reason of their richness, are very well suited
 for the production of living Things.{20}{sections 163174 were omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition
 on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked this material. These lines have been newly translated for this
 volume.} (163) The reason is that a priest has the same relation to a city that the nation of the Jews
 has to the entire inhabited world. For it serves as a priest--to state the truth--through the use of all
 purificatory offerings and the guidance both for body and soul of divine laws which have checked
 the pleasures of the stomach and those under the stomach and [tamed] the mob [of the
 Senses]{21}{there is a clear problem with the text here, i.e., the noun ochlon lacks a verb.} by having appointed
 reason as charioteer over the irrational senses; they also have driven back and overturned the
 undiscriminating and excessive urges of the soul, some by rather gentle instructions and
 philosophical exhortations, others by rather weighty and forcible rebukes and by fear of
 punishment, the fear which they brandish threateningly. (164) Apart from the fact that the legislation
 is in a certain way teaching about the priesthood and that the one who lives by the laws is at once
 considered a priest, or rather a high priest, in the judgment of truth, the following point is also
 remarkable. The multitude of gods, both male and female, honored in individual cities happens to
 be undetermined and indefinite. The poetic clan and the great company of humans have spoken
 fabulously about them, people for whom the search for truth is impractical and beyond their
 capability of investigation. Yet all do not reverence and honor the same gods, but different people
 different gods. The reason is that they do not consider as gods those belonging to another land but
 make the acceptance of them the occasion for laughter and a joke. They charge those who honor
 them with great foolishness since they completely violate sound sense. (165) But if he is, whom all
 Greeks together with all barbarians acknowledge with one judgment, the highest Father of both
 gods and humans and the Maker of the entire cosmos, whose nature--although it is invisible and
 unfathomable not only to sight but also to perception--all who spend their time with mathematics
 and other philosophy long to discover, leaving aside none of the things which contribute to the
 discovery and service of him, then it was necessary for all people to cling to him and not as if
 through some mechanical device to introduce other gods into participation of equal honors. (166)
 Since they slipped in the most essential matter, the nation of the Jews--to speak most
 accurately--set aright the false step of others by having looked beyond everything which has come
 into existence through creation since it is generate and corruptible in nature, and chose only the
 service of the ungenerate and eternal. The first reason for this is because it is excellent; the
 second is because it is profitable to be dedicated and associated with the Older rather than those
 who are younger and with the Ruler rather than those who are ruled and with the Maker rather
 those things which come into existence. (167) For this reason it amazes me that some dare to
 charge the nation with an anti-social stance, a nation which has made such an extensive use of
 fellowship and goodwill toward all people everywhere that they offer up prayers and feasts and first
 fruits on behalf of the common race of human beings and serve the really self-existent God both
 on behalf of themselves and of others who have run from the services which they should have
 rendered. (168) These are the things they do for the entire race of human beings. On the other
 hand they give thanks for themselves for many things. The first is that they are not perpetually
 wandering here and there among islands and continents and like foreigners and those without a
 permanent abode who have settled the lands of others and occupy others' wealth are reproached
 since they have acquired no portion of land from lack of means, but have acquired a land and
 cities and for a long time have been in possession of their own inheritance, for which reason it has
 been a sacred duty for them to offer the first fruits. (169) The second is that they did not receive a
 worthless and common land, but a good and fertile land both for the breeding of domestic animals
 and the abundance of unspeakably great crops. For there is no poor soil in it, and even the parts
 that seem to be stony and hardened are broken up with soft and especially deep veins which
 because of their richness are good for crop production. (170) In addition to these things, they did
 not receive a desolate land, but one in which there was a populous nation and great cities
 abounding in men. Yet the cities were emptied of their inhabitants and the entire race disappeared
 except for a small part: some as a result of wars and others as a result of divinely sent attacks
 because of their new and strange practices of wrongs and all of the impieties they used to commit
 through their great efforts to demolish the laws of nature. These things happened so that those
 who replaced them might be sobered by the calamities of others, and learn from their deeds that
 those who become devotees of evil deeds will suffer the same fate but those who have honored a
 life of virtue will possess their assigned portion, numbered not among emigrants but among the
 native residents. (171) That the first fruit is a handful for their own land and for all lands, offered in
 thanksgiving for prosperity and a good season which the nation and the entire race of human
 beings were hoping to enjoy, has been demonstrated. We should not be unaware that many
 benefits have come by means of the first fruit: first, memory of God--it is not possible to find a
 more perfect good than this; then, the most just recompense to the real Cause of the fruitfulness.
 (172) For the things which occur as a result of agricultural skill are few or none at all: to build up
 furrows, to dig and spade all around a plant, to deepen a trench, to cut off excessive growths, or to
 perform any similar task. But the things which come from nature are all essential and useful: the
 most fertile ground, a land well-watered by springs and both spring-fed and seasonal rivers and
 sprinkled with annual rains, mild temperatures of air moved by breezes which are most conducive
 for life, countless types of crops and plants. For which of these has a human either discovered or
 engendered? (173) Nature which has engendered these things has not begrudged a man its own
 goods, but considered him to be the governing part of mortal animals because he has a share in
 reason and good sense. She therefore chose him on the basis of his merit and summoned him to
 participate in her own goods. For these things it is right that the host, God, be praised and admired
 since he sees to it that the truely hospitable earth, all of it, is always full of not only the necessities
 but even of the things which make for a luxurious life. (174) In addition to these things, we should
 not fail to pay our regard to benefactors. For the person who is thankful to God who needs nothing
 and is selfsufficient, will also make it a habit to be thankful to humans who are in need of how many
 countless things. And there are many meanings intended by this offering of the first fruits. In the
 first place they are a memorial of God; secondly, they are a most just requital to be offered to him
 who is the real cause of all fertility; (175) and the sheaf of the first fruits is barley, calculated for the
 innocent and blameless use of the inferior animals; for since it is not consistent with holiness to
 offer first fruits of everything, since most things are made rather for pleasure than for any actually
 indispensable use, it is also not consistent with holiness to enjoy and partake of any thing which is
 given for food, without first giving thanks to that being to whom it is becoming and pious to offer
 them. That portion of the food which was honoured with the second place, namely, barley, was
 ordered by the law to be offered as first fruits; for the first honours were assigned to wheat, of
 which it has deferred the offering of the first fruits, as being more honourable, to a more suitable
 season.
<p>
<p>                         THE SEVENTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXX. (176) The solemn assembly on the occasion of the festival of the sheaf having such great
 privileges, is the prelude to another festival of still greater importance; for from this day the fiftieth
 day is reckoned, making up the sacred number of seven sevens, with the addition of a unit as a
 seal to the whole; and this festival, being that of the first fruits of the corn, has derived its name of
 pentecost from the number of fifty, (pentekostos). And on it it is the custom to offer up two
 leavened loaves made of wheat, as a first fruit of the best kind of food made of corn; either
 because, before the fruit of the year is converted to the use of man, the first produce of the new
 crop, the first gathered corn that appears is offered as a first fruit, in order that by an insignificant
 emblem the people may display their grateful disposition; {22}{sections 177180 were omitted in Yonge's
 translation because the edition on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked this material. These lines have
 been newly translated for this volume.} (177) We must disclose another reason. Its nature is wondrous
 and highly prized for numerous reasons including the fact that it consists of the most elemental and
 oldest of the things which are encased in substances, as the mathematicians tell us, the
 rightangled triangle. For its sides, which exist in lengths of three and four and five, combine to
 make up the sum twelve, the pattern of the zodiac cycle, the doubling of the most fecund number
 six which is the beginning of perfection since it is the sum of the same numbers of which it is also
 the Product.{23}{literally, "being the sum of its own parts to which it is equal." In mathematical notation: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 =
 1 x 2 x 3.} To the second power, it seems, they produce fifty, through the addition of 3 x 3 and 4 x 4
 and 5 x 5. The result is that it is necessary to say that to the same degree that fifty is better than
 twelve, the second power is better than the first power. (178) If the image of the lesser is the most
 beautiful sphere of those which are in heaven, the zodiac, then of what would the better, the
 number fifty, be a pattern than a completely better nature? This is not the occasion to speak about
 this. It is sufficient for the present that the difference has been noted so that a principal point is not
 considered to be subordinate. (179)the feast which takes place on the basis of the number fifty
 has received the name "the feast of the first produce" since during the feast it is customary to
 offer two leavened loaves made from wheat as the first fruit of grain, the best food. It is named "the
 feast of the first produce" Either{24}{the "or" is in section 181.} because before the annual crop has
 proceeded to human use, the first produce of the new grain and the first fruit which has appeared
 are offered as first fruit. (180) For it is just and religiously correct that those who have received the
 greatest gift from God, the abundance of the most necessary as well as most beneficial and even
 the sweetest food, should not enjoy it or have any use of it at all before they offer the first fruits to
 the Supplier. They are giving him nothing since all things and possessions and gifts are his, but
 through a small symbol demonstrate a thankful and God-loving character to the one who needs no
 favors but showers continuous and ever-flowing favors. (181) Or else because the fruit of wheat is
 most especially the first and most excellent of all productions. (182) And the bread is leavened
 because the law forbids any one to offer unleavened bread upon the altar; not in order that there
 should be any contradiction in the injunctions given, but that in a manner the giving and receiving
 may be of one sort; the receiving being gratitude from those who offer it, and the giving an
 unhesitating bestowal of the customary blessings on those who offer. [...]{25}{the whole of this passage
 appears corrupt and unintelligible. Mangey especially points out that what was forbidden was not to offer unleavened
 bread, but leavened bread upon the altar. See Exodus 28.23:18.} Not indeed to that [...]{26}{part of section 183 was
 omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked this material.
 These lines have been newly translated for this volume.} (183) For those for whom it is lawful and permissible
 will use what has once been consecrated; and it is lawful for those who are consecrated to the
 priesthood, who have received the right given by the humaneness of the law to share in the things
 offered on the altar which are not consumed by the unquenchable fire, either as a wage for their
 services or as a prize for contests in which they compete on behalf of piety or as a sacred
 allotment in view of the fact that with regard to the land they have not acquired their appropriate
 part in the same way as the other tribes. (184) And it is permitted to the priests; and the leaven is
 also an emblem of two others things; first of all of that most perfect and entire food, than which one
 cannot, among all the things of daily use, find any which is better and more advantageous; and the
 fruit of wheat is the best of all the things that are sown; so that it is fitting, that that should be
 offered as the most excellent of first fruits, for the most excellent gift. (185) The second is a more
 figurative meaning, implying that every thing which is leavened is apt to inflate and elate; and joy is
 an irrational elation of the soul. Now man is not by nature disposed to rejoice at anything that exists
 more than at an abundant and sufficient supply of necessaries; for which it is very proper to give
 thanks joyfully, making a display of gratitude, for the invisible happiness affecting the mind, which
 shall be perceptible to the outward senses through the medium of the leavened loaves; (186) and
 these first fruits are loaves, not corn, because when there is corn there is no longer anything
 wanting for the enjoyment of food, for it is said that the wheat is the last of all the grains which are
 sown to ripen and to come to harvest. (187) And there are thus two most excellent acts of
 thanksgiving having a reference to two distinct times; to the past, in which we have been saved
 from experiencing the evils of scarcity and hunger while living in happiness and plenty; and to the
 future, because we have provided ourselves with supplies and abundant preparations for it.
<p>
<p>                          THE EIGHTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXXI. (188) Immediately after comes the festival of the sacred moon; in which it is the custom to
 play the trumpet in the temple at the same moment that the sacrifices are offered. From which
 practice this is called the true feast of trumpets, and there are two reasons for it, one peculiar to
 the nation, and the other common to all mankind. Peculiar to the nation, as being a commemoration
 of that most marvellous, wonderful, and miraculous event that took place when the holy oracles of
 the law were given; (189) for then the voice of a trumpet sounded from heaven, which it is natural
 to suppose reached to the very extremities of the universe, so that so wondrous a sound attracted
 all who were present, making them consider, as it is probable, that such mighty events were signs
 betokening some great things to be accomplished. (190) And what more great or more beneficial
 thing could come to men than laws affecting the whole race? And what was common to all mankind
 was this: the trumpet is the instrument of war, sounding both when commanding the charge and the
 retreat. ... There is also another kind of war, ordained of God, when nature is at variance with itself,
 its different parts attacking one another. (191) And by both these kinds of war the things on earth
 are injured. They are injured by the enemies, by the cutting down of trees, and by conflagrations;
 and also by natural injuries, such as droughts, heavy rains, lightning from heaven, snow and cold;
 the usual harmony of the seasons of the year being transformed into a want of all concord. (192)
 On this account it is that the law has given this festival the name of a warlike instrument, in order to
 show the proper gratitude to God as the giver of peace, who has abolished all seditions in cities,
 and in all parts of the universe, and has produced plenty and prosperity, not allowing a single spark
 that could tend to the destruction of the crops to be kindled into flame.
<p>
<p>                           THE NINTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXXII. (193) And after the feast of trumpets the solemnity of the fast is celebrated, {27}{part of sections
 193194 was omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey, lacked
 this material. These lines have been newly translated for this volume.} Perhaps some of those who are
 perversely minded and are not ashamed to censure excellent things will say, "What sort of a feast
 is this where there is no eating and drinking, no troupe of entertainers or audience, no copious
 supply of strong drink nor the generous display of a public banquet, nor moreover the merriment
 and revelry of dancing to the sound of flute and harp, and timbrels and cymbals, and the other
 instruments of music which awaken the unruly lusts through the channel of the ears? (194) For it is
 in these and through these, it seems, that they think good cheer consists. They do this in ignorance
 of the true good cheer which the all-wise Moses saw with the most sharpsighted eyes and so
 proclaimed the fast a feast and named it the greatest of feasts in our ancestral language, "a
 Sabbath of Sabbaths," or as the Greeks would say, a seven of sevens and a holier than things
 holy. He did this for many reasons. (195) The first reason is the temperance which the lawgiver is
 continually exhorting men to display at all times, both in their language and in their appetites, both in
 and below the belly. And he most especially enjoins them to display it now, when he devotes a day
 to the particular observances of it. For when a person has once learnt to be indifferent to meat and
 drink, those very necessary things, what can there be of things which are superfluous that he would
 find any difficulty in disregarding? (196) The second reason is, that every one is at this time
 occupied in prayers and supplications, and since they all devote their entire leisure to nothing else
 from morning till evening, except to most acceptable prayers by which they endeavour to gain the
 favour of God, entreating pardon for their sins and hoping for his mercy, not for their own merits
 but through the compassionate nature of that Being who will have forgiveness rather than
 punishment. (197) The third is an account of the time at which this fast is fixed to take place; for by
 this season all the fruits which the earth has produced during the whole year are gathered in. And
 therefore to proceed at once to devour what has been produced Moses looked upon as an act of
 greediness; but to fast, and to abstain from touching food, he considered a mark of perfect piety
 which teaches the mind not to trust to the food which it may have prepared as the cause of health
 or life. (198) Therefore those who, after the gathering in of the harvest, abstain from the food, do
 almost declare in express words, "We have with joy received, and we shall cheerfully store up the
 bounteous gifts of nature; but we do not ascribe to any corruptible thing the cause of our own
 durable existence, but we attribute that to the Saviour, to the God who rules in the world, and who is
 able, either by means of these things or without them, to nourish and to preserve Us.{28}{part of
 sections 199200 was omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which Yonge based his translation, Mangey,
 lacked this material. These lines have been newly translated for this volume.} (199) At all events, behold, he
 nourished our forefathers even in the desert for forty Years.{29}{#de 8:2.} How he opened
 fountains to give them abundant drink; and how he rained food from heaven sufficient for each day
 so that they might consume what they needed, and rather than hording or bartering or taking
 thought of the bounties received, they might rather reverence and worship the bountiful Giver and
 honour him with hymns and benedictions such as are due him." (200) The day of the fast is always
 celebrated on the tenth day of the month by order of the law. Why is it on the tenth? As we have
 specified in our treatments of it, {30}{this is probably a reference to the tractate Concerning Numbers mentioned in
 QG 4.110 and Mos. 2.115.} it is named complete perfection by wise Men{31}{panteleia is a Pythagorean name
 for the number ten.} and encompasses all the proportions, the arithmetical and the harmonic and the
 geometric, and in addition the harmonies: the 4:3 ratio through four notes, the 3:2 ratio through five
 notes, the 2:1 ratio through the octave, the 4:1 ratio through the double octave, and it also has the
 9:8 ratio so that it is the most perfect summation of musical theories. From this fact it is named
 complete Perfection.{32}{the text literally says: "the 11/3 through four, the 11/2 through five, the doubled through the
 octave, the quadrupled through the double octave, and it also has the 11/8 ratio ..." Philo has a fuller statement in Opif. 48.
 In each instance he is following the Pythagoreans who applied number theory to music. For similar treatments see
 Plutarch, Moralia 1139D (Mus. 23) and Sextus Empiricus Adv. Math. 7.9495.} (201) Therefore God has
 ordained that abstinence from food should take place in accordance with the perfect number, for
 the sake of affording the best nourishment to the best thing which is in us; that no one may
 suppose that the interpreter of God's word is enjoining hunger, the most intolerable of all evils, but
 only a brief cutting off of the stream which flows into the channels of the body. (202) For thus the
 clear stream which proceeds from the fountain of reason was likely to be borne smoothly and
 evenly to the soul, since the uninterrupted use of food inundating the body contributes also to
 confuse the reason. But if the supply of food be checked, then the reason getting a firm footing as
 in a dry road, will be able to proceed in safety without stumbling; (203) and besides it was fitting that
 when the supply of all things had turned out according to the wishes of the people and become
 completed, they should, amid the abundance of their harvest, preserve a commemoration of their
 previous want by abstinence from food, and should offer up prayers, in order that they might never
 come to a real experience of a want of necessary food.
<p>
<p>                           THE TENTH FESTIVAL
<p>
 XXXIII. (204) The last of all the annual festivals is that which is called the feast of tabernacles,
 which is fixed for the season of the autumnal equinox. And by this festival the lawgiver teaches two
 lessons, both that it is necessary to honour equality, the first principle and beginning of justice, the
 principle akin to unshadowed light; and that it is becoming also, after witnessing the perfection of all
 the fruits of the year, to give thanks to that Being who has made them perfect. (205) For the
 autumn (metoporon), as its very name shows is the season which comes after (meta) the fruits
 of the year (ten oporan) are now gathered into the granaries, on account of the providence of
 nature which loves the living creatures upon the earth. (206) And, indeed, the people are
 commanded to pass the whole period of the feast under tents, either because there is no longer
 any necessity for remaining in the open air labouring at the cultivation of the land, since there is
 nothing left in the land, but all ... is stored up in the barns, on account of the injuries which otherwise
 might be likely to visit it from the burning of the sun or the violence of the Rains.{33}{portions of sections
 207, 209, 212, 213 were omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which Yonge based his translation,
 Mangey, lacked this material. These lines have been newly translated for this volume.} (207) For when the crops
 which provide nourishment are in the fields, you act as a manager and guard of those necessities
 not by having cooped yourself up like a woman who belongs at home, but by having gone out to the
 fields. If severe cold or summer heat befalls you as you live in the open air, the overgrowths of the
 trees are handy shelters. If you get under their protection, you will be able to escape easily the
 harm from each. But when all the crops are in, go in with them to look for a more substantial abode
 for rest in place of the toils which you endured as you worked the land. Or again, it may be a
 reminder of the long journey of our ancestors which they made through a wide desert, living in tents
 for many years at each station. (208) And it is proper in the time of riches to remember one's
 poverty, and in an hour of glory to recollect the days of one's disgrace, and at a season of peace
 to think upon the dangers that are past. (209) In addition to the pleasure it provides, a not
 inconsiderable advantage for the practice of virtue comes from this. For people who have had
 prosperity and adversity before their eyes and have pushed the latter away and are enjoying the
 free use of the better, of necessity become thankful in disposition and are being urged on to piety
 by fear of a change of state to the contrary condition. As a result they honor God in songs and
 words for their present wealth and persistently entreat and conciliate him with supplications that
 they will no longer be tested with calamities. (210) Again, the beginning of this festival is appointed
 for the fifteenth day of the month, on account of the reason which has already been mentioned
 respecting the spring season, also that the world may be full, not by day only but also by night, of
 the most beautiful light, the sun and moon on their rising opposite to one another with uninterrupted
 light, without any darkness interposing itself between so as to divide them. (211) And after the
 festival has lasted seven days, he adds an eighth as a seal, calling it a kind of crowning feast, not
 only as it would seem to this festival, but also to all the feasts of the year which we have
 enumerated; for it is the last feast of the year, and is a very stable and holy sort of conclusion,
 befitting men who have now received all the produce from the land, and who are no longer in
 perplexity and apprehension respecting any barrenness or scarcity. (212) Perhaps, however, the
 first cubic number, the number eight, was assigned to the feast for the following reason. It is in its
 Capacity{34}{the term dynamei is problematic here. It normally means "squared"--as Colson recognized--but is here
 understood more generally.} the beginning of solid substance at the transition from the incorporeal, the
 end of the intelligible. The intelligible [make the Transition]{35}{there is no verb in the text. The translation
 follows one of Cohn's conjectures [metabainei] which matches metabasin nicely.} to a solid nature through the
 scale of ascending powers. (213) And in fact, the autumnal feast, just as I said, as a kind of
 summation and end of all the feasts in the year seems to be more stable and steadier since people
 have already received the revenue from the land and are no longer in a state of fear and baffled by
 doubts about productivity or dearth. For the anxious thoughts of farmers are not settled until the
 crops are in because of the losses just waiting to happen from so many people and animals. (214)
 I have spoken in this way about the sacred week and the sacred number seven at more than usual
 length, wishing to show that all the feasts of the year are, as it were, the offspring of the number
 seven, which stands in the relation of a mother. [...]{36}{I have translated this as it is printed in Schwichest's
 edition. Mangey makes the treatise end at "mother."} Follies and joys; and because in such assemblies and
 in a cheerful course of life there are thus established seasons of delight unconnected with any
 sorrow or depression supporting both the body and the soul; the one by the pleasure and the other
 by the opportunities for philosophical study which they Afford.{37}{yonge's translation includes a separate
 treatise title at this point: On the Festival of the Basket of First-Fruits and notes that it is not given in Mangey's edition.
 Accordingly, his next paragraph begins with roman numeral I (= XXXIV in the Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes with
 number IV (= Loeb XXXVII). The publisher has elected to follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 XXXIV. (215) There is, besides all these, another Festival{38}{#de 26:1.} sacred to God, and a
 solemn assembly on the day of the festival which they call castallus, {39}{castallus is interpreted "a basket
 with a pointed bottom."} from the event that takes place in it, as we shall show presently. Now that this
 festival is not in the same rank, nor of the same importance with the other festivals, is plain from
 many considerations. For, first of all, it is not one to be observed by the whole population of the
 nation as each of the others is. Secondly, none of the things that are brought or offered are laid
 upon the altar as holy, or committed to the unextinguishable and holy fire. Thirdly, the very number
 of days which are to be observed in the festival are not expressly stated.
<p>
 XXXV. (216) Nevertheless, any one may easily see that it has about it some of the characteristics
 of a sacred festival, and that it comes very near to having the privileges of a solemn assembly. For
 every one of those men who had lands and possessions, having filled vessels with every different
 species of fruit borne by fruit-bearing trees; which vessels, as I have said before, are called
 castalli, brings with great joy the first fruits of his abundant crop into the temple, and standing in
 front of the altar gives the basket to the priest, uttering at the same time the very beautiful and
 admirable hymn prescribed for the occasion; and if he does not happen to remember it, he listens
 to it with all attention while the priest recites it. (217) And the hymn is as follows:--"The leaders of
 our nation renounced Syria, and migrated to Egypt. Being but few in number, they increased till they
 became a populous nation. Their descendants being oppressed in innumerable ways by the
 natives of the land, when no assistance did any longer appear to be expected from men, became
 the supplicants of God, having fled for refuge to entreat his assistance. (218) Therefore he, who is
 merciful to all who are unjustly treated, having received their supplication, smote those who
 oppressed them with signs and wonders, and prodigies, and with all the marvellous works which he
 wrought at that time. And he delivered those who were being insulted and enduring every kind of
 perfidious oppression, not only leading them forth to freedom, but even giving them in addition a
 most fertile land; (219) for it is from the fruits of this land, O bounteous God! that we now bring you
 the first fruits; if indeed it is a proper expression to say that he who receives them from you brings
 them to you. For, O Master! they are all your favours and your gifts, of which you have thought us
 worthy, and so enabled us to live comfortably and to rejoice in unexpected blessings which thou
 hast given to us, who did not expect them."
<p>
 XXXVI. (220) This hymn is sung from the beginning of summer to the end of autumn, by two
 choruses replying to one another uninterruptedly, on two separate occasions, each at the end of
 one complete half of ten years; because men cannot all at once bring the fruits of the seasons to
 God in accordance with his express command, but different men bring them at different seasons;
 and sometimes even the same persons bring first fruits from the same lands at different times;
 (221) for since some fruits become ripe more speedily, and others more slowly, either on account
 of the differences of the situations in which they are grown, as being hotter or colder, or from
 innumerable other reasons, it follows that the time for offering the first fruits of such productions is
 undefined and uncertain, being extended over a great space. (222) And the use of these first fruits
 is permitted to the priests, since they had no portion of the land themselves, and had no
 possessions from which they could derive revenue; but their inheritance is the first fruits from all
 the nation as the wages of their holy ministrations, which they perform day and night.
<p>
 XXXVII. (223) I have now said thus much respecting the number seven, and the things referring to
 it among the days, and the months, and the years; and about the festivals which are connected with
 this number seven, following the regular connection of the heads of the subject, which I proposed
 to myself according to the order in which they are mentioned in the sacred history. And I shall now
 proceed in regular order to consider the commandment which comes next, which is entitled the one
 about the honour due to Parents.{40}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: On the
 Honour Commanded To Be Paid to Parents. Accordingly, his next paragraph begins with roman numeral I (= XXXVIII in the
 Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes with number XI (= XLVIII in the Loeb). The publisher has elected to follow the Loeb
 numbering.}
<p>
 XXXVIII. (224) Having already spoken of four commandments which, both as to the order in which
 they are placed and as to their importance, are truly the first; namely, the commandment about the
 lenity of that sovereign authority by which the world is governed, and that which commands that
 man should not look upon any representation or figure of anything as God, and that which forbids
 the swearing falsely, or indeed the swearing carelessly and vainly at all, and that concerning the
 sacred seventh day--all which commandments tend to piety and holiness. I now proceed to the
 fifth commandment, relating to the honour due to parents; which is, as I showed in the mention I
 made of it separately before, on the borders between those which relate to the affairs of men and
 those which relate to God. (225) For parents themselves are something between divine and human
 nature, partaking of both; of human nature, inasmuch as it is plain that they have been born and
 that they will die; and of divine nature, because they have engendered other beings, and have
 brought what did not exist into existence: for, in my opinion, what God is to the world, that parents
 are to their children; since, just as God gave existence to that which had no existence, they also, in
 imitation of his power, as far at least as they were able, make the race of mankind everlasting.
<p>
 XXXIX. (226) And this is not the only reason why a man's father and mother are deserving of
 honour, but here are also several other reasons. For among all those nations who have any regard
 for virtue, the older men are esteemed above the younger, and teachers above their pupils, and
 benefactors above those who have received kindnesses from them, and rulers above their
 subjects, and masters above their slaves. (227) Accordingly, parents are placed in the higher and
 superior class; for they are the elders, and the teachers, and the benefactors, and the rulers, and
 the masters. And sons and daughters are placed in the inferior class; for they are the younger, and
 the pupils, and the persons who have received kindnesses, and subjects, and slaves. And that
 every one of these assertions is correct is plain from the circumstances that take place, and
 proofs derived from reason will establish the truth of them yet more undeniably.
<p>
 XL. (228) I affirm, therefore, that that which produces is always older than that which is produced,
 and that that which causes anything is older than that of which it is the cause; but those who beget
 or bring forth a child are in some sense the causes and producers of the child which is begotten or
 brought forth, and they stand in the light of teachers, inasmuch as all that they know themselves
 they teach to their children from their earliest infancy, and they not only exercise and train them in
 the supernumerary accomplishments, impressing reasonings on the minds of their children when
 they come to their prime, but they also teach them those most necessary lessons which refer to
 choice and avoidance, the choice, that is to say, of virtues, and the avoidance of vices, and of all
 the energies in accordance with them. (229) For who can be more completely the benefactors of
 their children than parents, who have not only caused them to exist, but have afterwards thought
 them worthy of food, and after that again of education both in body and soul, and have enabled
 them not only to live, but also to live well; (230) training their body by gymnastic and athletic rules so
 as to bring it into a vigorous and healthy state, and giving it an easy way of standing and moving not
 without elegance and becoming grace, and educating the soul by letters, and numbers, and
 geometry, and music, and every kind of philosophy which may elevate the mind which is lodged in
 the mortal body and conduct it up to heaven, and can display to advantage the blessed and happy
 qualities that are in it, producing an admiration of and a desire for an unchangeable and
 harmonious system, which they will afterwards never leave if they preserve their obedience to their
 captain. (231) And in addition to the benefits which they heap upon them, they have likewise
 authority over the children of whom they are the parents, not as is the case in cities, in
 consequence of some drawing of lots or election, so that any one can find fault with his governor
 as having become so either by some blunder of fortune and not by reason, or it may be by the
 impetuosity of the multitude, the most inconsiderate and foolish of all things, but being established
 in this post by the most excellent and perfect wisdom of the sublime nature, which regulates all
 divine and human affairs in accordance with justice.
<p>
 XLI. (232) For these reasons it is allowable for parents even to accuse their children, and to
 reprove them with considerable severity, and even, if they do not submit to the threats which are
 uttered to them by word of mouth, to beat them, and inflict personal punishment on them, and to
 imprison them; and if they behave with obstinacy and resist this treatment, becoming stiff-necked
 through the greatness of their incurable wickedness, the law permits them to chastise them even to
 the extent of putting them to Death.{41}{#de 21:18.} But still this permission is not given to
 either the father by himself, or to the mother by herself, by reason of the greatness of the
 punishment, which it is not fitting should be determined by one, but by both together, for it is not
 probable that both the parents will agree about putting their child to death unless his iniquities are
 very grievous, and weigh down by a certain undoubted preponderance that firm affection which is
 firmly implanted in the parents by nature. (233) But parents have received not only the power of a
 ruler and governor over their children, but also that of a master, according to both the very highest
 characteristics of the possession of servants, namely, possessing them as born in the house, and
 also as purchased with money, for they expend a price many times greater than their real value on
 their children and for the sake of their children, in wages to nurses, and instructors, and teachers,
 besides all the expenses which they incur for their dress and their food, and their other care of
 them when well and when sick, from their earliest infancy till the time that they are full grown. And
 not only are those looked upon as servants born in the house who have actually been brought forth
 within the walls, but those also are so regarded who by the laws of nature receive from the masters
 of the house a sufficient support to maintain them in life after they are born.
<p>
 XLII. (234) Since this, then, is the case, those who do honour their parents are not doing anything
 worthy of praise, since even any single one of the commandments already mentioned is sufficient
 to invite them to regard their parents with reverence. But are not those men worthy of blame, and
 accusation, and the very extremity of punishment, who neither respect them as older than
 themselves, nor listen to them as their teachers, nor think them worthy of any requital as their
 benefactors, nor obey them as their rulers, nor fear them as their masters? (235) Therefore the
 law says, "Honour thy father and thy mother next after God;"{42}{#de 5:16.} assigning to them
 the second place in honour, on the same principle as nature herself has ranked them in her
 decision of their proper place and duties. And you will not honour them more by any line of conduct
 than by endeavouring and appearing to be virtuous persons. As the being such is a seeking of
 virtue without pride and without guile, and appearing such aims at virtue in connection with a good
 reputation and praise from one's associates; (236) for parents, thinking but little of their own
 advantage, think the virtue and excellence of their children the perfection of their own happiness,
 for which reason it is that they are anxious that they should obey the injunctions which are laid upon
 them, and that they should be obedient to all just and beneficial commands; for a father will never
 teach his child anything which is inconsistent with virtue or with truth.
<p>
 XLIII. (237) And any one may conjecture that pious respect is due to parents, not only from what
 has been said above, but also from the manner in which persons behave to those who are of the
 same age with their parents; for the man who shows respect to an old man, or to an old woman,
 who is no relation to him, must appear in some degree to be remembering his own father and
 mother, and, out of this consideration, to be looking upon them as the images of his parents, who
 are the real models. (238) On which account, in the sacred scriptures, it is not only commanded
 that young men should rise up and give the best seats to their elders, but also that they should rise
 up before them when they pass by; {43}{#le 19:32.} showing honour to the grey hairs of old age,
 to which there is a hope that they may come themselves if they now yield precedence to them.
 (239) And this commandment also seems to me to have been enacted with exceeding beauty and
 propriety; for the law says, "Let each man fear his father and his Mother,"{44}{#le 19:3.} enjoining
 fear rather than affection, not as being more advantageous and profitable with reference to the
 present occasion, for the first of these feelings affects foolish persons when they are being
 instructed or reproved, and folly cannot be cured by any other means than fear. But the second
 feeling, namely, affection towards their parents, it is not fitting should be inculcated on children by
 the injunctions of a lawgiver, for nature requires that that should be spontaneous. For it has
 implanted it so deeply from very infancy in the souls of those who are so completely united by
 blood, and by the services done by the parents to the children, that it is always selftaught and
 spontaneous, and has no need of commandments to enforce it. (240) But the law has enjoined
 fear, because children are accustomed to feel an easy indifference. For though parents attend to
 their children with an exceeding violence of affection, providing them with necessary things from all
 quarters, and bestowing all good things upon them, and shrinking from no labour and from no
 danger, being bound to them by love stronger than any oaths, still some persons do not receive
 their affection as if it aimed solely at their good, being full of luxury and arrogance; and coveting a
 luxurious life, and becoming effeminate both in body and soul, permitting them in no respect to
 entertain proper dispositions as through the native powers of their minds, which they are not
 ashamed to overthrow, and to enervate, and to deprive of each separate energy, and so they
 come not to fear their natural correctors, their fathers and mothers yielding to and indulging their
 own private passions and desires. (241) But we must also urge on the parents of such persons
 that they employ more weighty and severe admonitions in order to cure this impetuous obstinacy of
 their children, and we must warn the children to reverence their parents, fearing them as their
 rulers and natural masters; for it is with difficulty even by these considerations that they will be
 brought to hesitate to act unjustly.
<p>
 XLIV. (242) I have now then gone through all the five heads of laws in the first table, and have
 noticed also all the particular points which had any reference to any individual. I must also now
 point out the punishments affixed to the transgression of these laws. (243) Now there is one
 common penalty affixed to them all, namely, death, through which all such offences have a kind of
 relationship to one another. But the causes of this sentence being pronounced in such cases are
 different, and we must begin with the last, the one that relates to parents, since it is in reference to
 this one that the words are still ringing in our ears, "If any one shall beat his father or his mother, let
 him be Stoned."{45}{#ex 21:15.} And very justly, for it is not fit that that man should live who insults
 those who are the causes of his living; (244) but some of the men of high rank, and some of the
 lawgivers, looking rather at the vain opinions of men than at the truth, have softened this
 commandment, and instituted as a penalty, for those who beat their fathers, that their hands should
 be cut off; and for the sake of bearing a good reputation in the eyes of hasty and inconsiderate
 persons, they profess to them that it is becoming, that the parts with which such men have struck
 their parents should be cut off; (245) but it is a piece of folly to be angry with the servants rather
 than with those who are the causes of such folly; for it is not the hands that behave with such
 insolence, but insolent men perform their actions with their hands, and it is the men who must be
 punished, unless indeed it can be called fitting to let men go who have committed murder with the
 sword, and to content one's self with throwing away the sword; and unless, on the contrary, one
 ought not to give honour to those who have shown preeminent valour in war, but to the inanimate
 coats of armour, by means of which they have behaved themselves valiantly; (246) and unless
 again it is reasonable, in the case of those who have gained the victory in the gymnastic games, in
 the stadium, or the double race, or the long straight course, or in the contest of boxing, or in the
 pancratium, to attempt to crown only the legs and arms of the conquerors, and to let the whole of
 their bodies remain unhonoured. Surely it would be a ridiculous thing to lay down such principles as
 these, and to abstain in consequence from punishing or honouring those who were the real causes
 of the results in question; for we do not pass over a man who has given a splendid exhibition of
 musical skill, playing exquisitely on the flute or the lyre, and think the instruments themselves worthy
 of proclamations and honours. (247) Why, then, should we deprive of their hands men who beat
 their fathers, O you most noble lawgivers? Is it that they may for the future be wholly useless for
 any purpose whatever, and that they may exact as a tribute, not once a year but every day, from
 those whom they have treated with iniquity, compelling them to supply them with necessary food, as
 being unable to provide for themselves? For their father is not so wholly hard-hearted as to endure
 to see even a son who has so grievously offended against him dying of hunger, after his anger has
 been blunted by time. (248) And even if he has not laid hands upon his parents, but has only
 spoken ill of those whom he was bound to praise and bless, or if he has in any other manner done
 anything which can tend to bring his parents into disrepute, still let him Die.{46}{#ex 21:16.} For
 since he is a common enemy, and if one may tell the plain truth, he is a public enemy of all men, to
 whom else can he be kind and favourable when he is not so to the authors of his being, by whose
 means he came into this world, and of whom he is a sort of supplement?
<p>
 XLV. (249) Again, let the man who has profaned the sacred seventh day as far as it may have lain
 in his power, be liable to the punishment of death. For, on the contrary, it is proper rather to provide
 whatever is profane, be it a thing or be it a person, with means of purification, in order to induce a
 change for the better, since "envy," as some one has said, "goes forth out of the divine company."
 But to dare to adulterate or to deface the holy coinage is an act which displays an extraordinary
 degree of impiety. (250) In that ancient migration which took place when the people of Israel left
 Egypt, and when the whole multitude was travelling through the pathless wilderness, when the
 seventh day came all those myriads of men which I have described before rested in their tents in
 perfect tranquillity; but one man, and he not one of the most despised or lowest class of the people,
 disregarding the commands which were laid upon the nation, and ridiculing those who attended to
 them, went forth to pick up sticks, but in reality to show his contempt for and violation of the law.
 (251) And he indeed came back bearing with him a faggot in his arm, but the men who remained in
 their tents although inflamed with anger and exasperated by his conduct, nevertheless did not at
 once proceed to very harsh measures against him that day by reason of the holy reverence due to
 the day, but they led him before the ruler of the people, and made known his impious action, and he
 having committed him to prison, after a command had been given to put him to death, gave the man
 up to those who had originally seen him to execute. As therefore, in my opinion, it was not
 permitted to kindle a fire on the seventh day for the reason which I have already mentioned, so
 likewise it was not lawful to collect any fuel for a fire.
<p>
 XLVI. (252) Against those who call God as a witness in favour of assertions which are not true, the
 punishment of death is ordained in the law; {47}{#de 19:19.} and very properly, for even a man
 of moderate respectability will never endure to be cited as a witness, and to have his name
 registered in support of a lie. But it seems to me that he would look upon any one who proposed
 such a thing to him as a thoroughly faithless enemy; (253) on which account we must say this, that
 him, who swears rashly and falsely, calling God to witness an unjust oath, God, although he is
 merciful by nature, will yet never release, inasmuch as he is thoroughly defiled and infamous from
 guilt, even though he may escape punishment at the hands of men. And such a man will never
 entirely escape, for there are innumerable beings looking on, zealots for and keepers of the
 national laws, of rigid justice, prompt to stone such a criminal, and visiting without pity all such as
 work wickedness, unless, indeed, we are prepared to say that a man who acts in such a way as to
 dishonour his father or his mother is worthy of death, but that he who behaves with impiety towards
 a name more glorious than even the respect due to one's parents, is to be borne with as but a
 moderate offender. (254) But the lawgiver of our nation is not so foolish as, after putting to death
 men who are guilty of minor offences, then to treat those who are guilty of heavier crimes with
 mildness, since surely it is a greater iniquity than even to speak disparagingly or to insult one's
 parents, to show a contempt for the sacred name of God by means of perjury. (255) And if even
 he who swears in an unbecoming manner is guilty and blameable, of what punishment is that man
 worthy who denies the one only true and living God and now honours the creature above the
 Creator, and chooses to honour not only the earth and the water, or the air, or the fire, the
 elements of the universe, or again the sun and moon, and the planets and fixed stars, and the
 whole of heaven, and the universal world, but even stocks and stones, which mortal workmen have
 fashioned, and which by them have been shaped into human figures? (256) Therefore, let such a
 man be himself likened to images carved by the hand; for it ought not to be that that man should
 have any soul himself who honours things destitute of soul or life, and especially after he has been
 a disciple of Moses, whom he has often heard announcing to him and under the influence of divine
 inspiration declaring those most sacred and holy admonitions, "Take not the name of any other
 gods into thy soul for a remembrance of them, and utter not their names with thy voice, but keep
 both thy mind and thy speech far from all other interpositions, and turn them wholly to the Father
 and Creator of the universe, that thus thou mayest cherish the most virtuous and godly thoughts
 about his single government, and mayest speak words that are becoming and most profitable both
 to thyself and to those that hear Thee."{48}{#ex 23:13.}
<p>
 XLVII. (257) We have now then mentioned the punishments which are ordained against those who
 neglect the five commandments. But the rewards which are offered to those who keep them, even
 though the law has not set them forth in express words of injunction, are nevertheless figuratively
 intimated. (258) Therefore the fact of not thinking that there are any other gods but the true God,
 nor imagining that things made by the hand of man are gods, and the fact of not committing perjury,
 are things which have no need of any other reward, for the mere fact, in my opinion, of practising
 these virtues is itself a most excellent and most perfect reward. For at what circumstance can a
 lover of truth feel more really delighted than at the devotion of himself to one God, and attending in
 a guileless and pure manner to his service? (259) And when I speak of witnesses, I mean not such
 persons as are slaves to pride, but such as are devoted to an admiration of goodness free from all
 error, by whom the truth is honoured. For wisdom itself is the reward of wisdom; and justice, and
 each of the other virtues, is its own reward. And truth, as being the most beautiful in the whole
 company, and as being the chief of all the holy virtues, is in much greater degree its own
 recompense and reward, affording as it does happiness to all who practise it, and blessings of
 which they cannot be deprived to their children and descendants.
<p>
 XLVIII. (260) Again, those who properly keep the sacred sabbath are benefited in two most
 important particulars, both body and soul; as to their body, by a rest from their continual and
 incessant labours; and as to their soul, by forming most excellent conceptions respecting God as
 the Creator of the universe and the careful protector of all the things and beings which and whom
 he has made. And he made the whole universe in one week. It is plain, therefore, from these things
 that the man who honours the seventh day will himself find honour. (261) In the same way let not
 him who honours his parents dutifully seek for any further advantage, for if he considers the matter
 he will find his reward in his own conduct. Not but what, since this commandment is inferior in
 importance to the first five commandments, which have a more divine character, inasmuch as this
 is concerned with mortal subjects, God has given an inducement to obey this one, saying, "Honour
 thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thy days may be long in the
 Land;"{49}{#ex 20:12.} (262) affixing thus two rewards to this injunction, one being in fact the
 participation in virtue, for "well" means virtue, or at least cannot subsist without virtue; while the
 other is, if one is to say the truth, immortality by length of days, and a life of long duration, which
 thou wilt preserve even in the body living with thy soul, purified with a perfect purification. These
 things have now been discussed at sufficient length. Let us after this, since the opportunity offers,
 consider the commandments in the second table.
