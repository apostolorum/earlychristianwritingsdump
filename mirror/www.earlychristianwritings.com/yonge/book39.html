 ON PROVIDENCE (Fragment II)
<p>
<p>                        From Eusebius, P.E. 8.14.386Ð399
<p>
 These things then are what may be said on the subject of the world having been created. And the
 same man also says a great number of very novel and bold things in his treatise on Providence, on
 the subject of the universe being governed by prudence; first of all putting forward the propositions
 of the atheists, and then proceeding to reply to each of them in regular order. And I will now
 proceed to extract some of the arguments which he adduces, even though they may appear
 somewhat prolix, because they are nevertheless necessary and important, abridging indeed the
 greater portion of them.
<p>
 (1) Now he conducts his argument in this way; these are his words.
<p>
 Do you say then that there is providence in such a vast confusion and disorder of affairs? For, in
 fact, which of the circumstances and occurrences of human life is regulated by any principle or
 order? which of them is not full of all kinds of irregularity and destruction? Are you the only person
 who is ignorant that blessings in complete abundance are heaped upon the most wicked and
 worthless of mankind? such, for instance, as wealth, a high reputation, honour in the eyes of the
 multitude, authority? moreover, health, a good condition of the outward senses, beauty, strength,
 and unimpeded enjoyment of all good things, by means of an abundance of supplies and resources
 and preparations of every kind, and in consequence of the peaceful good fortune and good
 condition of the body? But all the lovers and practisers of wisdom and prudence, and every kind of
 virtue, everyone of them I may almost say, are poor, unknown, inglorious, and in a mean condition.
<p>
 (2) Having said thus much with respect to the outward circumstances of, and a vast number of
 other things affecting, these men, he then immediately proceeds to refute the objections of his
 adversaries by the following arguments.
<p>
 God is not a tyrant who practises cruelty and violence and all the other acts of insolent authority
 like an inexorable master, but he is rather a sovereign invested with a humane and lawful authority,
 and as such he governs all the heaven and the whole world in accordance with justice. (3) And
 there is no form of address with which a king can more appropriately be saluted than the name of
 father; for what, in human relationships, parents are to their children, that also sovereigns are to
 their states, and God towards the world, having adapted these two most beautiful things by the
 unchangeable laws of nature, by an indissoluble union, namely the authority of the leader with the
 anxious care of a relation; (4) for as parents are not wholly indifferent to even ill-behaved children,
 but, having compassion on their unfortunate dispositions, they are careful and anxious for their
 welfare, looking upon it as an act of relentless and irreconcileable enemies to insult and increase
 their misfortunes, but as the part of friends and relations to lighten their disasters: (5) and indeed in
 the excess of their liberality they even give more to such children than to those who have always
 been well conducted, knowing well that to these last their own moderation is at all times an
 abundant resource and means of riches, but that the others have no other hope except in their
 parents, and that if they are disappointed in that they will be destitute of even the necessaries of
 life.
<p>
 (6) So in the same manner, God, how is the father of all rational understanding, takes care of all
 those beings who are endowed with reason, and exercises a providential power for the protection
 even of those who are living in a blameable manner, giving them at the same time opportunity of
 correcting their errors, and nevertheless not violating the dictates of his own merciful nature, of
 which virtue and humanity are the regular attendants, being willing to have their dwelling in the
 God-created world; (7) this one argument now, do thou, O my soul, take to thyself, and store up
 within thyself as a sacred deposit, and this other also as consistent with and in perfect harmony
 with it. Do not ever be so deceived and wander from the truth to such a degree as to think any
 wicked man happy, even though he may be richer than Croesus, and more sharp-sighted than
 Lyceus, and more powerful than Milo of Crotena, and more beautiful than Ganymede,
<p>
 "Whom the immortal gods, for beauty's sake,
<p>
 Did raise up from the vile earth to heaven,
<p>
 To be the cup-bearer of mighty Jove."{1}{homer's Iliad 20.234.}
<p>
 (8) Accordingly, such a man, having shown his own daemon, I mean to say his own mind, to be the
 slave of ten thousand thousand different masters, such as love, appetite, pleasure, fear, pain, folly,
 intemperance, cowardice, injustice, he can never possibly be happy, even if the multitude, being
 utterly misled and deprived of their judgment, were to think him so, being corrupted by a double evil,
 pride and vain opinion, by which souls without ballast must infallibly be tossed about and driven out
 of their course; for these evils, above all others, injure the chief multitude of mankind.
<p>
 (9) If, then, fixing the eyes of the mind steadily upon the truth, you should be inclined to contemplate
 the providence of God as far as the powers of human reason are capable of doing it, then, when
 you have attained to a closer conception of the true and only good, you will laugh at those things
 which belong to men which you for some time admired; for what is worse is always honoured in the
 absence of what is better, as it then usurps its place; but when that which is better appears, then
 that which is worse retires, and is contented with the second prize. (10) Therefore, admiring that
 godlike excellence and beauty, you will by all means perceive that none of the things previously
 mentioned were by themselves thought worthy of the better portion by God. On which account the
 mines of silver and gold are the most worthless portion of the earth, which is altogether and wholly
 unfit for the production of fruits and food; (11) for abundance of riches is not like food, a thing
 without which one cannot live. And the one great and manifest test of all these things is hunger, by
 which it is seen what is in truth really necessary and useful; for a person when oppressed by
 hunger would gladly give all the treasures in the whole world in exchange for a little food; (12) but
 when there is an abundance of necessary things poured out in a plentiful and unlimited supply, and
 flowing over all the cities of the land, then we, the citizens, indulging luxuriously in the good things
 provided by nature, are not contented to stop at them alone, but set up satiated insolence as the
 guide of our lives, and devoting ourselves to the acquisition of silver and gold, and of everything
 else by which we hope to acquire gain, proceed in everything like blind men, no longer exciting the
 eyes of our intellect by reason of our covetousness, so far as to see that riches are but the burden
 of the earth, and are the cause of continual and uninterrupted war instead of peace.
<p>
 (13) Our garments are indeed, as some one of the poets says somewhere, "the flower of the
 sheep;" but with reference to the art displayed in their manufacture, they are the praise of the
 weavers. And if any one is proud of any glory which he may have acquired, being greatly delighted
 at his popularity among worthless people, he should know that he also is worthless, for he delights
 in them. (14) And let such a man pray to receive purification so as to have the disease of his ears
 healed, as it is through his ears that his soul is affected with great diseases. Again: let those men
 who are proud of their personal strength and activity learn not to be high-minded on such an
 account, looking at countless kinds of both domesticated and wild beasts, which are also endowed
 with great strength and power; for it is the most absurd thing imaginable for one who is a man to
 pride himself on the good qualities of beasts, and that too when the beasts themselves are thought
 of no importance whatever by him.
<p>
 (15) Again: why should any man in his senses rejoice at beauty of person, which a short period
 must extinguish before it has flourished for any great length of time, since time always obscures its
 deceitful prime? and this too, when he sees that even in lifeless things there are objects of
 surpassing beauty, such as the works of painters, and sculptors, and other artists, displayed in
 paintings, and statues, and all kinds of embroidery, and weaving, which are held in the greatest
 honour in Greece and in the countries of the barbarians in every city. (16) Of these things, then, as
 I have said, not one is accounted by God worthy of the better portion.
<p>
 And why should we wonder if they are not highly esteemed by God? for they are not even by those
 men who are very religious and devout, among whom those things which are really good and
 virtuous are held in honour, inasmuch as they have a good and well-disposed nature, and have
 improved their natural good qualities by study and practice, of which a genuine true philosophy is
 the maker. (17) But those who have devoted themselves to a bastard kind of philosophy have not
 even imitated physicians who give their attention to the body, the slave of the soul, though
 nevertheless they affirm that they are healing the mistress, that is to say, the soul itself; for then,
 when any such man is sick, even if he be the great king himself, passing over all the colonnades,
 and the men's chambers, and the women's chambers, and the pictures, and the silver and the gold,
 whether in money or in bullion, and the vast treasures of cups and works of embroidery, and all the
 rest of the celebrated ornaments of kings, and the multitude of his servants, and of his friends, or
 relatives, and subjects, and the chief officers who are about his person, and his body-guards, they
 come up to his bedside, paying no attention even to the decorations of his person, and not
 stopping to notice with admiration that his bed is inlaid with previous stones, or that his coverlet is
 of the finest workmanship and the most exquisite embroidery, nor that the fashion of his garments
 is of superlative beauty, but they even pull off the clothes in which he is wrapped, and lay hold of his
 hands, and press his veins, and feel his pulse, and note its beating accurately to see if it is in a
 healthy condition; very often too, they pull up his tunic and feel whether his stomach is too full,
 whether his chest is feverish, whether his heart beats irregularly. And then, when they have
 ascertained the symptoms, they apply the appropriate remedies.
<p>
 (18) And in like manner, it would become philosophers who profess to be versed in the healing
 science as applicable to the soul, which is by nature the dominant part of the man, to despise all
 the things which erroneous opinion raises up as objects of pride, and to penetrate within, and to lay
 their hands upon the intellect itself, to see whether through passion its pulses are of an uneven
 rapidity and moving in an irregular and unnatural manner, and to touch the tongue, and see whether
 it is rough and devoted to evil-speaking, whether it is prostituted to evil purposes and
 unmanageable; also to touch the belly, and see whether it is swollen with the insatiable
 characteristics of desire, and, in short, of any other passions, and diseases, and infirmities, and to
 examine every one of those feelings, if they appear to be in a state of confusion, so that they may
 not be ignorant of what is proper to be applied to the soul with a reference to its cure.
<p>
 (19) But now being lightened up all round by the brilliancy of external things, as being unable to see
 that light which is perceptible only by the intellect, they have passed their whole existence in a state
 of error, not being able to penetrate as far as royal thought, but being with difficulty able to reach
 the outer courts, and admiring those servants who stand at the gates of virtue, wealth, and glory,
 and health, and other kindred circumstances, they fall down in adoration before them. (20) But as it
 would be an extravagance of insanity to take blind men for judges of colour, or deaf men as judges
 of the sounds of music, so it is a most preposterous act to take wicked men as judges of real
 good. For these men are mutilated in the most important parts of themselves, namely, their
 intellect, over which folly has shed a deep darkness. (21) Do we then now wonder if Socrates, and
 such and such a virtuous man, has lived in purity? men who have never once studied any of the
 means of providing themselves with pecuniary resources, and who have never, even when it was
 in their power, condescended to accept great gifts which have been tendered to their acceptance
 by wealthy friends or mighty kings, because they looked upon the acquisition of virtue as the only
 good, the only beautiful thing, and have therefore laboured at that, and disregarded all other good
 things.
<p>
 (22) And who is there who would not disregard spurious good things in comparison of genuine
 ones? But if while they received a mortal body, and were full of liability to all kinds of human
 disasters, and lived among such a number of unjust actions and unrighteous men, of which the
 very number is not easy to compute accurately, they were plotted against by their enemies, why do
 we blame nature when we ought rather to accuse the barbarity of those who thus set upon them?
 (23) For so in like manner, if they had been placed in a pestilential climate, they would inevitably
 have become sick; and wickedness is even more, or at all events not less, destructive than a
 pestilential state of the atmosphere. But as when there is rain the wise man, if he is in the open air,
 must inevitably get wet through, and if the cold north wind blows he must be oppressed by cold and
 shivering, and when summer is at its height he must feel the heat, for it is a law of nature that the
 bodies of men should be simultaneously affected by the changes of the seasons; so also in the
 same way a man who lives in such places,
<p>
 "Where slaughters dire and famines might prevail,
<p>
 And all the ills which thus mankind assail,"
<p>
 must inevitably pay the penalty which such evils inflict upon him.
<p>
 (24) Since in the case of Polycrates at least, in retaliation for the terrible acts of injustice and
 impiety which he committed, there fell upon him great misery in his subsequent life as a terrible
 requital for his previous good fortune. Add to this that he was chastised by a mighty sovereign, and
 was crucified by him, fulfilling the prediction of the oracle: "I knew," said he, "long before I took it
 into my head to go to consult the oracle, that I was anointed by the sun and washed by Jupiter," for
 these enigmatical assertions, expressed in symbolical language having been originally couched in
 unintelligible language, afterwards receive a most manifest confirmation by the events which
 followed them. (25) But it was not only at the end of his existence, but indeed during the whole
 period of his life from its earliest commencement that he was, though without being aware of it,
 making his soul to depend wholly on his body; for as he was always in a state of alarm and
 trepidation, he feared the multitude of enemies who might possibly attack him, being well assured
 that no one in the world was really well affected towards him, but that every one was hostile to him,
 and would turn out implacable enemies if he should be unfortunate.
<p>
 (26) Again, if unsuccessful and yet of neverending precautions those writers who have written the
 history of Sicily are witnesses, for they say that the tyrant of Sicily suspected even his most
 affectionately loved wife; and a proof of this is that he ordered the entrance of his chamber by
 which she was about to have access to him to be strewed with planks, in order that she might
 never come upon him without being observed, but that the noise and tumult made by her stepping
 on these boards might indicate her approach beforehand; and besides this he compelled her to
 come not only without her robe, but even naked in every part, and even in those which ought not to
 be seen by men. And in addition to this he ordered the whole of the flooring along the road to be cut
 in width and depth like a trench made by farmers, out of fear lest anything should be secretly
 concealed so as to plot against him, which would inevitably be detected by the leaps and long steps
 which a person coming along this path would be compelled to take.
<p>
 (27) Of how many miseries, then, was that man full who took all these precautions and practised all
 these contrivances against his own wife, whom he ought to have trusted above all other human
 beings? But he was like those men who scale precipices and climb over abrupt and steep
 mountains for the purpose of attaining to a more accurate comprehension of the natures of things
 in heaven, who at last after they have with great difficulty ascended to some overhanging ridge,
 find themselves unable to advance any further as they are too much exhausted to think of
 attempting the remaining portion of the mountain, and also want courage to descend, being giddy at
 the sight of the chasms and ravines below them; (28) for he, being in love with sovereign power as
 a godlike thing to be desired above all other objects, looked upon it as unsafe either to remain
 where he was or to retreat, for he considered that if he remained where he was innumerable other
 evils would come upon him in rapid and uninterrupted succession, while if he decided on retracing
 his steps his very life would be in danger, as there were enemies around, if not as to their bodies at
 all events in their minds, against him.
<p>
 (29) And he also showed the truth of all this by the treatment to which he exposed a friend of his
 who spoke of the life of a tyrant as one of complete and absolute happiness; for, having invited him
 to a banquet which had been prepared in a most brilliant and costly manner, he ordered a sharp
 sword to be suspended over his head by a very fine thread, and when he, after he had sat down to
 the banquet, on a sudden perceived it, not daring to rise up and quit his place for fear of the tyrant,
 and not being able to enjoy any of the things which were prepared out of fear, he disregarded all
 the abundant and superb luxuries by which he was surrounded, and keeping his neck and his eyes
 turned upwards, sat in the expectation of instant Death.{2}{horace alludes to the story of Damocles, Od. III.
 1.16 (which may be translated)--"Care murders sleep; the man who's learnt to dread / The sword unsafely trembling o'er
 his head, / In vain to court his sad distracted taste / The table groans beneath the varied feast. / Sad Philomel's untutored
 song is vain, / And vain the swelling flute's more laboured strain, / To close his eyes in sleep, the envied lot / Of weary
 peasant in his humbler cot."} (30) And when Dionysius perceived the state in which he as, he said to
 him, "Do you then at last begin to understand the true character of that illustrious and enviable life
 of ours, for this is what it really is if a man chooses to speak of it without flattery or disguise, since
 it contains indeed a great abundance of resources and supplies, but no enjoyment of any real
 blessing; and it causes its possessor incessant fears and irremediable and unavoidable dangers,
 and a disease worse than the most contagious or most fatal sickness, which is continually
 threatening inevitable death. (31) But the inconsiderate multitude, being deceived by the outward
 brilliancy and splendour of the position, are like people who are attracted by showy looking
 courtesans, who, concealing their real deformity under fine clothes and golden ornaments, and
 pencilling their eyes from want of any real beauty, manufacture a spurious beauty in order to lie in
 wait for and catch the beholders.
<p>
 (32) Now men who are placed in situations of great prosperity are full of such unhappiness as this,
 of the greatness of which they themselves are fully aware, and they do not at all keep it to
 themselves, but like men who under compulsion divulge secret things, they often utter the truest
 possible expressions, which are extorted from them by suffering, living in the continual company of
 punishment both present and expected, just like cattle who are being fattened up for sacrifice, for
 they too are treated with the greatest possible attention in order to be fit to be sacrificed by reason
 of their fleshiness and good condition. (33) There are also some men who have suffered
 punishment, and that not concealed, but visible, and notorious for the impiety of the means by
 which they have acquired riches, the names and numbers of whom it would be superfluous to
 enumerate, but it will be sufficient to bring forward one instance as a specimen of the whole.
<p>
 It is said, then, by those who have written the History of the Sacred War in Phocis that as there
 was a law established that any one who was guilty of sacrilege should be either thrown down a
 precipice, or drowned in the sea, or burnt alive, that those men who had pillaged the temple at
 Delphi, by name Philomelus, and Onomarchus, and Phayllus, divided these punishments among
 them, for that the first fell down a rugged and precipitous rock and was dashed to pieces on the
 stones, and that the second, when the horse which he was riding grew restive and plunged down
 towards the sea, was overwhelmed by the waves, and so fell alive into a devouring gulf; and
 Phayllus was wasted away by a consumptive disease (for the way in which the story is told about
 him is twofold), or else perished in the temple at Abae, being burnt in it when it was destroyed by
 fire. (34) For it must be the mere spirit of obstinacy and arguing to say that all these events took
 place by mere chance, for if indeed one or two of them had been punished at different periods or
 by some other mode of punishment, then it would have been reasonable to impute their fate to the
 uncertainty of fortune, but when they all died together and at one time, and by no other punishment
 but by that precise end which is appointed in the laws for the punishment of such crimes as those
 of which they had been guilty, it is surely fair to say that they perished by the direct condemnation
 of God.
<p>
 (35) But if any of the violent men who are unmentioned, and who have at different times risen up
 against the people in their several states, and have enslaved not only other nations, but their own
 countries too, have still died without meeting with punishment, it is not to be wondered at, for in the
 first place man does not judge as God judges, because we investigate what is visible to ourselves,
 but he descends into the secret recesses of the soul without making any noise, and there
 contemplates the mind in the clear light, as if in the sun; for stripping off from it all the ornaments in
 which it is enveloped, and seeing its devices and intentions naked, he immediately distinguishes
 between the bad and the good.
<p>
 (36) Let not us then, preferring our own judgment to that of God, assert that it is more unerring or
 more full of wisdom than his, for that is not consistent with holiness; for in the one there are many
 things which deceive it, such as the treacherous outward senses, the insidious character of the
 passions, the most terrible attacks of vice, but in the other there is nothing which can at all conduce
 to deceit or error, but justice and truth, by which each separate action is determined on, and in this
 way is naturally rectified in the most praiseworthy manner.
<p>
 (37) Do not thou, then, my good friend, consider tyrannical power, that most unprofitable of all
 things, to be a seasonable possession; for neither is punishment disadvantageous, but it is either
 more beneficial, or at all events not injurious to the good to suffer due punishment, on which
 account it is expressly comprehended in all laws which are wisely enacted, and those who have
 established such laws are praised by every one; for what a tyrant is in a people, that is punishment
 in a law.
<p>
 (38) When therefore a want and terrible scarcity of virtue seizes upon cities, and when a great
 abundance of folly overwhelms everything, then God, like the stream of an overflowing torrent,
 being desirous to wash away all the power and impetuosity of wickedness, in order to purify our
 race, gives vigour and power to those men who by their natures are fitted to exercise dominion,
 (39) for without a stern soul wickedness cannot be got rid of. And just as cities keep executioners
 for the punishment of murderers, and traitors, and sacrilegious persons, not because they approve
 of the dispositions of the men, but because they have need of the serviceable part of their
 ministrations; in the same manner the Ruler of this mighty city, the world, appoints tyrants, like
 ordinary executioners, to be over those cities in which he sees that violence, and injustice, and
 impiety prevail, and all other kinds of evils in abundance, that he may by these means put an end to
 their existence. (40) And then he thinks it right to pursue the guilty, as men who have been serving
 these vices from the impulses of an impure and pitiless soul, with every punishment imaginable, as
 the ringleaders; for as the power of fire when it has consumed the fuel which was given to it, at last
 consumes itself also, so also do those who have received supreme power over nations, when they
 have exhausted the cities and rendered them destitute of inhabitants, at last perish themselves
 among them, suffering due punishment for all that they have done.
<p>
 (41) And why should we wonder if God employs the agency of tyrants to get rid of wickedness
 when widely diffused over cities, and countries, and nations? For he very often uses other
 ministers, and himself brings about the same end by his own resources, inflicting upon the nation
 famine, or pestilence, or earthquakes, or any other heaven-sent calamity, by which great and
 numerous multitudes perish every day, and by which a great portion of the habitable world is made
 desolate, on account of his care for the preservation of virtue.
<p>
 (42) Therefore I have now, as I conceive, spoken at sufficient length on the present subject,
 namely, that no wicked man is happy, by which fact above all others it may be established that
 there is such a thing as providence; but if you are not thoroughly convinced, then tell me boldly what
 is the doubt which is still lurking in your mind, for then both of us by labouring together shall be able
 to see clearly what the real truth is. (43) And after some more arguments, he proceeds thus:--
<p>
 God causes the violent storms of wind and rain which we see, not for the injury of those who
 traverse the sea, as you fancied, or of those who till the earth, but for the general benefit of the
 whole of the human race, for with his water he cleanses the earth, and with his breezes he purifies
 all the regions beneath the moon, and by the united influence of both he nourishes and promotes
 the growth and brings to perfection both animals and plants. (44) And if at times these things do
 injure those who put to sea or who till the land at unseasonable moments, it is not to be wondered
 at, for these men are but a small portion of the human race, and the care of God is exerted for the
 benefit of all mankind.
<p>
 As, therefore, in a gymnastic school oil is placed there for the common benefit of every one, but
 still it often happens that the master of the school, by reason of some political necessity changes
 the arrangement of the usual hours of exercise, by which means some of those who wish to anoint
 themselves come too late; in like manner God, who takes care of the whole world as if it were a city
 committed to his charge, does sometimes cause the summer to resemble winter, and winter to
 assume the characteristics of spring, for the common benefit of the universe, even though some
 captains of ships, or some cultivators of the ground, may very likely be injured by this irregularity of
 the seasons. (45) Therefore He, being aware that the occasional interchanges of the elements
 with one another, out of which the world was made, and of which it consists, are a work of the
 greatest importance and necessity, supplies them without allowing anything to be an obstacle to
 them; and frost and snow-storms, and other things of that kind, follow the cooling of the air. And,
 again, lightnings and thunders arise from the collision and repercussion of the clouds, none of
 which things are perhaps effected by any immediate exertion of providence, but the rains and
 winds are the causes of existence, and nourishment, and growth to all things which are upon the
 earth, and these phenomena are the natural consequences of those others.
<p>
 (46) For just as it often happens, when the master of a gymnastic school, out of rivalry, has gone
 to extravagant expense, then some of those who are ignorant of all that is becoming, having been
 bespattered with oil instead of water, let all the drops from them fall upon the boards, and then a
 most slippery mud is the result: nevertheless a man, whose appreciations were just would not say
 that the hard and the slippery state of the ground was caused by the intention of the master of the
 school, but that these things had resulted accidentally, in consequence of the abundant quantity of
 the things supplied. (47) Again, the rainbow, and the halo, and all other things of that kind, are
 natural consequences of those things becoming mingled with the clouds, not being occurrences
 which lead and influence nature, but being the results and consequences of the operations of
 nature.
<p>
 Not but what these very things themselves do also afford some signs of great importance to wise
 men, for, guiding their conjectures by them, they predict calms and storms of wind, and fine
 weather, and tempests. (48) Do you not see that porticoes which embellish the cities? the greater
 part of these look towards the south, in order that those who walk under them may be warm in the
 winter, and may be cool in the summer.
<p>
 There is also another thing which does not happen through the intention of Him who made it, and
 what is this? the shadows which fall from the feet indicate the hours to our experience. (49) And
 again, fire is a most important work of nature, but the consequence of fire is smoke, and
 nevertheless even this too at times is of some service. At all events in the heat, in the middle of the
 day, when the fire is rendered invisible by the brilliancy of the beams of the sun, the approach of
 enemies is indicated by the smoke, (50) and the principle which causes the rainbow is also the
 same which, in some degree, regulates eclipses.
<p>
 For eclipses are a natural consequence of the rules which regulate the divine natures of the sun
 and moon; and they are indications either of the impending death of some king, or of the
 destruction of some city, as Pindar also has told us in enigmatical terms, alluding to such events as
 the consequences of the omens which I have now been Mentioning.{3}{this theory of the eclipses of the
 sun and other natural prodigies being prophetic of events on earth, is expressed by Virgil in a passage of the most
 exquisite beauty in reference to Caesar's death, Georg. 1.462 (as it is translated by Dryden)--"The unerring sun by certain
 signs declares / What the late eve or early morn prepares, / And when the south projects a stormy day, / And when the
 clearing north will puff the clouds away. / The sun reveals the secrets of the sky, / And who dares give the source of light
 the lie? / The change of empires often he declares, / Fierce tumults, hidden treasons, open wars. / He first the fate of
 Caesar did foretell, / And pitied Rome, when Rome in Caesar fell, / In iron clouds concealed the public light, / And
 impious mortals feared eternal night. / Nor was the fact foretold by him alone, / Nature herself stood forth and seconded
 the sun. / Earth, air, and seas with prodigies were signed, / And birds obscene and howling dogs divined; / What rocks did
 Aetna's bellowing mouth expire / From her torn entrails! and what floods of fire. / What clanks were heard in German skies
 afar / Of arms and armies rushing to the war. / Dire earthquakes rent the solid Alps below, / And from their summits shook
 the eternal snow. / Pale spectres in the close of night were seen, / And voices heard of more than mortal men. / In silent
 groves dumb sheep and oxen spoke, / And streams ran backward and their beds forsook; / The yawning earth disclosed
 the abyss of hell, / The weeping statues did the wars foretell, / And holy sweat from brazen idols fell. / Then rising in his
 might, the king of floods / Rushed through the forests, tore the lofty woods, / And rolling onwards, with a sweepy sway /
 Bore houses, lands, and labouring hinds away. / Blood sprang from wells, wolves howled in turns by night, / And boding
 victims did the priests affright. / Such peals of thunder never poured from high, / Nor forky lightnings flashed from such a
 sullen sky; / Red meteors ran across the ethereal space, / Stars disappeared and comets took their place. / For this the
 Emathian plains once more were strewed / With Roman bodies, and just heaven thought good / To fatten twice those
 fields with Roman blood."} (51) And the circle of the Milky Way partakes of the same natural essences
 with the other stars; but merely the fact that it is hard to account for, is no reason that those who
 are accustomed to investigate the principles of nature should shrink from examining into it; for the
 discovery of those things is most beneficial, and the investigation of them is intrinsically most
 delightful for its own sake, to those who are fond of learning.
<p>
 (52) For as the sun and moon exist in consequence of Providence, so also do all things in heaven,
 even though we are unable to trace out accurately the respective natures and powers of each, and
 are, therefore, reduced to silence about them; (53) and earthquakes, and pestilences, and the fall
 of thunderbolts, and things of that kind, are said indeed to be sent by God, but, in reality, they are
 not so, for God is absolutely not the cause of any evil whatever of any kind, but the natural
 changes of the elements produce these effects, not as circumstances which guide nature, but as
 those which are followed by necessary results, and which do themselves follow naturally upon their
 antecedent causes. (54) And if some people, who think themselves entitled to immunity meet with
 some injury from these things, they are still not to find fault with their management and
 dispensation; for, in the first place, it does not follow, that if some persons are reckoned virtuous
 among men, they are so in real truth; since the criteria by which God judges are far more accurate
 than any of the tests by which the human mind is guided. And, in the second place, prophetic
 wisdom loves to contemplate those things in the world which are of the most comprehensive
 nature, as in the case of monarchies, and in the governments of armies, we see that it is not any
 obscure, ignoble, or chance person who is appointed to govern the cities or the armies.
<p>
 (55) And some persons say that as on occasion of the slaying of tyrants, it is lawful that their
 relations also should be put to death, in order that transgressions may be checked by the terrible
 magnitude of the punishment inflicted: in like manner in pestilential diseases, it is necessary that
 some of those who are not guilty should be involved in the destruction, in order that others who are
 at a distance may learn moderation. Besides that, it is inevitable that those who are exposed to a
 pestilential atmosphere must become diseased just as all persons who are exposed to a storm on
 board a ship must be all exposed to equal danger. (56) But those wild beasts which are
 courageous have been created; for we must not suppress the truth (as if one were to anticipate
 the defence likely to be made by a man of powerful eloquence and tare it to pieces beforehand), in
 order that men may, by practising against them, acquire hardihood for the contests of war; for
 gymnastic exercises and continued hunting train men and inure their souls in a greater degree
 even than their bodies to rely upon their own courage, and energy, and strength, so as to disregard
 the sudden attacks of their enemies.
<p>
 (57) But those men who are of peaceable character are at liberty to keep themselves not only
 within their walls, but also even within tents, and there to live in privacy, safe from the designs of
 any enemies, having vast and countless herds of domestic animals to help their enjoyment; since
 boars and lions, and animals of that kind, are by their own instinct driven to a distance from cities,
 not being inclined to expose themselves to danger in consequence of the devices of men. (58) And
 if any men, being influenced by a spirit of laziness and indolence, living without arms and without
 preparation, dwell fearlessly among the haunts of wild beasts, then if anything happens to them
 they must blame not nature but themselves, because when they might have guarded against any
 such disasters, they have neglected them. Accordingly, before now, I have seen at the
 horse-races some persons acting in a most careless manner, who, when they ought to have sat
 still and to have beheld the races in an orderly manner, standing in the middle have been knocked
 down by the horses' feet and by the wheels, and have met with a proper reward for their folly. (59)
 We have now, then, said enough on this subject.
<p>
 But of reptiles, those which are venomous have not been called into existence by an immediate
 providence, but by the natural consequences of events, as I said before; for they are brought into
 life when the moisture which is in them changes to a more violent heat; and some are vivified by
 putrefaction, as, for instance, the putrefaction of meat produces maggots, and that which is
 caused by perspiration produces lice; but all those which are produced out of a kindred substance,
 and which have their generation in accordance with the usual spermatic principles which I have
 mentioned before, are very naturally ascribed to an immediate providence. (60) And I have also
 heard two accounts given of them as having been created for the advantage of mankind, which I
 should not think it well to conceal. Now one of them is the following.
<p>
 Some persons have said that venomous animals contribute greatly to many of the objects of
 physicians, and that those who reduce that science to a regular system use them in a proper
 manner, and, acting with great wisdom and prudence, have discovered antidotes, so as to be able
 to contribute to the unexpected safety of those who were in the greatest possible danger; and even
 at the present time one may see those persons who apply themselves to the study of medicine, in
 a careful and diligent manner, using all these animals and plants in a most skilful manner in the
 composition of drugs.
<p>
 (61) The other account has no reference to the practice of physicians, but only as it would seem to
 the studies of philosophers. For it says that all these things have been prepared by God as
 engines of punishment against offenders, just as generals and rulers prepare halters and chains.
 On which account, though they are quiet at other times, they are brought out with great power in the
 case of people who have been condemned, and whom nature in her incorruptible tribunal has
 sentenced to death; (62) for that they lurk in secret holes and in houses, is a falsehood; for it is
 seen that these creatures flee out of the cities into the fields and into desert places, to avoid man
 as their master. Not but what, if this is true, there is a certain sense and principle in it; for rubbish is
 heaped up in recesses: and quantities of sweepings, and refuse, and such things, are what
 venomous reptiles love to lurk in, besides the fact that their smell has an attractive power over
 them.
<p>
 (63) Again, if swallows live among us, it is not at all strange, for we abstain from hunting them; and
 a desire of safety is implanted not only in the souls of rational creatures, but also in those of
 irrational animals.
<p>
 But of those animals which tend to our enjoyment, there is not one which lives with us by reason of
 the designs which we form against them, except that some do live with those nations to whom the
 use of them is forbidden by the law. (64) There is a city of Syria, on the sea shore, Ascalon by
 name: when I was there, at the time when I was on my journey towards the temple of my native land
 for the purpose of offering up prayers and sacrifices therein, I saw a most incalculable number of
 pigeons on the roads and about every house; and when I inquired the cause of their being there in
 such numbers, they said that it was not lawful to catch them, for that the use of them had been
 prohibited to the inhabitants from the earliest ages; and so the bird had become so thoroughly
 tame through fearlessness, that it not only hovered about the roofs and came into the houses, but
 approached their tables also, and grew luxurious in the alliance which it had thus formed.
<p>
 (65) And in Egypt we may see a still more marvellous thing; for the crocodile is the most odious of
 all animals, and one addicted to devour man; and it is born and brought up in the most sacred way,
 and although residing in the depths, it feels the benefits which it receives from mankind; for in those
 tribes, among which it is honoured, it multiplies in the greatest degree, but among those who injure
 it it never appears at all: so that there are places where even the most timid persons when sailing
 by leap out of their ships and swim about with their children.
<p>
 (66) And in the country of the Cyclops, since the race of these men is a fabulous invention, there is
 no eatable fruit whatever produced except such as is raised from seed and cultivated by
 husbandmen, just as nothing is produced from that which does not exist; but we must not accuse
 Greece as being sterile and unproductive, for there is a great deal of deep and rich soil in it; and if
 the land of the barbarians is superior in fruitfulness, though it is superior in the food which it
 produces, it is inferior in the men who are nourished by the food, and for whose sake the food is
 produced.
<p>
 For Greece is the only country which really produces man, that heavenly plant, that divine offshoot,
 producing that most accurately refined reason which is appropriated by and akin to knowledge; and
 the cause is this, it is the nature of the intellect to be rendered acute by the lightness of the air; (67)
 on which account Heraclitus said with great propriety, "Where the soil is dry, there the soul is most
 wise and most excellent;" and any one may conjecture this from the fact, that men who are sober
 and contented with a little are wise, and that those who are continually filling themselves with meat
 and drink are the least sensible, as if their reasoning faculties were drowned by the quantity which
 they swallow.
<p>
 (68) And on this account we see, in the countries of the barbarians, trees and plants grow to the
 greatest possible size, by reason of the abundance of nourishment which they receive; and we see
 too, that the irrational animals which are found in these regions are the most prolific of any, but the
 mind is not so, or, at all events, it is so in a very slight degree, because it is elevated and raised out
 of the aether itself, while the incessant and uninterrupted evaporations of earth and water have
 freely boiled over it. (69) Again, the different kinds of fish, and birds, and terrestrial animals, are
 not grounds for accusing nature, which invites us to pleasure by those means, but are a terrible
 reproach to us for our intemperate use of them, for it was necessary, for the due completion of the
 universe, in order that there should be order and regularity in every portion of it, that there should
 be produced every possible species of animal. But it was not necessary that that animal, which of
 all others is most akin to wisdom, namely, man, should rush with such eagerness to the enjoyment
 of it, as to change his nature into something resembling the ferocity of wild beasts; (70) on which
 account, even up to the present time, those who have any regard for temperance entirely abstain
 from such things, eating only vegetables, and herbs, and the fruits of trees, as the most delicious
 and wholesome food.
<p>
 And these men are instructors for those who look upon the practice of eating such animals to be in
 accordance with nature, and correct them, and are lawgivers to their respective cities, being men
 who take care to check the immoderate vehemence of the appetites, and who do not permit the
 unrestrained use of everything to everybody.
<p>
 (71) Again, if roses, and crocuses, and all the other beautiful variety of flowers which we see,
 contribute to health, it would not follow that they all contribute to pleasure; for the indescribable
 variety of them makes the powers of some of them more conspicuous than those of others, just as
 there is a commingling of male and female, contributing to the generation of an animal; neither of
 them being calculated, by itself, to produce the effect which the two produce in combination.
<p>
 (72) These things are said, in a most convincing manner, with reference to the rest of the
 questions raised by you, being quite sufficient to produce conviction in the minds of all who are not
 obstinately contentious on the subject of God taking great care of human Affairs.{4}{yonge's edition
