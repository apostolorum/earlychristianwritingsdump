<title>Philo: On the Posterity of Cain and His Exile</title></head><body>
 ON THE POSTERITY OF CAIN AND HIS EXILE{*}
<p>
  {**Yonge's title, A Treatise on the Posterity of Cain, the Man Wise in His own Conceit; and on the Way in Which
<p>                             Cain Became an Exile.}
<p>
   I. (1) "And Cain went out from before the face of God, and dwelt in the land of Nod, opposite to
 Eden."{1}{#ge 4:16.} Now we may raise the question whether we are to take the expressions
 which occur in the books that have been handed down to us by Moses and to interpret them in a
 somewhat metaphorical sense, while the ideas which readily present themselves as derived from
 the names are very deficient in truth. (2) For if the living God has a face, and if he who desires to
 leave it can with perfect ease rise up and depart to another place, why do we repudiate the impiety
 of the Epicureans, or the godlessness of the Egyptians, or the mythical suggestions of which life is
 full? (3) For the face is a portion of an animal; but God is a whole, not a part: so that it becomes
 necessary to invent for him other parts also, a neck, and a chest, and hands, and moreover a
 belly, feet, and generative organs, and all the rest of the countless number of internal and external
 faculties. (4) And the fact of God's having passions like unto those of man follows of necessity
 from the fact of his having a form like that of man: since all those limbs are not superfluous and
 mere exuberances, but have been made by nature as assistants of the weakness of those who
 possess them, and she has adapted them in a manner suitable to and consistent with their natural
 necessities and offices. But the living God has need of nothing; so that as he does not at all
 require the assistance to be derived from the parts of the body, he cannot possibly have such
 parts at all.
<p>
 II. (5) And from whence does Cain go forth? is it from the palace of the ruler of the world? But what
 house of God can exist perceptible by the outward senses except this world which it is impossible
 and impracticable to quit? For the great circle of the heaven binds round and contains within itself
 everything which has ever been created; and of those things which have already perished, the
 component parts are resolved into their original elements, and are again portioned off among
 those powers of the universe of which they consist, the loan which, as it were, was advanced to
 each, being restored back at unequal periods of time, in accordance with laws previously laid
 down, to the nature which originally made it, whenever that nature chooses to call in its debts. (6)
 Again, if any person goes out from any place, that which he leaves behind him is in a different
 place from that in which he now is, but if this be true it must follow that there are some portions of
 the universe deprived of the presence of God, who never leaves any place empty or destitute of
 himself, but who fills up all things for all time; (7) and if God has not a face (inasmuch as he is not
 bound by what may seem appropriate for created things), and if he does not exist in parts
 inasmuch as he surrounds all things and is not surrounded by any, it is impossible for anything to
 remove and depart from this world as from a city, as there is no portion of it left without. It now
 remains for us, considering that none of these things are spoken of in terms of strict propriety, to
 turn to the allegorical system, which is dear to men versed in natural philosophy, taking the first
 principles of our argument from this source. (8) If it is hard to depart from before the face and out
 of the sight of a mortal king, how can it be anything but extremely difficult to depart and quit the
 appearance of God, and to determine no longer to come into his sight. This indeed is to be left
 without any idea of him, and to be mutilated as to the eyes of the soul, (9) and all those who of
 necessity have endured this fate, being weighed down by the might of irresistible and implacable
 power, are objects rather for pity than for hatred; but all those who voluntarily and of deliberated
 purposes have rejected the living God, exceeding even the bounds of wickedness itself, for what
 other evil of equal weight can possibly be found? Such men should suffer not the usual
 punishments of evil doers, but something new and extraordinary. And surely no one could invent a
 more novel or more terrible penalty than a departure and flight from the presence of the Ruler of
 the universe.
<p>
 III. (10) Accordingly God banished Adam; but Cain went forth from his presence of his own accord;
 Moses here showing to us the manner of each sort of absence from God, both the voluntary and
 the involuntary sort; but the involuntary sort as not existing in consequence of any intention on our
 part, will subsequently have such a remedy applied to it as the case admits of; for God will raise up
 another offspring in the place of Abel, whom Cain slew, a male offspring for the soul which has not
 turned by its own intention, by name Seth, which name being interpreted means irrigation; (11) but
 the voluntary flight from God, as one that has taken place by deliberate purpose and intention, will
 await on irremediable punishment in all eternity, for as good deeds that are done in consequence
 of forethought and design, are better than unintentional ones, so also among offences those that
 are undesigned are of less heinousness than those that are premeditated.
<p>
 IV. (12) Therefore punishment which is the chastiser of impious men, will await Cain who has now
 departed from before the face of God, but Moses will suggest to those who know God, a most
 excellent suggestion, to love God and to obey him, and cleave to him, for he tells men that this is
 the life which in truth is tranquil and lasting, {2}{#de 30:20.} and he very emphatically invites us
 to the honour of the one being who is above all others to be beloved and honoured, bidding us
 cleave to him, recommending to us a continual and constant and inseparable harmony and union of
 friendship with him. (13) These suggestions and such as these are what he gives to the rest of the
 world, but he himself so insatiably desires to behold him, and to be beheld by him, that he
 supplicates him to display to his eye his nature of which it is impossible to form a conjecture, so
 that he may become acquainted with it, {3}{#ex 33:18.} that thus he might receive a most
 well-grounded certainty of knowledge that could not be mistaken, in exchange for uncertain doubts;
 and he will never cease from urging his desire, but even, though he is aware that he desires a
 matter which is difficult of attainment, or rather which is wholly unattainable, he still strives on, in no
 way remitting his intense anxiety, but without admitting any excuse, or any hesitation, or vacillation;
 using all the means in his power to gain his object.
<p>
 V. (14) At all events, he will now penetrate into "the darkness where God Was."{4}{#ex 20:13.} That
 is to say, into those unapproachable and invisible conceptions which are formed of the living Do.
 For the great Cause of all things does not exist in time, nor at all in place, but he is superior to both
 time and place; for, having made all created things in subjection to himself, he is surrounded by
 nothing, but he is superior to everything. And being superior to, and being also external to the world
 that he has made, he nevertheless fills the whole world with himself; for, having by his own power
 extended it to its utmost limits, he has connected every portion with another portion according to
 the principles of harmony. (15) When, therefore, the soul that loves God seeks to know what the
 one living God is according to his essence, it is entertaining upon an obscure and dark subject of
 investigation, from which the greatest benefit that arises to it is to comprehend that God, as to his
 essence, is utterly incomprehensible to any being, and also to be aware that he is invisible. (16)
 And it appears to me that the great hierophant had attained to the comprehension of the most
 important point in this investigation before he commenced it, when he entreated God to become
 the exhibitor and expounder of his own nature to him, {5}{#ex 33:12.} for he says, "Show me
 thyself;" showing very plainly by this expression that no created being is competent by himself to
 learn the nature of God in his essence.
<p>
 VI. (17) On this account too, Abraham, when he had come unto the place which God had told him
 of, "On the third day, looking up, saw the place afar Off."{6}{#ge 22:4.} What kind of place? Was it
 the place to which he came? And how was it still afar off, if he had already come to it? (18) But
 perhaps the meaning which is intended under this expression may be something like this:--The
 wise man, being always desirous to comprehend the nature of the Ruler of the universe, when he
 is proceeding along the road which leads by knowledge and wisdom, previously meets with words
 of God, among which he rests for a while; and though he had previously determined to proceed by
 some other road, he now stops and hesitates; for the eyes of his mind being opened, he sees
 more clearly that he had entered upon a chase after a thing which was difficult to overtake, which
 constantly retreated before him, and was always at a distance, and which outstripped its pursuers
 by placing an immeasurable distance between them. (19) You think, therefore, rightly that all the
 speediest things which are under heaven would appear to be standing still if compared with the
 rapidity of the sun, and moon, and other stars. And yet the whole heaven was made by God; and
 the maker always goes before that which is made. So that, of necessity, not only the other things
 which exist among us, but also that which has the most rapid motion of all, namely, the mind, may
 fall short of a proper comprehension of the great cause of all things by an undescribable distance.
 But the stars, as they are themselves in motion, pass by all things that move; but, though it seems
 incredible, God, while standing still, outstrips everything. (20) And it is said that he, at the same
 moment, is close to us and at a great distance, touching us with his creative or his punishing
 powers, which are close to each individual, and yet at the same time driving away the creature to
 an excessive distance from his nature as existing according to its essence, so that it cannot touch
 him without even the unalloyed and incorporeal efforts of the intellect. (21) Therefore we
 sympathise in joy with those who love God and seek to understand the nature of the living do, even
 if they fail to discover it; for the vague investigation of what is good is sufficient by itself to cheer
 the heart, even if it fail to attain the end that it desires. But we participate in indignation against that
 lover of himself, Cain; because he has left his soul without any conception whatever of the living
 God, having of deliberate purpose mutilated himself of that faculty by which alone he might have
 been able to see him.
<p>
 VII. (22) It is worth while also to consider the wickedness into which a man who flies from the face
 of God is driven, since it is called a tempest. The law-giver showing, by this expression, that he
 who gives way to inconsiderate impulses without any stability or firmness exposes himself to surf
 and violent tossing, like those of the sea, when it is agitated in the winter season by contrary winds,
 and has never even a single glimpse of calm or tranquillity. But as when a ship having been tossed
 in the sea is agitated, it is then no longer fit to take a voyage or to anchor in harbour, but being
 tossed about hither and thither it leans first to one side and then to the other, and struggles in vain
 against the waves; so the wicked man, yielding to a perverse and insane disposition, and being
 unable to regulate his voyage through life without disaster, is constantly tossed about in perpetual
 expectation of an overturning of his life. (23) But the connection of the consequence affects me in
 no moderate degree; for it happens that that which comes near to him who is standing still longs for
 tranquillity, as being something which resembles itself. Now that which stands still without any
 deviation is God, and that which is moved is the creature, so that he who comes near to God
 desires stability; but he who departs from him, as by so doing he is approaching a creature easily
 overturned, is borne towards that which resembles it.
<p>
 VIII. (24) On this account it is written in the curses contained in scripture, "Thou shalt never rest;
 nor shall there be any rest for the sole of thy Foot."{7}{#de 28:65.} And, a little afterwards, we
 read that, "Thy life shall hang in doubt before Them."{8}{#de 28:66.} For it is the nature of the
 foolish man, who is always being tossed about in a manner contrary to right reason, to be hostile to
 tranquillity and rest, and not to stand firmly or with a sure foundation on any doctrine whatever. (25)
 Accordingly he is full of different opinions at different times, and sometimes, even in the same
 circumstances, without any new occurrence having arisen to affect them, he will be perfectly
 contrary to himself, --now great, now little, now hostile, now friendly; and, in short, he will, so to say,
 be everything that is most inconsistent in a moment of time. And, as the law-giver says, "All his life
 shall hang in doubt before him;" having no firm footing, but being constantly tossed about by
 opposing circumstances, which drag it different ways. (26) On which account Moses says, in
 another place, "Cursed of God is he that hangeth on a Tree;"{9}{#de 21:23.} because what he
 ought to hang upon is God. But such a man has, of his own accord, bound himself to the body,
 which is a wooden burden upon us, exchanging hope for desire and a perfect hope for the greatest
 of evils; for hope, being the expectation of good things, causes the mind to depend upon the
 bounteous God; but appetite, creating only unreasonable desires, depends on the body, which
 nature has made to be a sort of receptacle and abode for the soul.
<p>
 IX. (27) Let these men, then, hang by their appetites as by a halter; but the wise Abraham, where
 he stands, comes near to God, who is also standing. For Moses says that "Abraham was standing
 near to God; and coming nigh unto him, he Said,"{10}{#ge 18:22, 23.}... For in good truth the
 unalterable soul is the only thing that has access to the unalterable God; and being of such a
 disposition, it does really stand very near to the Divine power. (28) Therefore the oracle which was
 given to the allwise Moses most manifestly shows the lasting good condition and stability of the
 virtuous man. Now, the oracle is as follows: "And do thou thyself stand with Me."{11}{#de 5:31.}
 By which expression, two things are made clear. One, that it is the living God, who moves and
 turns about all other beings, being himself unchangeable and immoveable. The second is, that he
 makes the virtuous man a participator in his own tranquil nature. For, as I suppose, the crooked
 things are made straight by his straight rule; so, likewise, are the things that are in motion
 restrained and made stationary by the power of him who always stands still and firm. (29) In this
 passage, therefore, he commands another being to stand with him: but in another place he says, "I
 will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will conduct thee to the End."{12}{#ge 46:4.} He does not say,
 Thou shalt go down with me. Why not? Because calmness and stability are the especial attributes
 of God; but a liability to change one's place, and every kind of motion which has a tendency to
 change the place, is incident to a created being. When, therefore, he invites the man to his own
 peculiar good, he says, "Stand thou with me:" not "I will stand with thee." For "will stand," cannot be
 said of God, who always stands still. (30) But when he comes to that which is the peculiar attribute
 of the creature, he says, with the most perfect correctness, "I will go down with you;" for change of
 place is adapted to you: so that no one shall go down with me, for in me there is no changing; but
 whatever is consistent with me, that is to say, with rest, shall stand. And with those who go down in
 such a manner as to change their place (for change of place is akin to and closely connected with
 them), I will go down also, not indeed changing my situation as to its actual place, inasmuch as I fill
 every place with myself. (31) And this, too, I do through the pity which exists in rational nature, in
 order that it may be raised from the hell of the passions to the heavenly region of virtue; I being the
 guide, who also have made the road which leads to heaven, so that it may be a plain road for
 suppliant souls, and have shown it to them all, in order that they may not foolishly wander out of the
 way.
<p>
 X. (32) Having, therefore, now pointed out each variety, the tranquillity of the good man, and the
 state of agitation in which the bad man lives, let us now consider what follows the statement which
 we have hitherto been examining. For Moses says that Nod, which name, being interpreted, means
 the tumult into which the soul has migrated, is opposite to Eden. Now Eden is a symbolical
 expression for correct and divine reason, on which account its interpretation is luxury; because
 divine reason is, above all other things, delighted with and exults among unmingled and pure, and
 also well filled up and complete pleasure, God, the giver of all good things, raising his virgin and
 undying graces upon it. But by its own intrinsic nature, the bad is always striving with the good, the
 unjust with the just, the wise with the foolish, and all the different species of virtue with all the
 different species of vice. Something like this is the meaning of the statement that Nod is opposite
 to Eden.
<p>
 XI. (33) After he had said this he proceeds to say, "And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived
 and bare Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son
 Enoch."{13}{#ge 4:17.} Is it not here reasonable to raise the question, why Cain knew his wife? for
 there had been no birth of any one other woman since that of Eve who was formed out of the side
 of the man, until the woman who is here mentioned; (34) and if any one says that Cain took his
 sister to wife, putting the impiety of such a connection out of the question, he will speak falsely; for
 Moses represents the daughters of Adam as born late. What then are we to say? As I imagine,
 Moses here calls his wife opinion of impious reason which it forms about things, as crowds of
 those who have studied philosophy do: some of them introducing the same opinions into human
 life, and others introducing such as are wholly at variance with one another. (35) What then is the
 position of the impious man? Why, that the human mind is the measure of all things; which also
 they say that one of the ancient philosophers, Protagoras, used to employ, being a descendant of
 the folly of Cain. And from thence I conjecture that his wife, being known to him, brought forth
 Enoch; and the name Enoch being interpreted means, thy grace. (36) For if man is the measure of
 all things, then, also, all things are a grace and a free gift of the mind; so that we refer to the eye
 the grace of sight, to the ears that of hearing, and to each of the other external senses their
 appropriate object, and also to the speech and utterance do we attribute the power of speaking.
 And if we judge in this manner of these things, so also do we with respect to intelligence, in which
 ten thousand things are comprised, such as thoughts, perceptions, designs, meditations,
 conceptions, sciences, arts, dispositions, and a number of other faculties almost incalculable. (37)
 What is it then that the gravest philosophers, who have talked in the most grandiloquent manner
 about divine law and the honour due to God, have determined both to say and to allow to be said, If
 ye have in ye a mind which is equal to God, which regulating by its own power all the good and bad
 things which exist among men, occasionally mingles both in certain persons, and sometimes
 distributes both good and bad to some in an unalloyed state; (38) and if any one accuses you of
 impiety, make your defence with a good courage, saying that you have been brought up very
 admirably by your guide and teacher, Cain, who recommended you to honour the powers that are
 nearest in preference to that cause which was afar off, to whom you ought to attend for many other
 reasons, and most especially because he showed the power of his doctrine by very evident works,
 having conquered Abel the expounder of the opposite doctrine, and having removed and destroyed
 his doctrine as well as himself. (39) But in my opinion and in that of my friends, death in the
 company of the pious would be preferable to life with the impious; for those who die in the company
 of the pious everlasting life will receive, but everlasting death will be the portion of those who live in
 the other way.
<p>
 XII. (40) But as after Cain had begotten Enoch, one of the posterity of Seth is also subsequently
 called Enoch, it may be well to consider, whether the two namesakes were men of different or of
 similar dispositions and characters. And at the same time that we examine this question let us also
 investigate the differences between other persons bearing the same name. For as Enoch was, so
 also Methusaleh and Lamech were both descendants of Cain, and they were no less the
 descendants of Seth also. (41) We must therefore be aware that each of the aforesaid names,
 being interpreted, has a double signification; for Enoch, being interpreted, means, as I have
 already said, "thy grace," and Methusaleh means, the sending forth of death. Lamech, again
 means, humiliation. Now the expression, "Thy grace," is by some persons referred to the mind that
 is in us; and by more learned and sounder interpreters it is referred to the mind of other persons.
 (42) They therefore who say that all thinking, and feeling, and speaking, are the free gifts of their
 own soul, utter an impious and ungodly opinion, and deserve to be classed among the race of
 Cain, who, though he was not able to master himself, yet dared to assert that he had absolute
 possession of all other things; but as for those persons who do not claim all the things in creation
 as their own, but who ascribe them to the divine grace, being men really noble and sprung out of
 those who were rich long ago, but of those who love virtue and piety, they may be classed under
 Seth as the author of their race. (43) The race of these men is difficult to trace, since they show a
 life of plotting, and cunning, and wickedness, and dissoluteness, full of passion and wickednesses,
 as such a life must be. For all those whom God, since they pleased him well, has caused to quit
 their original abode, and has transformed from the race of perishable beings to that of immortals,
 are no longer found among the common multitude.
<p>
 XIII. (44) Having, therefore, thus distinguished the indications intended to be afforded by the name
 of Enoch, let us now proceed in regular order to the name of Methuselah; and this name is
 interpreted, a sending forth of death. Now there are two meanings contained in this word; one, that
 according to which death is sent to any one, and the other, that according to which it is sent away
 from any one. He, therefore, to whom it is sent, immediately dies, but he, from whom it is sent, lives
 and survives. (45) Accordingly, he who receives death is akin to Cain, who is dying as to the life in
 accordance with virtue; but he from whom death is sent away and kept at a distance, is most nearly
 related to Seth, for the good man enjoys real life. (46) And again, the name Lamech, which means
 humiliation, is a name of ambiguous meaning; for we are humiliated either when the vigour of our
 soul is relaxed, according to the diseases and infirmities which arise from the irrational passions,
 or in respect of our love for virtue, when we seek to restrain ourselves from swelling selfopinions.
 (47) Now the former kind of humiliation arises out of weakness, being a species of that multiform
 disease of many changes, leprosy. "For when his appearance seems more Humble,"{14}{#le 13:3.}
 being broken as to its level and fresh face, than the lawgiver says that that humble disease
 leprosy exists. (48) But the second kind of humiliation arises from the strength of perseverance,
 which is followed by propitiation, according to the perfect number of the decade; for the people are
 enjoined to humble their souls on the tenth day of the month, and this means to put away all high
 boasting, the putting away of which works the rejection of all offences, both voluntary and
 involuntary. Accordingly, the Lamech who is humbled in this sense, is the descendant of Seth, and
 the father of the just Noah; but he who is humbled in the former manner is the descendant of Cain.
<p>
 XIV. (49) And it may become us next to consider on what account this same man is represented
 as founding and building a city, for it is only a multitude of men who have need of a city to dwell in;
 but the three who were the only human beings in existence at that time might have thought the foot
 of a mountain, or a small cave, a most sufficient abode. And I said, indeed, the three; but in all
 probability I might have spoken of him by himself; for the parents of Abel, who had been so
 treacherously slain, would never have endured to inhabit the same city with his murderer--a man
 who had committed fratricide, which is a greater pollution than even homicide. (50) For it is plain
 that it is not only extraordinary, but utterly contrary to all reason, that one man should build a city. In
 what manner could he do it? He could not build even the most trifling portion of a house, unless he
 employed other men as his assistants. Would the same man be able at the same time to cut
 stones, to cut wood, to work in iron and in brass, and to throw the vast circumference of walls
 round the city? to build up propylaea, and inter-walls, and temples, and sacred precincts, and
 porticoes, and docks, and houses, and all the other public and private buildings which one is
 accustomed to find in a city? And moreover, besides all these things, would he be able to carry
 burdens, to move away masses of earth, to widen narrow passages, to make fountains and
 water-courses, and all the other things with which a city ought to be provided? (51) Perhaps,
 therefore, since all these ideas are inconsistent with truth, it would be better to look upon the
 statement as an allegory, and to say that Cain determined to build up his own doctrine like a city.
<p>
 XV. (52) Since, therefore, every city consists of houses and inhabitants, and laws, the houses, in
 Cain's case, are the reasons which he alleges to prove his point; by which, as from a wall, he fights
 against the persuasive attacks of his enemies; inventing fabulous devices against the truth. The
 inhabitants are the companions of impiety, ungodliness, self-love, haughtiness, falsehood, vain
 opinions; the men wise in their own conceit, the men who know not wisdom as relating to truth, the
 men who are full of ignorance, and stupidity, and folly; and all the other similar and kindred evils.
 The laws are, lawlessness, injustice, inequality, intemperance, boldness, folly, insolence,
 immoderate indulgence in pleasure, and innumerable appetites in despite of nature. (53) Now of
 such a city as this, every impious man is found to be a builder in his own miserable soul, until God
 deliberately causes complete and great confusion to their sophistical Arts.{15}{#ge 11:4.} And this
 will be, when not only "they build a city and tower, the head of which will reach to heaven," that is to
 say, [...]{16}{there is a hiatus in the text here: Mangey translates it as if the deficiency were to be supplied by ton noun,
 "the mind."} the mind or the reason of each individual as conversant about making great works, which
 they represent as having for its head a conception peculiar to itself, which is called in symbolical
 language heaven. For it is plain that the head and object of every reasoning must be the aforesaid
 mind; for the sake of which, long digressions and sentences are in the habit of being used by men
 who write histories.
<p>
 XVI. (54) And to such a pitch of accursed impiety have they gone, that not only do they attempt to
 raise up such cities by themselves, but they even compel the virtue-loving multitude of Israel to join
 them, appointing superintendents and teachers of evil actions to govern them. For it is said that,
 when they were ill-treated by the superintendents, they built three cities for the prince of the
 country, Peithom, Rameses, {17}{#ex 1:11.} and On, which is Heliopolis. (55) And these cities, if
 taken symbolically, mean mind, the outward sense, and the faculty of speech, which are the three
 principal things in us; for Peithom means speech, because persuasion (to peithein) arises from
 speech; and the interpretation of Peithom is, a mouth-uttering, since the reasoning of the wicked
 man comes from without, and occupies itself with endeavouring to overturn all that is good: and
 Rameses is the inward sense; (56) for the mind is eaten out and destroyed by each separate one
 of the outward senses as by a moth, being shaken to pieces and lacerated; for the imaginations
 which enter it, not according to pleasure, make life itself mutilated and laborious. (57) But On is
 said to be a hill, and it means, symbolically, the mind; for all reasonings are stored up in the mind:
 and the lawgiver himself is a witness of this, calling On, Heliopolis, the city of the sun. For as the
 sun, when he rises, shows visibly the things which have been hidden by night, so also the mind,
 sending forth its own proper light, causes all bodies and all things to be seen visibly at a distance.
 (58) On which account, a man would not be wrong who called our minds the sun of our
 composition; as the mind, if it does not rise and shed its own light in man, who may be looked upon
 as a small world, leaves a great darkness diffused over all existing things, and suffers nothing to be
 brought to light.
<p>
 XVII. (59) This hill Jacob, the wrestler with God, in his agreements with Laban, calls a witness,
 showing in a most express manner, and in the form of a precept, that the mind is a witness to each
 individual of the determinations which he comes to in secret; and conscience, which is the most
 incorruptible and truth-telling witness of all, was built before these cities; (60) for Moses says that
 the spies came to Chebron, and these three are Acheman, and Jesein, and Thalamein, of the
 sons of Enoch: and this he adds, "and Chebron was built seven years before Janis, in
 Egypt,"{18}{#nu 13:23.} and these synonymous appellations are distinguished according to their
 species in a most natural manner. Chebron, being interpreted, means compunction, and this is of
 two kinds; one with reference to the soul being joined to the body, the other with reference to its
 being adapted to virtue. (61) Now the soul that subjects itself to bodily compunctions has the
 beforementioned inhabitants. Acheman, being interpreted, means, my brother, and Jesein means
 "outside of me," and Thalmein means, some one in suspense; for it follows of necessity, that the
 body must be thought akin to the souls that love the body, and that external good things must be
 exceedingly admired by them, and all the souls which have this kind of disposition depend on dead
 things, and, like persons who are crucified, are attached to corruptible matter till the day of their
 death. (62) But the soul that is united to virtue has for its inhabitants those persons who are
 preeminent for virtue, persons whom the double cavern has received in pairs, Abraham and Sarah,
 Isaac and Rebeckah, Leah and Jacob, virtues and those who possess them; Chebron itself
 keeping the treasure-house of the memorials of knowledge and wisdom, which is more ancient
 than Janis and the whole land of Egypt, for nature has made the soul more ancient than the body,
 that is than Egypt, and virtue more ancient than vice, that is than Janis (and the name Janis, being
 interpreted, means the command of answer), estimating seniority rather by dignity than by length of time.
<p>
 XVIII. (63) On which principle also it is that he also calls Israel, who was the younger brother in
 point of time, "the first born Son,"{19}{#ex 4:22.} judging of him by his merit, signifying thereby that,
 since to see God is the most clear proof of primogeniture, he is in consequence pardoned as the
 eldest offspring of the uncreate incomprehensible God, conceived by that virtue which is hated
 among men, and to whom the law enjoins that "the honours due to seniority shall be paid, as being
 the Eldest."{20}{#de 21:17.} (64) On this account also the number seven is produced in its
 order, subsequently to the number six, but in power it is superior to every other number, and differs
 not from the unit, and Moses also shows us this in the conclusion of his account of the creation,
 where he says, "And God ceased on the seventh day from all the works that he had made; and
 God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it," because on it he ceased from all his works which
 God had begun to make, {21}{#ge 2:2.} (65) and after that he concludes his account in these
 words, "This is the book of the generation of heaven and of earth when they were made, on the
 day in which God made the heaven and the earth; and these things were done in the first day, so
 that the seventh day is referred to the unit which is the first day and the beginning of the whole. I
 have dwelt at length on this topic, with the object of showing more plainly the opinion which Cain
 thought it right to build up like a city.
<p>
 XIX. (66) Now the son of Enoch is called Gaidad, {22}{#ge 4:18.} which, being interpreted, means
 a flock of sheep, very consistently with what has gone before; for he who attributes everything to
 the mind, which is not able to comprehend even its own nature, so as to pronounce what kind of
 thing it is, would be very likely to beget a number of irrational powers collected into one flock; for
 such is not the opinion of men who are able to reason. (67) But every flock which has not a
 shepherd to govern it does of necessity meet with great disasters, inasmuch as it is not able, of its
 own power, to repel what is injurious to it, and to choose what will be advantageous; in respect of
 which Moses says in his prayer, "Let the Lord, the God of spirits and of all flesh, look out a man
 who shall be over this assembly, who shall go out before their faces, and who shall come in, and
 who shall bring them out, and who shall bring them in, and so the synagogue of the Lord shall not be
 like unto sheep which have no Shepherd."{23}{#nu 26:16.} (68) For when the president, or
 superintendent, or father, or whatever we like to call him, of our composite body, right reason, is
 departed, having left the flock that is in us, it being neglected and suffered to go its own way,
 perishes and the loss to its master is great. But the irrational and wandering flock, being deprived
 of its shepherd, who ought to admonish and instruct it, strays away to a great distance from
 rational and immortal life.
<p>
 XX. (69) On which account the son of Gaided is called Mehel, the name which, being interpreted,
 means, "from the life of God." For since the flock is devoid of reason, and God is the fountain of
 reason, it follows of necessity, that a man who lives in an irrational manner is separated from the
 life of God; for to live according to God is defined by Moses to consist in loving him; for Moses
 says to the children of Israel, "Your life is to love the living God."{24}{#de 30:20.} (70) And he
 gives as an example of the opposite lot the goat, on which the lot falls to be the scape-goat, for he
 says, "He shall place it living before the Lord, that he may offer prayers over it, and send it out into
 the Wilderness,"{25}{#le 16:10.} giving these directions with great exactness. (71) For as no one
 in his senses would greatly extol old men for abstaining from pleasure, because old age, which is a
 long and incurable disease, has relaxed and enfeebled the nerves of their appetites; but one would
 praise young men, because, while their appetites are influenced by the vigour of youth,
 nevertheless they, being well supplied with instruments to check them, namely, with reasons
 derived from good instruction, have allayed the great conflagration and boiling over of the
 passions: so, in the case of these men, whom no disease is accustomed to detach from any evil
 way of life, less praise is due to them, because they are fortunate without any express intention of
 their own, according to the good fortune of their nature: but those whom such a disease does rise
 up against and attack, receive greater praise; if they, making a fair stand, are willing and prove
 able to destroy it; (72) for to be able, by a vigorous exertion, to destroy the baits of attractive
 pleasure, properly receives that praise which belongs to good actions, done with a deliberate
 purpose.
<p>
 Since, therefore, [...]{26}{there is something lost from the text here, and Mangey professes himself unable to supply
 it without the assistance of some MS. which may be hereafter discovered.} but diseases and infirmities which
 have been sent against us flourish; let us endeavour to overturn and destroy them. For to offer
 prayers over them has nearly such an effect as this: it is confessing that, though we have them in
 our soul living and flourishing, we nevertheless do not yield, but make a stand against them all, and
 resist them vigorously, until we have entirely sent away the scape-goat and made atonement.
<p>
 XXI. (73) What, then, follows a man who lives not in accordance with the will of God but the death
 of the soul? And this is named Methuselah, the interpretation of which name is, "the sending out of
 death," on which account he is the son of Mehel, who has quilted his own life, to which death is
 sent, that is to say the death of the soul, which is nothing else than a conversion of it by irrational
 passion. (74) This passion, therefore, when it has conceived, brings forth incurable diseases and
 infirmities with great pains, by which it is thrown down and convulsed, and humbled and tortured.
 For each of the diseases oppresses it, bringing upon it an unspeakable burden, such that no one is
 able even to raise his head beneath it. And this is named Lamech; the interpretation of which name
 is, "humiliation;" so that Lamech is properly represented as the son of Methuselah, being the
 passion of the death of the soul, humble, yielding, an infirmity which is the offspring of irrational
 desire.
<p>
 XXII. (75) "And Lamech took to himself two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of
 the other was Zillah."{27}{#ge 4:19.} Everything which a wicked man taketh himself is altogether
 blameable, as being polluted by his impure mind; and so, on the contrary, all deliberate actions of
 virtuous men are praise-worthy; on which account now, Lamech, who is taking wives unto himself,
 is choosing the greatest possible evils. Again, when Abraham, Jacob, and Aaron take to
 themselves wives, they choose appropriate good things to dwell with. (76) Now Moses speaks thus
 in the case of Abraham: "And Abraham and Nachor took unto themselves wives; the name of
 Abraham's wife was Sarai."{28}{#ge 11:29.} And in the case of Jacob he says, "Rise up and go
 into Mesopotamia, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take unto thyself a wife from
 thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's Brother."{29}{#ge 28:2.} In the case of Aaron he
 says, and Aaron took Elizabeth, the daughter of Aminadab, the sister of Naassom, unto him to be
 his Wife."{30}{#ex 6:23.} (77) Isaac too and Moses take unto themselves wives, but they do not
 take them of their own act entirely; but Isaac, "When he went into the house of his
 Mother,"{31}{#ge 24:67.} is said to have taken a wife; and to Moses, "The man with whom he
 lodged gave his daughter Zipporah to be his Wife."{32}{#ex 2:21.}
<p>
 XXIII. (78) Now it is not without a purpose that the differences between these persons are
 recorded by the lawgiver. For in the case of those who practise virtue and improve, and become
<p>
 better, their deliberate choice of the good bears testimony that their labour shall not be dismissed
 without its reward; but in the case of those who are endued with self-taught and naturally implanted
 wisdom, it follows that reason is betrothed to them not by their own act, but by God, and that they
 take unto themselves knowledge, the fitting companion through life of the wise. (79) But he who is
 wholly devoted to the things of ordinary men, the lowly and grovelling-minded Lamech, first of all
 takes for his wife Adah, which name being interpreted, means "witness," having been his own
 manager of this marriage. For he thinks that Leah, which means the motion and passage out of the
 mind according to easy perceptions, without anything interfering to hinder its easy comprehension
 of all things, is the first good for man. (80) "For what," says he, "could be better than that one's
 thoughts, one's contemplations, one's conjectures, one's suspicions, in a word, all one's ideas,
 should, as I may say, proceed on well-set feet, so as to arrive at their desired goal without
 stumbling, the mind being borne witness to in everything that is uttered." But I, if any man employs a
 felicitous and well directed mind to good objects only, account that man happy taking the law for my
 teacher in this view. For the law called Joseph "a prosperous Man,"{33}{#ge 39:3.} not in all things,
 but "in those matters in which God gave him prosperity." And all the gifts of God are good. (81) But
 if any one uses the acuteness and readiness of his nature, not solely for virtuous objects, but also
 for opposite purposes, being himself indifferent in a matter which is not indifferent, he should be
 accounted unhappy. At all events, it is said, in the manner of a curse, in the place where mention is
 made of the confusion of tongues, "And now nothing will be restrained from them of all the things
 which they have imagined to Do."{34}{#ge 11:6.} For in truth it is an irremediable calamity for the
 soul to be prosperous in whatever it undertakes, when its undertakings are disgraceful. (82) But I
 should pray, if ever I had a design to commit injustice, that I might fail in my iniquity; and if I had a
 wish to live in a manner unbecoming a man, that I might fail in my intemperance; and if I wished to
 conduct myself with boldness and unscrupulous wickedness, that my failure in such boldness and
 unscrupulous wickedness might be complete: unless in the case of those who have determined to
 steal, or to commit adultery, or to murder, it is not an advantage to find their purposes in all these
 matters fail and become abortive.
<p>
 XXIV. (83) Do thou, therefore, O my mind, avoid Adah, who bears witness to evil things, and who is
 borne witness to on each of its attempts at such things. And if you think fit to take her as a partner,
 she will bring forth to you the greatest possible evil, namely, Jubal, {35}{#ge 4:20.} the interpretation
 of which name is "changing;" for if you are delighted with any chance testimony, you will become
 desirous to upset and overturn every thing, changing the limits which have been affixed by nature
 to every thing. (84) And Moses is very indignant with such people as these, and curses them,
 saying, "Cursed is he that removeth his neighbour's Landmark."{36}{#de 27:17.} And what he
 means by one's neighbours, and that which is near to a man, is the good. "For it is not good," says
 he, "to depart to the heave, nor to go beyond the Sea,"{37}{#de 30:12.} in the search after
 what is good; for that stand near to, and close by, each individual. (85) And he divides the good by
 a threefold division, speaking most strictly in accordance with natural philosophy. "For it is," says
 he, "in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in they hands;" that is to say, in thy words, and in thy
 intentions, and in thy actions; for these are the component parts of the good, of which it is naturally
 compounded. So that the want of one portion does not only make the whole incomplete, but does
 entirely destroy it; (86) for of what use is it to say what is excellent, but to think and to do what is
 most shameful? This is the way of the sophists. For those who make long speeches about
 prudence and perseverance, annoy the ears even of those who are very fond of hearing good
 conversation; and yet, in their designs and in the actions of their lives they are found to err. (87)
 And what is the use of entertaining such sentiments as are proper, but acting and speaking most
 improperly, and injuring by your actions all who are exposed to the effect of them? Again, it is
 blameworthy even to do what is right, without any intention or reason; (88) for what is done without
 these is a portion of involuntary conduct, and is on no account, and under no circumstances to be
 praised; but if it were to happen that, as in the case of a lyre, so all the sounds of the good could be
 adapted to any man, and that we could make the conversation agree with the intention, and the
 intention with the action; then such a man would be considered perfect and really well constituted.
 So that he who removes the landmarks of the good is justly accursed, and is justly spoken of as
 such.
<p>
 XXV. (89) But it is not our creation that has established these boundaries, but reasons, which are
 older than we, or than any thing upon the earth; and which, moreover, are divine. In accordance
 with which the law also has declared the same thing, charging every one of us not to adulterate the
 coinage of virtue, in these words, "Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark which thy
 fathers Established."{38}{#de 19:14.} And in another passage he says, "Ask thy father, and he
 will tell thee; ask thy elders, and they will make it known to thee, how the Most High, when he divided
 the nations, dispersed the sons of Adam, and fixed the boundaries of the nations according to the
 number of the angels of God. And the portion of the Lord was his people Jacob, the limitation of the
 inheritance of Israel."{39}{#de 32:7.} (90) Shall I then inquire of the father who begat me and
 brought me up, or of those who are his contemporaries, but older than I am? or has God divided
 the nations, or sown them, or settled them in the land? and will they answer me accurately how this
 was done, as if they had been present at every division? Surely not. For they will say, We also in
 our youth were fond of inquiring of our parents and of those who were older than we, and learnt
 nothing certain; for they had nothing to tell us, and they again professed themselves pupils of those
 who knew, since they themselves were ignorant.
<p>
 XXVI. (91) Perhaps, therefore, it is the right reason of our souls that he calls their father, and its
 companions and friends that he calls elders. These are they who first established the boundaries
 of virtue, to whom it is worth while to become pupils for the sake of learning and instruction in
 necessary things. And what is necessary is as follows. When God was dividing and drawing a wall
 between the nations of the soul, separating those who spoke different languages; and when
 establishing the sons of the earth in their abodes, he dispersed them and removed to a distance
 from himself those whom he called the sons of Adam; then he fixed the boundaries of the offspring
 of virtue, making them equal in number to the angels; for as many angels of God as there are, so
 many nations and species of virtue are there. (92) What, then, are the portions of his angels, and
 what is that share which is the inheritance of the ruler and governor of all? The portion of those
 ministers are the specific virtues; but the portion of the ruler of all its his chosen people Israel. For
 he who sees God, being led on by his most surpassing beauty, has his inheritance and portion
 assigned to him in that which he sees. (93) How, then, can we do any thing but blame Jubal, whose
 name being interpreted into the Greek language, means one who (metalloion e metapoion)
 changes or alters the natures of things? For those most divine beauties of prudence, and fortitude,
 and justice, and other virtues, he did change for the opposite impressions of folly, and
 intemperance, and injustice, and all wickedness, effacing all the impressions which had previously
 been stamped upon the natures of things.
<p>
 XXVII. (94) For it is always the case that if a second impression is stamped upon any thing, the
 mark of any previous one is effaced. But the impression which is thus made is so far from
 permitting evil things to be taken in exchange for what is good, that it does not allow even what is
 beautiful to be taken in exchange for what is laborious; but looking upon what is laborious
 (poneron) as evil, since it would be downright folly not to discard what is bad for the sake of the
 acquisition of what is better, but only taking (poneros) to be equivalent to epiponos or
 kamateros, in which sense, indeed, the Attic writers use the word when they mark the first syllable
 with an acute, thus, poneros. (95) Now the precept is of this kind, "Of every thing which passeth
 under the rod, the tenth is sacred to the Lord; thou shalt not exchange good for bad, and if thou
 dost exchange, both the thing itself and that for which it is exchanged shall be sacred,"{40}
 {#Le 27:32.} and yet how can that which is evil possibly be sacred? The truth is that, as I said, he means
 here what is laborious, not what is bad; so that what is really intended is something of this
 kind:--The honourable is a perfect good, but labour is an imperfect advantage. If therefore you
 acquire what is perfect, you need no longer seek what is deficient; but if with an excessive
 superfluity you choose still to continue labouring, then know that you will appear to be exchanging
 one thing for another, but in reality you will be acquiring both, for even if both are of equal value
 they nevertheless are not completely whole.
<p>
 XXVIII. (96) But a thing which is sacred is proved to be so by three witnesses, the middle number,
 education, and perfect number. On which account it is said, "Of everything which cometh in the
 number under the rod, the tenth is sacred," for that which is not accounted worthy of being
 comprehended under number is profane, not sacred; but that which is according to number is
 approved, as having been already tested. Accordingly the law says, that the corn which was
 collected in Egypt by Joseph could not be Counted,"{41}{#ge 41:49.} and adds, "for it was without
 number," since the things which nourish the body and the Egyptian passions, are utterly unworthy
 to be included in any calculation. (97) But the rod is the symbol of education, for without being
 looked at sternly, and chastised for some causes, it is impossible for any one to be admonished
 and corrected to any good purpose; but the number ten is a confirmation of that perfection which
 takes place in accordance with improvement, with which he must begin who having brought forth an
 offspring educated it, and brought the wished-for fruit to maturity.
<p>
 XXIX. (98) Thus much it may be sufficient to say concerning him who changes and adulterates the
 ancient coinage, whom Moses also calls the father "of those that dwell in the tents of those who
 fed cattle." Now by cattle here he means the irrational and outward senses, and by those who feed
 cattle he means the worshippers of pleasure and indulgences of the passions, who supply these
 senses with their external objects by way of food, and are a long way removed from shepherds.
 For some, like rulers, chastise those of their flocks who are unruly; but others, like entertainers or
 masters of a feast, supply them with unlimited food, and give them fearlessness as to the
 consequences of their sins; for it follows of necessity that such men are at once victims of
 insatiable appetite, and of insolence, the daughter of satiety; (99) accordingly, he who re-fashions
 and changes all honourable things in a seemly and natural manner, is the father of those who
 pursue every object of the outward sense, and all other inanimate objects; for if he had pursued the
 incorporeal natures which are accessible only to the intellect, he would have preserved those
 boundaries marked out by his elders, which they established as a defence to virtue, stamping each
 appearance of virtue with its own appropriate Image.{42}{#de 27:2.}
<p>
 XXX. (100) And Jacob's brother, he says, was Jubal, {43}{#ge 4:21.} and the interpretation of this
 latter name is "inclining," being symbolically speech according to utterance; for this is naturally the
 brother of intellect; and it is with extraordinary propriety that he called the conversation of that
 intellect which changes affairs, "inclining," for it agrees after a fashion and harmonizes with both,
 as the equivalent weight does in a scale, or as a vessel which is tossed by the sea inclines first to
 one side and then to the other, from the violence of the waves; for the foolish man has not learnt
 how to say anything firm or stable. (101) But Moses does not think it right to incline either to the
 right or to the left, or in short to any part of the earthly Edom; but rather to proceed along the middle
 way, which he with great propriety calls the royal road, {44}{#nu 20:17.} for since God is the first
 and only God of the universe, so also the road to him, as being the king's road, is very properly
 denominated royal; and this royal road you must consider to be philosophy, not that philosophy
 which the existing sophistical crowd of men pursues (for they, studying the art of words in
 opposition to truth, have called crafty wickedness, wisdom, assigning a divine name to wicked
 action), but that which the ancient company of those men who practised virtue studied, rejecting the
 persuasive juggleries of pleasure, and adopting a virtuous and austere study of the
 honourable--(102) this royal road, which we have stated to be true and genuine philosophy, the
 law calls the word and reason of God; for it is written, "Thou shalt not turn aside from the word
 which I command thee this day, to the right hand nor to the left," So that it is shown most manifestly
 that the word of God is identical with the royal road, since Moses' words are not to depart either
 from the royal road, or from this word, as if the two were synonymous, but to proceed with an
 upright mind along the middle and level road, which leads one aright.
<p>
 XXXI. (103) "Now this Jubal," says Moses, "is the father who showed men the use of the psaltery
 and of the Harp."{45}{#ge 4:21.} He in the strictest consistency with nature calls distinctly uttered
 language the father of music and of all the instruments used in music; for nature, having given the
 organ of voice to animals as the first and most perfect of organs, afterwards gave to this organ all
 the harmonies, and all the different kinds of melodies, in order that it might be a previously made
 model for those organs which are hereafter to be made by art. (104) And as he made an ear
 spherical, fashioning lesser circles in their greater ones and framing it as in a lathe, with the object
 of preventing the sounds of the voice which come from without from being wasted and dissipated,
 so that the voice when collected together and closely packed within the circle might, by a sort of
 diffusion of the power of hearing, be poured over the different channels of the principal part. And
 this immediately served as a model for those theatres which are found in handsome cities; so that
 the shape of a theatre is skilfully dictated by the mechanism of the ear. So also, nature, which
 formed animals, stretching the rough artery like a musical canon, and wearing beneath the
 harmonic and chromatic and diatonic kinds of sounds, according to the innumerable variations of
 combined and separated melodies, made a model in accordance with which every musical
 instrument might be made.
<p>
 XXXII. (105) Perhaps, at all events, flutes and lyres, and similar instruments which utter melodies,
 are as far inferior to the music of nightingales or swans as a thing made after a model, and an
 imitation must be from the archetypal model, or a perishable species from an imperishable genus;
 for it is not fitting to compare the music of man with that of any other animal, since it has an
 especial privilege with which it is honoured, namely, articulate distinctness of speaking; (106) for all
 other animals, having a broken utterance in their voice, by this and by an incessant change of
 tones alone give pleasure to our ears. But man, being furnished by nature with the means not only
 of speaking but also of singing articulately, charms both the sense of hearing and the mind,
 soothing the one with his song and influencing the other with ideas; (107) for, as an instrument, if it
 be given into the hands of a man who has no skill as a musician, is inharmonious, but if given to a
 musician it becomes harmonious according to the skill that is in him. So in the same manner
 speech, when put in motion by a worthless mind, is inharmonious; but, when it is put in motion by a
 virtuous mind, it is found to be very melodious. (108) A lyre, indeed, or any similar instrument, if it
 be not struck by some one, is silent; and speech, too, if it be not struck by the principal part, that is
 to say, the mind, is of necessity tranquil. And, again, as musical instruments are transposed and
 adapted to an infinite number of mixtures of airs, so also speech corresponds to them, becoming
 an interpreter of things; (109) for who would converse in a similar manner with parents and
 children, being by nature the slave of the one, and by birth the master of the others? And who,
 again, would talk in the same manner to brothers or cousins; or, in short, to near and to distant
 relations? Who, again, could do so to friends and to strangers, to fellow citizens and to foreigners,
 though there may be no great difference in point of fortune, or nature, or age between them? For
 one must behave differently while associating with an old man and with a young one; and, again,
 with a man of high reputation and a humble man, with a servant and a master; and, again, with a
 woman and a man, and with an illiterate and a clever man. (110) And why need one cite an
 incredible variety of persons to whom speech varies itself, so as at one time to assume one
 character and at another time another? For it would not interpret great things and small, numerous
 things and rare, private and public matters, sacred and profane affairs, or old and new events in
 the same manner; but would use, in each case, language appropriate to the number, or
 importance, or magnitude of the affairs under discussion; at one time elevating itself to a lofty style,
 and at another time, on the contrary, confining and humbling itself. (111) But as circumstances and
 persons give varieties to speech, so also do the causes of things and the manner in which they
 are done; and, moreover, those points especially with which everything is concerned, namely, time
 and place. Very beautifully, therefore, is he who inclines voices, namely Jubal, called "the father of
 the psaltery and of the harp," from a portion of the whole science of music, as has been shown
 already.
<p>
 XXXIII. (112) The descendants, therefore, of Adah, and what she herself is, have now been
 explained. Let us consider next the other wife of Lamech, Zillah, and what she brings forth. Zillah,
 then, being interpreted, means "shadow," a symbol of the equalities of the body and of the external
 good things, which, in their real essence, are in no way better than a shadow. Is not beauty a
 shadow, which, after it has flourished for a brief time, withers away? And are not strength and
 activity of body shadows, which any chance disease can destroy? And the organs of the external
 senses, and the accuracy of their use, which any sudden cold may obstruct, or old age, that
 inevitable and common disease of all men, may impair, are not they shadows? And, again, are not
 riches and glory, and authority and honours, and all the external circumstances which are
 accounted goods, are not they, I say, all shadows? (113) But one ought to lead the mind, as if by
 the steps of a flight of stairs, up to the origin of everything. Men in the rank of those who are
 considered illustrious have gone to Delphi, who have consecrated their happy lives to the service
 of that place, and like writings which have become effaced, not only in consequence of the lapse of
 ages but also by the vicissitudes which time brings bout, they have then expired [...]{46}{there is an
 hiatus in the text in this sentence. I have followed Mangey's Latin translation.} There are some again whom the
 impetuosity of an overflowing torrent, as it were, has suddenly extinguished and carried away.
 (114) From all these shadows, then, and all these unsubstantial dreams a son is born, whom his
 parents called Tubal (this name being interpreted means "all"). For they with great wisdom laying it
 down (instead of those things which are accounted good things by the multitude) that competency
 combined with good health is happiness, consider that in that is united everything great or small, in
 short everything. (115) But if there were any such thing as an absolutely independent authority
 added, then becoming full of arrogant domination, and elated with vanity and false opinions,
 forgetting themselves and the contemptible material of which they are composed, they look upon
 themselves as composed of a more valuable material than the composition of man admits of; and
 becoming swollen with pride, they think themselves worthy of even divine honours. At all events,
 before now some persons have ventured to say, that they "do not know the true God,"{47}{exodus
 5:2.} forgetting their own human nature, by reason of the immoderate excess of corporeal and
 external things [...] and each imagining [...]{48}{another hiatus occurs here.}
<p>
 XXXIV. (116) Then Moses says, "He was a hammer-beater and forger of brass and
 Iron:"{49}{#ge 4:22, where he is called Tubalcain.} for the soul of that man who is intent on corporeal
 pleasures or external things is beaten by a hammer, like apiece of iron on an anvil, being drawn out
 according to the long and thin-drawn extensions of the appetites. Accordingly, you may see men
 fond of their bodies at every time, and in every place laying lines and nets to catch those objects
 that they desire; and others, who are lovers of money or covetous of glory, letting loose their
 desire and eagerness for those things to the furthest boundaries of earth and sea, and dragging in
 from all quarters by their unlimited desires, as if by so many nets, whatever can gratify them, till the
 excessive tension, being broken by its great violence, drags back those who are dragging at it, and
 throws them down headlong. (117) All these men are causes of war, on account of which they are
 said to be workers in brass and iron, by means of which metals wars are carried on. For if any one
 contemplates the history of the greatest public or private quarrels that have arisen among men and
 among cities, he will not be wrong if [...]{50}{here again there is an hiatus in the text.} he looks upon all of
 them, whether upon those which took place long ago, or upon those which are now raging, or on all
 that will ever arise hereafter, as being caused either by the beauty of a woman, or by a love of
 money, or, in short, by some desire for the excessive indulgence of the body, and for some
 superfluity of external things: (118) but no foreign war and no civil war has ever existed for the
 sake of instruction or virtue, which are the good things of the mind, which is the best part of us; for
 these things are in their nature peaceful, and by them good laws and tranquil stability, and whatever
 else is most beautiful to the sharpseeing eyes of the soul, not to the dim perceptions of the body,
 are seen to be established. For the perceptive powers of the body look only upon the external
 surface, but the eye of the mind penetrates within, and going deep down surveys all the interior and
 hidden things which are removed out of the reach of bodily sight. (119) And nearly all the troubles,
 and confusions, and enmities which arise among men, are about absolutely nothing, but about what
 is really a shadow: for Moses called Tubal the son of Zillah, that is to say of shadow, the maker of
 the warlike instruments of brass and iron, speaking philosophically, and being guided not by verbal
 technicalities, but by the exceeding propriety of the names; for he knew that every naval and every
 land expedition chooses to encounter the greatest dangers for the sake of bodily pleasures, or
 with a view to obtain a superfluity of external good things, of which nothing is firm or solid, as is
 testified by the history of time, which brings all things to proof: for they are like superficial sketches,
 being in themselves perishable and of no duration.
<p>
 XXXV. (120) Moses proceeds to say, that Tubal's sister was Noeman, the interpretation of which
 name is "fatness." For it follows that those who pursue a luxurious condition of the body, and the
 other objects which I have mentioned, do get fat when they obtain any of the things that they desire:
 but such fatness as this I lay down as not strength but weakness; for it teaches a man to depart
 from the honour due to God, which is the first and most excellent power of the soul: (121) and the
 law is a witness to this which in the great hymn speaks thus--"He was fat, he was rich, he was
 exceeding broad, and he forsook God who had made him, and he forgot God his
 Saviour."{51}{#de 32:15.} For in truth those men whose lives have been exceedingly fortunate
 and are so at the time, do not remember the eternal God, but they think time their god; (122) on
 which account Moses bears witness, exhorting us to war against the contrary opinions, for he
 says, "The time has departed from them, and the Lord is among Us."{52}{#nu 14:9.} So that those
 men by whom the life of the soul is honoured, have divine reason dwelling among them, and walking
 with them; but those who pursue a life of pleasure have only a brief and fictitious want of
 opportunities: these men, therefore, having swollen extravagantly, and become enormously
 distended by their profuse fatness and luxury, have burst asunder. But the others, being made fat
 by that wisdom which nourishes the souls that love virtue, have a firm and unshaken power, a
 specimen of which is the fat which is sacrificed as a whole burnt-offering from every victim: (123)
 for Moses says, "All the fat shall belong to the Lord by the everlasting Law;"{53}{#le 3:16.} so that
 the fat of the mind is offered up to God and is appropriated to him, owing to which it is made
 immortal; but the fat which clings to the body and belongs to external things is referred to time,
 which is contrary to God, through which it very rapidly wastes away.
<p>
 XXXVI. (124) Therefore, concerning the wives of Lamech and his children, I think that enough has
 been said. Let us now consider what we may look upon as the resurrection of Abel, who was
 treacherously slain. Moses tells us, "And Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and brought
 forth a son, and he called his name Seth; for, said he, "God has raised me up another seed
 instead of Abel, whom Cain Slew."{54}{#ge 4:25.} The interpretation of the name Seth, is
 "irrigation." (125) As, therefore, the seeds and plants which are put into the ground grow and
 blossom through being irrigated, and are thus made fertile for the production of fruits, but if they
 are deprived of moisture they wither away, so likewise the soul, as it appears when it is watered
 with the wholesome stream of wisdom, shoots forth, and brings fruit to perfection. (126) Now,
 irrigation may be looked upon in a two-fold light: with regard to that which irrigates, and with regard
 to that which is irrigated. And might one not say that each of the outward senses is irrigated by the
 mind as by a fountain, which widens and extends all their faculties, as if they were so many
 channels for water? No one, therefore, in his senses would say, that the eyes see, but that the
 mind sees by means of the eyes; or that the ears hear, but that the mind hears by the
 instrumentality of the ears; or that the nostrils smell, but that the predominant part of man smells
 through the medium of the nostrils.
<p>
 XXXVII. (127) On which account it is said in Genesis, "And a fountain went up from the earth, and
 watered all the face of the Earth."{55}{#ge 2:6.} For since nature has allotted the most excellent
 portion of the whole body, namely the face, to the outward senses, therefore the fountain which
 goes up from the superior part, being diffused over various parts, and sending up its streams like
 so many watercourses as high as the face, by their means conducts the faculties to each of the
 organs of the outwards senses. In this way in truth, it is that the word of God irrigates the virtues;
 for that is the beginning and the fountain of all good actions. (128) And the lawgiver shows this,
 when he says, "And a river went out of Eden to water the Paradise; and from thence it is divided
 into four Heads."{56}{#ge 2:10.} For there are four generic virtues: prudence, courage,
 temperance, and justice. And of these, every single one is a princess and a ruler; and he who has
 acquired them is, from the moment of the acquisition, a ruler and a king, even if he has no
 abundance of any kind of treasure; (129) for the meaning of the expression, "it is divided into four
 heads," is [...]{57}{here again is an hiatus, which Mangey does not attempt to supply.} nor distance; but virtue
 exhibits the pre-eminence and the power. And these spring from the word of God as from one root,
 which he compares to a river, on account of the unceasing and everlasting flow of salutary words
 and doctrines, by which it increases and nourishes the souls that love God.
<p>
 XXXVIII. (130) And of what kind they are, he proceeds to show in a few words, deriving his
 explanation from the natural things of art; for he introduces Agar as filling a leathern bag with water,
 and giving her child Drink.{58}{#ge 21:19.} Now Agar is the handmaid of Sarah, the new
 dispensation of perfect virtue; and she is correctly represented so. Since, therefore, having come
 to the depth of knowledge, which Moses here calls a well, she draws up (filling the soul as if it were
 a vessel) the doctrines and speculations which she is in pursuit of, wishing to feed her child on the
 things on which she herself is fed. (131) And Moses, by her child, means, a soul which has lately
 learnt to desire instruction, and which has, in a manner, just been born to learn. In reference to
 which, the boy, when he has grown up to man's estate, becomes a sophist, whom Moses calls an
 archer; {59}{#ge 21:20.} for whatever argument he applies his mind to, at that, as at a target, he
 shoots all his reasons, as an archer shoots his arrows.
<p>
 XXXIX. (132) But Rebekkah is found to give her pupil drink no longer by improvement, but by
 perfection. How so the law will tell us: "For the damsel," says Moses, "was very beautiful to the
 sight, and was a maiden; no man had known her. And when he had gone down to the fountain, she
 filled her pitcher, and came up again; and the servant ran forward to meet her, and said, Give me
 now to drink a little water from thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord. And she made haste, and
 took down the pitcher on her arm, and gave to him to drink until he ceased drinking, And said, and I
 will also give to thy camels to drink, until they have all drunk; and she made haste, and emptied her
 pitcher into the trough, and running to the well, she drew water for the Camels."{60}{#ge 24:16.}
 (133) Here who can help wondering at the minute accuracy of the lawgiver as to every particular?
 He calls Rebekkah a maiden, and a very beautiful maiden, because the nature of virtue is unmixed
 and free from guile, and unpolluted, and the only thing in all creation which is both beautiful and
 good; from which arose the Stoic doctrine, that the only thing that was beautiful was the good.
<p>
 XL. (134) Now of the four virtues, some are always virgins, and some from having been women
 become changed into virgins, as Sarah did; "For it had ceased to be with her after the manner of
 Women,"{61}{#ge 18:11.} when she began to conceive her happy offspring Isaac. But that which is
 always a virgin, is that of which Moses says, "And no man whatever knows her." For in truth, it is
 not permitted to any mortal to pollute incorruptible nature, nor even clearly to comprehend what it is.
 If indeed he were able by any means to become acquainted with it, he would not cease to hate and
 regret it; (135) on which account Moses, in strict accordance with the principles of natural
 philosophy, represents Leah as Hated.{62}{#ge 29:31.} For those whom the charms of pleasures,
 which are with Rachel, that is to say, with the outward sense, cannot be endured by Leah, who is
 situated out of the reach of the passions; on which account they repudiate and detest her. But as
 far as she herself is concerned, her alienation from the creature produces her a close connection
 with God, from whom she receives the seeds of wisdom, and conceives, and travails, and brings
 forth virtuous ideas, worthy of the father who begot them. If therefore, you, O my soul, imitating
 Leah, reject mortal things, you will of necessity turn to the incorruptible God, who will shed over you
 all the fountains of his good.
<p>
 XLI. (136) "But Rebekkah," says Moses, "went down to the fountain to fill her pitcher, and came up
 again." For from what source is it natural for the mind that thirsts after wisdom to be filled, except
 from the wisdom of God, that fountain which never fails, and to which the soul that descends
 comes up again like a virtuous disciple? For those who descend out of a vain pride, the reason of
 virtue receives, and taking them up by means of fame raises them to a height. On which account it
 is that Moses seems to me to use the expression, "Go, descend, and come Up,"{63}{#ex 32:7.} as
 if every one who measures his own loveliness comes forth more gloriously in the eyes of the
 judges of truth. And he speaks of these matters with great caution. (137) For Agar bears a
 leathern bag to the well, but Rebekkah carries a pitcher. For the one who devotes himself to
 instruction and to the energetical branches of learning has need of some incorporeal things as it
 were of the outward senses, of vessels, and eyes, and ears, for a proper contemplation of the
 objects of her speculation. For from seeing many things and hearing many things, there is derived,
 in the case of those who are fond of learning the advantage which proceeds from knowledge. But
 the one who is filled with unalloyed wisdom has need only of a leathern habitation, which is no
 better than none at all. For the soul which loves unsubstantial things has learnt to put off the whole
 leathern bag of reasons, that is to say the body, and brings only a pitcher which is the symbol of a
 vessel, which contains the principal portion in great size and abundance, like water; as to which,
 those who are clever in such matters may make it a subject of philosophical speculation, whether it
 is a membrane or a heart. (138) Therefore, the man who is fond of learning, seeing men imbibing
 the sciences like water, from wisdom that divine fountain, runs up, and meeting them becomes a
 suppliant to them to know how he may allay his thirst for learning. And the soul which has received
 the best possible education, namely, the lesson not to envy, and to be liberal, immediately proffers
 to him the stream of wisdom, and invites him to drink abundantly, adding also this that she calls him
 who is only a servant her lord. This is the meaning of that most dogmatic assertion, that the wise
 man alone is free, and a king, even if he have ten thousand masters over his body.
<p>
 XLII. (139) Most correctly, therefore, after the servant has said, "Give me a little water to drink,"
 does she make answer, not in the manner corresponding to his request: "I will give you to drink,"
 but "Drink." For the one expression would have been suited to one who was displaying the riches
 of God, which are poured forth for all who are worthy of them and who are able to think of them; but
 the other expression is appropriate to one who professes that she will teach. But nothing which is
 connected with mere professions is akin to virtue. (140) But he describes in a most skilful manner
 the language used by her who teaches and benefits her pupils. For "she made haste," he says,
 "and took down the pitcher on her arm." Her alacrity to serve the man was displayed by her making
 haste, and such alacrity is seated in the mind, beyond which envy is cast away. But by the
 expression, "taking down the pitcher on her arm," we see intimated the prompt and eager attention
 of the teacher to the pupil; (141) for those teachers are foolish who attempt to regulate their
 explanations not by a reference to the capacity of their pupils, but to their own superior ability, not
 being aware that there is a vast difference between making a display and giving a lesson. For he
 who is making a display, relying on the good fortune of his present way of proceeding, brings into
 sight, without any trouble, the works at which he has for a long while been labouring at home, like
 the works of painters or sculptors, seeking for praise from the multitude. But he who is
 endeavouring to teach others, like a good physician, has a regard not to the greatness of his own
 skill, but to the capacity of his patient who is to be healed; not thinking how much he can do by his
 art, for it is unspeakable how much this may be; but what the patient requires, aiming at
 moderation, and bringing forward what may improve him.
<p>
 XLIII. (142) On which account Moses says in another passage, "Thou shalt lend a loan to him who
 asks you for one, as much as he requires, having regard to what he Requires."{64}{#de 15:8.}
 By the second phrase showing that it is not everything which is to be given, but only such things as
 are suitable to the requirements of those who are asking for them. For to give an anchor, or an
 oar, or a rudder to a husbandman, or ploughs or a spade to a captain of a ship, or a lyre to a
 physician, or instruments suited to manual labour to a musician, would be ridiculous, unless indeed
 one ought to offer a thirsty man costly viands, or a hungry man unmixed wine in abundance, so as
 to show at once one's own riches and one's want of humanity, by turning the souls of one's
 companions into ridicule. The quantity to be given in an act of beneficence is defined according to
 due proportion, which is a most useful thing. For, says Moses, do not give all that right reason is
 able to give, but as much as he who is asking the loan is worthy to receive. (143) Do you not see
 that even God does not utter his oracles, having a regard to their being in proportion to the
 magnitude of his own oracular power, but always having respect to the capacity of those who are
 to be benefited by them? Since who could receive the whole power of the words of God, which are
 too mighty for any one to listen to? On which account those persons appear to speak with great
 truth, who say to Moses, "Do thou speak to us, and let not God speak to us, lest we Die."{65}{exodus
 20:19.} For they know that they have not in themselves any organ which can be worthy of God who
 is giving laws to his church; (144) nor, indeed, could even the whole world, both land and sea,
 contain his riches if he were inclined to display them, unless we think that the descent of the rains
 and of the other things that happen in the world are appointed to take place according to the
 pre-arranged periods of the seasons, and not all at once, because of the scarcity and rarity of the
 things themselves, and not from any regard to the advantage of those who are benefited by them;
 who would be injured rather than be benefited by a continual enjoyment of such gifts. (145) On this
 account it is, that God always judiciously limits and brings out with wise moderation his first
 benefits, stopping them before those who partake of them become wanton through satiety; and
 then he bestows others in their stead; and again a third class of advantages instead of the second
 set, and so on, continually substituting new blessings for those of older date, at one time giving
 such as are different from those which went before, and at another time such as are almost
 identical with them; for the creature is never wholly destitute of the blessings bestowed by God,
 since if he were he would be utterly destroyed; but he is unable to endure an unlimited and
 measureless abundance of them. On which account, as he is desirous that we should derive
 advantage from the benefits which he bestows upon us, he weighs out what he gives so as to
 proportion it to the strength of those who receive it.
<p>
 XLIV. (146) Rebekkah, therefore, must be praised, who, in obedience to the injunctions of her
 father, having taken down the vessel of wisdom on her arm from a higher place, proffered her
 pitcher to the disciple; by the pitcher being understood that teaching which he is competent to
 receive. (147) And beyond all other things, I especially admire her exceeding liberality; for though
 she had only been asked for a small draught, she gave a large one, until she had filled the whole
 soul of the learner with wholesome speculations. For Moses says, "She gave him to drink till he
 ceased from drinking," a most marvellous example to teach us humanity. For if any one should not
 happen to be in want of many things, but should come forward, and out of shame ask only for a
 very little, let us not give him only what he mentions, but also those things of which he makes no
 mention, but of which he is nevertheless in reality in need. (148) But it is not sufficient for the
 complete enjoyment of his teacher's lessons, that the disciple should merely comprehend what the
 master has taught him, unless he has also got memory. On which account, making a display of her
 bounteous disposition, when he has satisfied himself with the water, she offers to give his camels
 water also, which we have already said are here put symbolically for memory. For the animal while
 eating its food ruminates, and when, having stooped down it has received a heavy burden, with
 exceedingly great vigour of muscle it rises up lightly; (149) and in the same manner also, the soul
 of the man who is devoted to learning, when the burden of its speculations is placed upon it,
 becomes more lowly, and when it has risen up it rejoices; and from that mastication, and as it were
 the softening, of the first food that is placed down before it, arises its memory of those
 speculations. (150) But she, beholding the nature of the servant to be well calculated for the
 reception of virtue, emptied her whole pitcher into the cistern, that is to say, she emptied the whole
 knowledge of the teacher into the soul of the learner. For the sophists, from a desire of gain and
 also from envy, repressing the natural characters of their pupils, keep silence about many things
 which ought to be mentioned, laying up for themselves a source of gain for future times. (151) But
 virtue is an ungrudging and most liberal feeling, so that it does not hesitate to assist another with
 hand and foot, as the proverb goes, and with all its power. Therefore, pouring all that she knew into
 the mind of the pupil as into a cistern, she went again to the well to draw water, that is to say, she
 went to the ever-flowing wisdom of God, that what had been already imparted might be firmly fixed
 in by memory, and that he might also be irrigated with the knowledge of other and newer things. For
 the wealth of the wisdom of God is illimitable, and as a tree which is continually putting forth new
 shoots after the old ones, so that it never ceases growing young again, and being in the flower of
 its strength. (152) So that they are marvellously simple people who have ever had an idea of
 coming to the end of any branch of knowledge whatever. For that which has seemed to be near
 and within reach is nevertheless a long way distant from the end; since no created being is perfect
 in any department of learning, but falls as far short of it as a thoroughly infant child just beginning to
 learn does, in comparison of a man who both by age and skill is qualified to be a master.
<p>
 XLV. (153) And we must inquire the cause why the handmaid gave the servant drink from the
 fountain, but gave the camels water from the well. May it not perhaps be that the stream here
 signifies the sacred scripture itself, which irrigates the sciences, and that the well is rather akin to
 memory? For the depths which he has already mentioned, he produces by means of memory as it
 were out of a well; (154) and such persons as these one ought to admit because of the goodness
 of their natural disposition. But there are some men among those who practise virtue to whom the
 all-beneficent God has shown the way that leads to virtue, such that at first it is accounted rough,
 and steep, and difficult, but subsequently level and easy, having changed the bitterness of the
 wayfarer's labour to sweetness. And how he has wrought this change we will now tell. (155) When
 he led us forth out of Egypt, that is to say, out of the passions which excite the body, we, travelling
 in the desert, that is to say, in the path of pleasure, encamped in the place called Marah, a place
 which had no drinkable water, but where all the water was Bitter.{66}{#ex 15:23.} For still the
 pleasures which are brought into action by means of the eyes, and ears, and belly, and the parts
 adjacent to the belly, were tempting to us, and charmed us exceedingly, sounding close to us. (156)
 When, therefore, we desired to be entirely separated from them, they dragged us back, exerting
 themselves in opposition to us, and entwining themselves round us, and soothing us with all kinds
 of juggling tricks and assiduous blandishments; so that we, yielding to their unremitting caresses,
 became alienated from and disinclined to labour, as something very bitter and intolerable, and
 designed to run back again to Egypt, that is to say, to the condition of an intemperate and
 lascivious life, if the Saviour had not speedily taken pity on us, and thrown a sweetening branch like
 a medicine upon our soul, causing it to love labour instead of hating it. (157) For he knew,
 inasmuch as he was our Creator, that we could not possibly survive any existing thing unless there
 were in us an intense love of doing so. Therefore, men never succeed in attaining any object that
 they desire if they pursue it without any connection with or consideration of fitness. But when
 friendship is added, and also a familiarity with the loved object, their endeavours then succeed
 rightly.
<p>
 XLVI. (158) This is the food of a soul which is inclined to the practice of virtue, to consider labour a
 very sweet thing instead of a bitter one, which, however, it is not allowed to all persons to
 participate in; but to those only by whom the golden calf, the animal made by the Egyptians, the
 body, is sprinkled over with water after having been burnt with fire, and broken to pieces. For it is
 said in the sacred scriptures, that "Moses having taken the calf burnt it with fire, and broke it up into
 small pieces, and threw the pieces into the water and caused the children of Israel to drink
 Thereof."{67}{#ex 32:20.} (159) For the love of virtue being inflamed and excited by the brilliant
 appearance of virtue, burns to ashes the pleasures of the body, and then cuts them to pieces and
 pounds them to nothing, using the divine word which can at all times divide everything. And in this
 manner he teaches us that among the bodily advantages are health, and beauty, and the accuracy
 of the outward senses, and the perfection of bodily vigour with strength and mighty energy; but still
 that all these things are common to accursed and wicked persons, while if they were really good no
 wicked person would be allowed to partake of them. (160) But these men, even if they are utterly
 wicked, still, inasmuch as they are men, and so far partake of the same human nature as virtuous
 men, do also partake of these advantages of the body. And, in fact, at present those wild beasts
 which are the most untameable, enjoy these good things, if indeed they are in reality good things, in
 a greater degree than rational beings; (161) for what wrestler could be compared in might with the
 strength of a bull or of an elephant? And what runner could put himself on a level with the speed of
 a hound or of a hare? And the most sharp-sighted of men is absolutely blind if his sight is
 compared with that of antelopes of eagles. Again, in hearing and in smell, often other animals are
 very far beyond man; as, for instance, the ass, which appears to be the stupidest of all animals,
 would show that our sense of hearing is very obtuse if he were brought into comparison with us.
 The dog, too, would make the nostrils in man appear a perfectly useless part from the exceeding
 superiority of the quickness of his own sense of smell; for, in him, that sense is pushed to such a
 degree that it almost equals the rapidity of the eye-sight.
<p>
 XLVII. (162) And why need I dwell on the subject more, going through each of the senses and
 animals separately? For this point has been long agreed upon among all the most eminent
 historians and philosophers, who have all said that nature is the mother of the irrational animals,
 and the stepmother of men, perceiving the bodily weakness of men, and the surpassing strength of
 brute animals in everything. With great propriety, therefore, the artist pounded the calf to pieces;
 that is to say, dividing it into parts, he showed that all the things which the body has in abundance
 are very far removed from real good, and are in no respect different from those things which are
 scattered on the water. (163) On which account the scripture tells us that the calf, after having
 been pounded to pieces, was scattered on the water, to signify that no genuine plant of good can
 ever flourish in corruptible matter; for as a seed, when thrown into the stream of a river or into the
 sea, cannot display its proper powers; for it is impossible, unless it has once taken hold with its
 roots, as with anchors, of some firm portion of earth, that any branch should be firmly fixed or
 should shoot up, I do not say to any height, but even as a creeper along the ground, or that it
 should ever bring forth fruit at the periodical seasons of the year, for any great and violent rush of
 water coming on washes away all the germinating vigour of the seed. In the same manner all the
 superfluities contained in the vessel of the soul which are ever spoken of or celebrated are
 destroyed before they can have any existence, the corporeal substance continually flowing off
 from them. (164) For how can there be such things as disease and old age and all kinds of
 corruptions, if there were not a continual drawing off of words, which are theoretical streams; the
 hierophant, therefore, thinks it Right{68}{i have followed Mangey here in reading axioi, instead of apaxioi, though
 he prints the latter in the text as the reading of all the MSS.} to irrigate our minds with these words, for the
 sake of burning up the pleasures, of pounding to pieces and reducing to a thin and impalpable dust,
 and utterly destroying the system of the corporeal goods; and of making us recollect that the true
 good has never at any time germinated or blossomed from any one of them, just as nothing
 flourishes from seeds which are sown in water.
<p>
 XLVIII. (165) But bulls, and rams, and goats, which Egypt holds in honour, and all other images of
 corruptible matter which, in report alone, are accounted God's, have no real existence, but are all
 fictitious and false; for those who look upon life as only a tragedy full of acts of arrogance and
 stories of love, impressing false ideas on the tender minds of young men, and using the ears as
 their ministers, into which they pour fabulous trifles, waste away and corrupt their minds, compelling
 them to look upon persons who were never even men in their minds, but always effeminate
 creatures as God's; (166) for the calf was not made of every description of female ornament, but
 only of the earrings of the women. The lawgiver showing us by this that nothing wrought with hands
 is a visible and true God, but only so by report, and as far as he is thought so, and that, too, the
 report of a woman and not of a man; for it is the conduct of a soul utterly enervated and rendered
 completely effeminate to receive such nonsense. (167) But he who is truly God is perceived, and
 felt, and recognised, not only by means of one's ears, but also by the eyes of our mind, through his
 mighty works which are done in the world, and through the rapidity of his operations; on which
 account in the great song it is said (the speaker assuming the character of God), "Behold! behold!
 it is I!"{69}{#de 32:39.} as if that real existing God could be more easily conceived by the mind
 than proved by verbal demonstration; (168) but it is not correct to say that the living God is visible,
 that is rather an abuse of language, arising from referring God himself to his separate acts of
 power; for even in the passage cited above, he does not say, "Behold me," for it is wholly
 impossible that God according to his essence should be perceived or beheld by any creature, but
 he says, "Behold! it is I," that is to say, behold my existence; for it is sufficient for the reasoning
 powers of man to advance so far as to learn that there is and actually exists the great cause of all
 things, and to attempt to proceed further, so as to pursue investigations into the essence or
 distinctive qualities of God, is an absolute piece of folly; (169) for God did not grant this even to the
 all-wise Moses; not though he addressed innumerable requests to him, all having this object; but an
 oracle was delivered to him, telling him, "Thou shalt see my back parts, but my face thou shalt not
 See;"{70}{#ex 33:23.} and the meaning of this is, that all the things which are behind God are within
 the comprehension of a virtuous man, but he himself alone is incomprehensible; and he is
 incomprehensible by any direct and immediate access (for by such means it is only explained what
 kind of being he is), but he may be understood in his subsequent and consistent faculties; for they,
 by means of the works accomplished by them, declare not his essence, but his existence.
<p>
 XLIX. (170) Therefore the mind having generated the foundation of good [...]{71}{there is again an
 hiatus in the text here. Mangey conjectures diagoges, "way of life," to be the word which has fallen out.} and the
 primary principle of virtue, namely Seth, or irrigation, boasts with an honourable and holy boast; for
 she says, "God has raised up to me another seed, instead of Abel whom Cain Slew,"{72}{genesis
 4:25.} for it has been said with great exactness and neatness, that no single divine seed ever falls to
 the ground, but that they all rise up from the things of earth, and leave them, and are borne
 upwards to heaven; (171) but the seeds which are sown by mortals, whether for the generation of
 animals or of plants, do not all come to perfection; but we must be content if more are not wasted
 than those which remain above; and God sows nothing in our souls which is incomplete; but his
 seed is all so seasonable and so perfect that every one of them is at once borne forward to
 produce abundance of its appropriate fruit.
<p>
 L. (172) But when Moses says here that Seth sprung up as another or different seed, he does not
 say from which it was different; was it different from Abel who was treacherously slain, or from
 Cain who slew him? But may we not say perhaps that the original seed from which each of these
 sprung was different? That from which Cain sprung, inasmuch as it was hostile; for a thirst for
 virtue is the most hostile thing possible to that deserter, wickedness; that from which Abel sprung,
 as friendly and kindred; for that which is beginning to exist is a different thing from, but not a
 contrary thing to, that which is perfected; and so that which pertains to creation is different from
 that which pertains to the uncreate. (173) On this account Abel, after having quitted the mortal
 body, departed to the better nature, and took up his abode with that. But Seth, as being the seed of
 human virtue, will never quit the race of mankind. But first of all he will receive his growth up to the
 number ten, that perfect number, according to which the just Noah exists; and then he will receive a
 second and a better growth from his son Shem, ending in a second ten, from which the faithful
 Abraham is named. And he will also have a third growth, and one more perfect than the number
 ten, extending from him to Moses, that man who is wise in all things, for he is the seventh from
 Abraham, not revolving, like an initiated worshipper, in the circle which is exterior to holy things, but
 like a hierophant, making his abode in the inmost shrines.
<p>
 LI. (174) And consider the advances towards improvement made by the soul of the man who is
 eager for, and insatiable in, his craving after good things; and the illimitable riches of God, who
 gives the end of some things to be the beginnings of others; for the end of the knowledge which is
 according to Seth is the beginning of the just Noah; and his perfection again is the beginning of the
 education of Abraham; and the most perfect wisdom of Abraham is the first instruction of Moses;
 (175) and the two daughters of Lot, the man who was subdued and overthrown by the weakness of
 the soul, namely, intention and agreement, desire to become pregnant by the mind, that is to say,
 by their father, acting in opposition to him who said, "God has raised up for me ..."{73}{#ge 19:32.}
 For that which the living God did for him, this they affirm that the mind is able to do for them,
 introducing the doctrine of an intoxicated and frenzied soul. It is indeed the act of sober reason,
 both to confess that God is the Creator and the Father of the universe; and the conduct of one
 utterly fallen in intoxication and drunkenness, to fancy that he himself is the bringer about of each
 of human affairs. (176) Evil opinions therefore will not come into association with their father,
 before a great quantity of the unmixed wine of folly has been found upon him, and destroyed any
 sense that may have previously been in him; for it is written, "They made their father drink wine."
 So that if they do not give him drink, they will never receive legitimate seed from him while he is
 sober; but when he has been soaked in wine, and has become utterly intoxicated and senseless,
 then they will become pregnant, and have a culpable labour and offspring, which will be truly
 accursed.
<p>
 LII. (177) On which account Moses has separated his impious and obscure progeny from the
 whole of the divine company; for he says, "The Ammonites and the Moabites shall not come into
 the assembly of the Lord:"{74}{#de 23:3.} and these are the descendants of the daughters of
 Lot, supposing that everything is generated of the outward sense and of mind, being male and
 female like a father and mother, and looking upon this as in real truth the cause of all generation:
 (178) but as, even if we were to commit such an error as this, still emerging as it were out of that
 troubled sea, we may lay hold on repentance, which is a firm and saving thing, and must never let it
 go till we have completely escaped from the billowy sea, the headlong violence of sin: (179) as
 Rachel, when formerly praying for mind, as if that were able to raise up children, and when she
 received the answer, "Am I equal to God?"{75}{#ge 30:2.} attended to what was said to her, and
 when she understood it, made a most pious recantation; for the recantation of Rachel is recorded
 in scripture, a most God-loving prayer, "May God grant to me another Son,"{76}{#ge 30:24.} such
 a prayer as no foolish person is permitted to make, who pursues no object but his own pleasure,
 and who thinks everything else mere folly and ridiculousness.
<p>
 LIII. (180) And the leader of this opinion is Onan the brother of the skin-wearing Er. "For he," says
 the scripture, "knowing that the seed would not be his, when he went in unto his brother's wife,
 spilled his seed upon the Ground:"{77}{#ge 38:9.} he transgressed all the boundaries of self-love
 and of fondness for pleasure. (181) Should I not say to this man, If you have a regard to your own
 advantage you will destroy everything that is excellent, and that too without deriving any advantage
 therefrom? You will put an end to the honour due to parents, the attention of a wife, the education
 of children, the blameless services of servants, the management of a house, the government of a
 city, the firm establishment of laws, the guardianship of morals, reverence to one's elders, the habit
 of speaking well of the dead, good fellowship with the living, piety towards God as shown both in
 words and in deeds: for you are overturning and throwing into confusion all these things, sowing
 seed for yourself alone, and nursing up pleasure, that gluttonous intemperate origin of all evil.
<p>
 LIV. (182) From which that priest and servant of the only good God, Phineas, rising up{78}{--that wise
 regulator of all the corporeal words and expressions, so as never to behave erroneously or insolently through the medium
 of them; for the interpretation of the name Phineas is "the bridle of the mouth"--}having taken a coadjutor, that is
 to say, having inquired into and examined the nature of things, and having found that nothing is
 more honourable than virtue, stabbed and slew with a sword the creature devoted to pleasure, and
 hostile to virtue, and all the places from which all false and illegitimate delights and enjoyments
 spring: (183) for the law says that, "He thrust the woman through her belly." Thus, therefore, having
 caused the difference that existed in him to cease, and having discarded his own pleasure, and
 burning with zeal for God, the First Cause and holy God, he was honoured and crowned with the
 two most valuable of all prizes, peace and the priesthood; with the one because both his name and
 his conduct are akin to peace: (184) for it follows of necessity that a consecrated mind, being its
 minister and servant, must do everything in which its master delights; and he delights in the firm
 establishment of good law, and tranquillity, and stability, and in the discarding of wars and
 [...]{79}{there is another hiatus here, which Mangey proposes to fill up with the words kai staseon, "and seditions."}
 meaning not only such as cities make upon one another, but also those which take place in the
 soul; and these are more important and more injurious, inasmuch as they injure the more divine
 portion of us, namely, our reason, while arms and weapons can only reach to the injury of our
 bodies or possessions, but have never any power to injure a healthy soul. (185) Rightly therefore
 have cities established a custom, that before they turn arms and engines of destruction against
 one another to lead to slavery and utter destruction, they should seek to persuade all the citizens
 to put An{80}{the text is corrupt here. The text has katages, a word manifestly mutilated. Mangey proposes
 katargesasthai, and translates it "ut tollerent."} end to the great and formidable and unceasing factions
 which exist in themselves, for faction and sedition, if we must speak the truth, is the archetypal
 model of wars, and if that be destroyed, there will no longer be any wars which are made in
 imitation of it; but the race of mankind will attain to the blessing and enjoyment of profound peace,
 being taught by the law of nature, that is, by virtue, to honour God, and to cleave to the employment
 of serving him, for this is the source of happiness and length of life.
