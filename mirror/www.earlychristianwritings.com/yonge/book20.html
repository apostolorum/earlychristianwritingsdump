 ON THE CHANGE OF NAMES*
<p>
<p>        {**Yonge's title, A Treatise on the Question Why Certain Names in the Holy Scripture Are Changed.}
<p>
   I. (1) "Abraham was ninety and nine years old; and the Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said
 unto him, I am thy God."{1}{#ge 17:1.} The number of nine, when added to the number ninety, is
 very near to a hundred; in which number the self-taught race shone forth, namely Isaac, the most
 excellent joy of all enjoyments; for he was born when his father was a hundred years old. (2)
 Moreover the first fruits of the tribe of Levi are given up to the priests; {2}{#nu 18:26.} for they
 having taken tithes, offer up other tenths from them as from their own fruits, which thus comprise
 the number of a hundred; for the number ten is the symbol of improvement, and the number a
 hundred is the symbol of perfection; and he that is in the middle is always striving to reach the
 extremity, exerting the inborn goodness of his nature, by which he says, that the Lord of the
 universe has appeared to him. (3) But do not thou think that this appearance presented itself to the
 eyes of the body, for they see no things but such as are perceptible to the outward senses; but
 those objects of the outward senses are compounded ones, full of destruction; but the Deity is not
 a compound object, and is indestructible: but the eye which receives the impression of the divine
 appearance is the eye of the soul; (4) for besides this, those things which it is only the eyes of the
 body that see, are only seen by them because they take light as a coadjutor, and light is different,
 both from the object seen and from the things which see it. But all these things which the soul sees
 of itself, and through its own power, it sees without the cooperation of any thing or any one else; for
 the things which the soul does thus comprehend are a light to themselves, (5) and in the same way
 also we learn the sciences; for the mind, applying its never-closing and never-slumbering eye to
 their doctrines and speculations, sees them by no spurious light, but by that genuine light which
 shines forth from itself. (6) When therefore you hear that God has been seen by man, you must
 consider that this is said without any reference to that light which is perceptible by the external
 senses, for it is natural that that which is appreciable only by the intellect should be presented to
 the intellect alone; and the fountain of the purest light is God; so that when God appears to the soul
 he pours forth his beams without any shade, and beaming with the most radiant brilliancy.
<p>
 II. (7) Do not, however, think that the living God, he who is truly living, is ever seen so as to be
 comprehended by any human being; for we have no power in ourselves to see any thing, by which
 we may be able to conceive any adequate notion of him; we have no external sense suited to that
 purpose (for he is not an object which can be discerned by the outward sense), nor any strength
 adequate to it: therefore, Moses, the spectator of the invisible nature, the man who really saw God
 (for the sacred scriptures say that he entered "into the Darkness,"{3}{#ex 20:21.} by which
 expression they mean figuratively to intimate the invisible essence), having investigated every part
 of every thing, sought to see clearly the much-desired and only God; (8) but when he found nothing,
 not even any appearance at all resembling what he had hoped to behold; he, then, giving up all idea
 of receiving instruction on that point from any other source, flies to the very being himself whom he
 was seeking, and entreats him, saying, "Show my thyself that I may see thee so as to know
 Thee."{4}{#ex 33:13.} But, nevertheless, he fails to obtain the end which he had proposed to
 himself, and which he had accounted the most all-sufficient gift for the most excellent race of
 creation, mankind, namely a knowledge of those bodies and things which are below the living God.
 (9) For it is said unto him, "Thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be beheld by
 Thee."{5}{#ex 33:23.} As if it were meant to answer him: Those bodies and things which are
 beneath the living God may come within thy comprehension, even though every thing would not be
 at once comprehended by thee, since that one being is not by his nature capable of being beheld
 by man. (10) And what wonder is there if the living God is beyond the reach of the comprehension
 of man, when even the mind that is in each of us is unintelligible and unknown to us? Who has ever
 beheld the essence of the soul? the obscure nature of which has given rise to an infinite number of
 contests among the sophists who have brought forward opposite opinions, some of which are
 inconsistent with any kind of nature. (11) It was, therefore, quite consistent with reason that no
 proper name could with propriety be assigned to him who is in truth the living God. Do you not see
 that to the prophet who is really desirous of making an honest inquiry after the truth, and who asks
 what answer he is to give to those who question him as to the name of him who has sent him, he
 says, "I am that I Am,"{6}{#ex 3:14.} which is equivalent to saying, "It is my nature to be, not to be
 described by name:" (12) but in order that the human race may not be wholly destitute of any
 appellation which they may give to the most excellent of beings, I allow you to use the word Lord as
 a name; the Lord God of three natures--of instruction, and of holiness, and of the practice of
 virtue; of which Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob are recorded as the symbols. For this, says he, is
 the everlasting name, as if it has been investigated and discerned in time as it exists in reference
 to us, and not in that time which was before all time; and it is also a memorial not placed beyond
 recollection or intelligence, and again it is addressed to persons who have been born, not to
 uncreated natures. (13) For these men have need of the complete use of the divine name who
 come to a created or mortal generation, in order that, if they cannot attain to the best thing, they
 may at least arrive at the best possible name, and arrange themselves in accordance with that;
 and the sacred oracle which is delivered as from the mouth of the Ruler of the universe, speaks of
 the proper name of God never having been revealed to any one, when God is represented as
 saying, "For I have not shown them my Name;"{7}{#ex 6:3.} for by a slight change in the figure of
 speech here used, the meaning of what is said would be something of this kind: "My proper name I
 have not revealed to them," but only that which is commonly used, though with some misapplication,
 because of the reasons abovementioned. (14) And, indeed, the living God is so completely
 indescribable, that even those powers which minister unto him do not announce his proper name to
 us. At all events, after the wrestling match in which the practicer of virtue wrestled for the sake of
 the acquisition of virtue, he says to the invisible Master, "Tell me thy Name;"{8}{#ge 32:29.} but he
 said, "Why askest thou me my name?" And he does not tell him his peculiar and proper name, for
 says he, it is sufficient for thee to be taught my ordinary explanations. But as for names which are
 the symbols of created things, do not seek to find them among immortal natures.
<p>
 III. (15) Therefore do not doubt either whether that which is more ancient than any existing thing is
 indescribable, when his very word is not to be mentioned by us according to its proper name. So
 that we must understand that the expression, "The Lord was seen by Abraham,"{9}{#ge 17:1.}
 means not as if the Cause of all things had shone forth and become visible, (for what human mind
 is able to contain the greatness of his appearance?) but as if some one of the powers which
 surround him, that is to say, his kingly power, had presented itself to the sight, for the appellation
 Lord belongs to authority and sovereignty. (16) But when our mind was occupied with the wisdom
 of the Chaldaeans, studying the sublime things which exist in the world, it made as it were the
 circuit of all the efficient powers as causes of what existed; but when it emigrated from the
 Chaldaean doctrines, it then knew that it was moving under the guidance and direction of a
 governor, of whose authority it perceived the appearance. (17) On which account it is said, "The
 Lord," not the living God, "was seen;" as if it had been meant to say, the king appeared, he who
 was from the beginning, but who was not as yet recognized by the soul, which, indeed, was late in
 learning, but which did not continue for ever in ignorance, but received a notion of there being an
 authority and governing power among existing things. (18) And when the ruler has appeared, then
 he in a still greater degree benefits his disciple and beholder, saying, "I am thy God;"{10}{genesis
 17:2.} for I should say to him, "What is there of all the things which form a part of creation of which
 thou art not the God?" But his word, which is his interpreter, will teach me that he is not at present
 speaking of the world, of which he is by all means the creator and the God, but about the souls of
 men, which he has thought worthy of a different kind of care; (19) for he thinks fit to be called the
 Lord and Master of bad men, but the God of those who are in a state of advancement and
 improvement; and of those which are the most excellent and the most perfect, both Lord and God
 at once. On which account, having made Pharaoh the very extreme instance of impiety, he has
 never once called himself his Lord or his God; but he calls the wise Moses so, for he says to him,
 "Behold I give thee as a god to Pharaoh."{11}{#ge 7:1.} But he has in many passages of the
 sacred oracles delivered by him, called himself Lord. (20) For instance, we read such as passage
 as this: "Thus says the Lord;"{12}{#ex 7:17.} and at the very beginning we read, "The Lord spake
 unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord, say unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all the things which I say
 unto Thee."{13}{#ex 6:29.} (21) And Moses, in another place, says, "Behold, when I go forth out of
 the city I will spread out my hands unto the Lord, and the sounds shall cease, and the hail, and
 there shall be no more rain, that thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord's;" that is to say, every
 thing that is made of body or of earth, "and that thou," that is the mind which bears in itself the
 images of things, "and thy servants," that is the particular reasonings which act as body-guards to
 the mind, "for I know that ye do not yet fear the Lord;"{14}{#ex 9:29.} by which he means not the
 Lord who is spoken of commonly and in different senses, but him who is truly the Master of all
 things. (22) For there is in truth no created Lord, not even a king shall have extended his authority
 and spread it from one end of the world even to the other end, but only the uncreated God, the real
 governor, whose authority he who reverences and fears receives a most beneficial reward,
 namely, the admonitions of God, but utterly miserable destruction awaits the man who despises
 him; (23) therefore he is held forth as the Lord of the foolish, striking them with a terror which is
 appropriate to him as ruler. But he is the God of those who are improved; as we read now, "I am
 thy God, I am thy God, be thou increased and Multiplied."{15}{#ge 17:1, also 35:2.} And in the case
 of those who are perfect, he is both together, both Lord and God; as we read in the ten
 commandments, "I am the Lord thy God."{16}{#ex 20:2.} And in another passage it is written, "The
 Lord God of our Fathers."{17}{#de 4:1.} (24) For he thinks it right for the wicked man to be
 governed by a master as by a lord; that, being in a state of alarm and groaning, he may have the
 fear of a master suspended over him; but him who is advancing in improvement he thinks
 deserving to receive benefits as from God in order that by means of these benefits he may arrive
 at perfection; and him who is complete and perfect he thinks should be both governed as by the
 Lord, and benefited as by God; for the last man remains for ever unchangeable, and he is, by all
 means and in all respects, the man of God: (25) and this is especially shown to be the fact in the
 case of Moses; for, says the scripture, "This is the blessing which Moses, the man of God,
 Blessed."{18}{#de 33:1.} O the man that thus thought worthy of this all-beautiful and sacred
 recompense, to give himself as a requital for the divine Providence! (26) But do not thou think that
 he is in the same sense a man and the man of God; for he is said to be a man as being a
 possession of God, but the man of God as boasting in and being benefited by him. And if thou
 wishest to have God as the inheritance of thy mind, then do thou in the first place labour to become
 yourself an inheritance worthy of him, and thou wilt be such if thou avoidest all laws made by hands
 and voluntary.
<p>
 IV. (27) But it is not right to be ignorant of this thing either, that the statement, "I am thy
 God,"{19}{#ge 17:1.} is made by a certain figurative misuse of language rather than with strict
 propriety; for the living God, inasmuch as he is living, does not consist in relation to anything; for he
 himself is full of himself, and he is sufficient for himself, and he existed before the creation of the
 world, and equally after the creation of the universe; (28) for he is immovable and unchangeable,
 having no need of any other thing or being whatever, so that all things belong to him, but, properly
 speaking, he does not belong to anything. And of the powers which he has extended towards
 creation for the advantage of the world which is thus put together, some are spoken of, as it were,
 in relation to these things; as for instance his kingly and his beneficent power; for he is the king of
 something, and the benefactor of something there being inevitably something which is ruled over
 and which receives the benefits. (29) Akin to these powers is the creative power which is called
 God: for by means of this power the Father, who begot and created all things, did also disperse
 and arrange them; so that the expression, "I am thy God," is equivalent to, "I am thy maker and
 creator;" (30) and it is the greatest of all possible gifts to have him for one's maker, who has also
 been the maker of the whole world. The soul, indeed, of the wicked man he did not make, for
 wickedness is hateful to God; and the soul, which is between good and bad, he made not by
 himself alone, according to the most sacred historian Moses, since that, like wax, was about to
 receive the different impressions of good and evil. (31) On which account it is said in the
 scriptures, "Let us make man in our own image," that if it receives a bad impression it may appear
 to be the work of others, but if it receives a good impression it may then appear to be the work of
 him who is the Creator only of what is beautiful and good. By all means, therefore, that must be a
 good man to whom he says, "I am thy God," as he has had him alone for his creator without the
 cooperation of any other being. (32) Moreover he brings up with this that doctrine which is
 established in many other passages, showing that God is the creator only of those men who are
 virtuous and wise; and the whole of this company has voluntarily deprived itself of the abundant
 possession of external things, and has neglected those things which are dear to his flesh. (33) For
 the athletes of vigorous health and high spirit have erected their servile bodies as a sort of
 fortification against the soul, but those men who have been devoted to the pursuit of instruction,
 and who are pale, and weak, and emaciated, having overloaded the vigour of the body with the
 power of the soul, and if one must tell the plain truth, being entirely dissolved into one species of
 soul, have through the energy of their minds become quite disentangled from the body. (34)
 Therefore that which is earthly is very naturally destroyed and overwhelmed when the entire mind
 resolves in every particular to make itself acceptable to God. But the race of these persons is rare
 and scarcely to be found, and one may almost say is unable to exist; and the following oracle,
 which is given with respect to Enoch, proves this: "Enoch pleased God, and he was not
 Found;"{20}{#ge 5:24.} (35) for by what kind of contemplation could a man attain to this good thing?
 What seas must he cross over? What islands, or what continents, must he visit? Must he dwell
 among Greeks or among the barbarians? (36) Are there not even to the present day some of
 those persons who have attained to perfection in philosophy, who say that there is no such thing
 as wisdom in the world, since there is also no such thing as a wise man? for that from the very
 beginning of the creation of mankind up to the present moment, there has never been any one who
 could be considered entirely blameless, for that it is impossible for a man who is bound up in a
 mortal body to be entirely and altogether happy. (37) Now whether these things are said correctly
 we will consider at the proper time: but at present let us stick to the subject before us, and follow
 the scripture, and say that there is such a thing as wisdom existing, and that he who loves wisdom
 is wise. But though the wise man has thus an actual existence he has escaped the notice of us
 who are wicked: for what is good will not unite with what is bad. (38) On this account it is that "the
 disposition which pleased God was not found;" as if in truth it has a real existence, but was
 concealed and had fled away to avoid any meeting in the same place with us, since it is said to
 have been translated; the meaning of which expression is that it emigrated and departed from its
 sojourn in this mortal life, to an abode in immortal life.
<p>
 V. (39) These men then, being mad with this divinely inspired madness, were made more
 ferocious; but there are others who are companions of a more manageable and humanised
 wisdom. By those men piety is practised to a most eminent degree, and the observance due to
 man is not neglected. And the sacred oracles are witnesses of this in which Abraham is addressed
 (the words being put in the mouth of God), "Thou shalt be pleasing in my Sight,"{21}{#ge 17:3.} that
 is to say, thou shalt be pleasing, not only to me but also to my works, in my eyes as judge, and
 overseer, and superintendant; (40) for if you honour your parents, or show mercy to the poor, or
 do good to your friends, or fight in defence of your country, or pay proper attention to the common
 principles of justice towards all men, you most certainly are pleasing to those with whom you
 associate, and you are also acceptable in the sight of God: for he sees all things with an eye which
 never slumbers, and he unites to himself with especial favour all that is good, and that he accepts
 and embraces. (41) Therefore the practicer of virtue, even while praying, proves the very same
 thing, saying, "The God to whom my fathers were Acceptable,"{22}{#ge 48:15.} and he adds the
 words "before him," for the sake of giving you to know the difference, the real practical difference
 between the expression, "to please God," by itself, and the same words with the addition of the
 sentence, "before him." For the one expression gives both meanings, and the other only one. (42)
 Thus also Moses, in his exhortatory admonitions, recommends his disciples such and such things,
 saying, "Thou shalt do what is pleasing before the Lord thy God,"{23}{#de 12:28.} as if he
 were to say, Do such things as we shall be worthy to appear before God, and what he when he
 sees them will accept. And these things are wont to appear equally pure both externally and
 Internally.{24}{this passage is given up by Mangey as corrupt and quite unintelligible. Mangey corrects it and gives a
 Latin translation which I have followed.} (43) And proceeding onwards from thence he wove the tent of the
 tabernacle with two boundaries of space, placing a veil between the two, in order to separate what
 is within from what is without. And also he gilded the sacred ark, the place wherein the laws were
 kept, both within and without; and he gave the great high priest two robes, the inner one made of
 linen, and the other one beautifully embroidered, with one robe reaching to the feet. (44) For these
 and such things as these are symbols of the soul which in its inner parts shows itself pure towards
 God, and in its exterior parts shows itself without reproach in reference to the world which is
 perceptible to the outward senses and to this life: with great felicity therefore was this said to the
 victorious wrestler, when he was about to have his brows crowned with the garlands of victory: and
 the declaration made with respect to him was of the following tenor, "You have been mightily
 powerful both with God and with Men;"{25}{#ge 32:28.} (45) for to have a good reputation with both
 classes, namely, with the uncreated God and with the creature, is the task of no small mind, but, if
 one must say the truth, it is one fit for that which is in the confines between the world and God. In
 short, it is necessary that the good man should be an attendant of God, for the creature is an
 object of care to the Ruler and Father of the universe; (46) for who is there who does not know,
 that even before the creation of the world God was himself sufficient to himself, and that he
 remained as much a friend as before after the creation of the world, without having undergone any
 change? Why then did he make what did not exist before? Because he was good and bounteous.
 Shall we not then, we who are slaves, follow our master, admiring, in an exceeding degree, the
 great first Cause of all things, and not altogether despising our own nature?
<p>
 VI. (47) But after he has said, "Be thou pleasing to me before me," he adds further, "and be thou
 blameless," using here a natural consequence and connection of the previous sentence. Do thou
 therefore all the more apply thyself to what is good that thou mayest be pleasing; and if thou canst
 not be pleasing, at all events abstain from open sins, that thou mayest not incur reproach. For he
 who does right is praiseworthy, and he who avoids doing wrong is not to be blamed. (48) And the
 most important prize is assigned to those who do right, namely, the prize of feeling that they are
 acceptable to God: but the second prize belongs to those who do no sin, that, namely, of avoiding
 blame; and, perhaps, in the case of the mortal race of mankind, the doing no sin is set down as
 equivalent to doing right; for who, as Job says is "pure from pollution, even if his life be but one
 single day Long?"{26}{#job 14:4.} (49) In fact, the things which pollute the soul are infinite in number,
 and it is impossible completely to wash them away and to efface their stains; for there are, of
 necessity, left disasters which are akin to every mortal man, which it is natural indeed to weaken,
 but impossible wholly to eradicate. (50) Does any one therefore seek a just, or prudent, or
 temperate, or, in short, any perfectly good man, in this confused life? Be content if you find one
 who is not wholly unjust, or foolish, or intemperate, or cowardly, or who is not utterly worthless; for
 the avoidance of evil is a thing with which to be content, but the complete acquisition of the virtues
 is unattainable to any man, such as is endowed with our nature. (51) It was therefore with great
 reason that it was said, "and be thou blameless," the speaker thinking that it is a great addition
 towards a happy life to live without sin and without reproach; but the man who has deliberately
 chosen this way of life, promises to leave his inheritance in accordance with the covenant, such as
 is becoming to God to give, and to a wise man to accept, (52) for he says, "I will place my covenant
 between me and between Thee;"{27}{#ge 17:2.} and covenants and testaments are written for the
 advantage of those who are worthy of the gift, so that a testament is a symbol of grace, which God
 has placed between himself who proffers it and man who receives it; (53) and this is the very
 extravagance of beneficence, that there is nothing between God and the soul except his own virgin
 grace. And I have written two commentaries on the whole discussion concerning testaments, and
 for that reason I now deliberately pass over that subject, for the sake of not appearing to repeat
 what I have said before; and also at the same time, because I do not wish here to interrupt the
 connected course of this discussion.
<p>
 VII. (54) And immediately afterwards it is said, "And Abraham fell on his face:" was he not about, in
 accordance with the divine promises, to recognize himself and the nothingness of the race of
 mankind, and so to fall down before him who stood firm, by way of displaying the conception which
 he entertained of himself and of God? Forsooth that God, standing always in the same place,
 moves the whole composition of the world, not by means of his legs, for he has not the form of a
 man, but by showing his unalterable and immovable essence. (55) But man, being never settled
 firmly in the same place, admits of different changes at different times, and being tripped up,
 miserable man that he is (for, in fact, his whole life is one continued stumble), he meets with a
 terrible fall; (56) but he who does this against his will is ignorant, and he who does it voluntarily is
 docile; on which account he is said to fall on his face, that is to say, in his outward senses, in his
 speech, in his mind, all but crying out loudly and shouting that the outward sense has fallen,
 inasmuch as it was unable, by itself, to feel as it should, if it had not been aroused by the
 providence of the Saviour, to take hold of the bodies which lay in its way. And speech too has
 fallen, being unable to give a proper explanation of anything in existence, unless he who originally
 made and adapted the organ of the voice, having opened its mouth and enabled its tongue to
 articulate, should strike it so as to produce harmonious sounds. Moreover, the king of all the mind
 has fallen, being deprived of its comprehension, unless the Creator of all living things were again to
 raise it up and re-establish it, and furnishing it with the most acutely seeing eyes, to lead it to a
 sight of incorporeal things.
<p>
 VIII. (57) Therefore admiring this same disposition when thus taking to flight, and submitting to a
 voluntary fall by reason of the confession which it had made respecting the living God, namely, that
 he stands in truth and is one only, while all other things beneath him are subject to all kinds of
 motions and alterations, he speaks to it, and allows it to enter into conversation with him, saying,
 "And I, behold my covenant is with Thee."{28}{#ge 17:4.} (58) And this expression conceals
 beneath its figurative words such a meaning as this: There are very many kinds of covenants,
 which distribute graces and gifts to those who are worthy to receive them; but the highest kind of
 covenant of all is I myself: for God, having displayed himself as far as it was possible for that being
 to be displayed who cannot be shown by the words which he has used, adds further, "And I too,
 behold my covenant;" the beginning and fountain of all graces is I myself. (59) For on some
 persons God is in the habit of bestowing his graces by the intervention of others; as, for instance,
 through the medium of earth, water, air, the sun, the moon, heaven, and other incorporeal powers.
 But he bestows them on others through himself alone, exhibiting himself as the inheritance of those
 who receive him, whom from that he thinks worthy of another appellation: (60) for it is said in the
 scripture, "Thy name shall not be called Abram, but Abraham shall thy name be." Some, then, of
 those persons who are fond of disputes, and who are always eager to affix a stain upon what is
 irreproachable, on things as well as bodies, and who wage an implacable war against sacred
 things, while they calumniate everything which does not appear to preserve strict decorum in
 speech, being the symbols of nature which is always fond of being concealed, perverting it all so as
 to give it a worse appearance after a very accurate investigation, do especially find fault with the
 changes of names. (61) And it is only lately that I heard an ungodly and impious man mocking and
 ridiculing these things, who ventured to say, "Surely they are great and exceeding gifts which
 Moses says that the Ruler of the universe offers, who, by the addition of one element, the one
 letter alpha, a superfluous element; {29}{the text here is very corrupt. Mangey adopts the emendations of
 Markland, and I have followed his translation.} and then again adding another element, the letter rho,
 appears to have bestowed upon men a most marvellous and great benefit; for he has called the
 wife of Abram Sarrah instead of Sarah, doubling the Rho," and connecting a number of similar
 arguments without drawing breath, and joking and mocking, he went through many instances. (62)
 But at no distant period he suffered a suitable punishment for his insane, wickedness; for on a very
 slight and ordinary provocation he hanged himself, in order that so polluted and impure a person
 might not die by a pure and unpolluted death.
<p>
 IX. But we may justly, in order to prevent any one else from falling into the same error, eradicate
 the erroneous notions which have been formed on the subject, arguing the matter on the principle
 of natural philosophy, and proving that these things which are here said are worthy of all attention.
 (63) God does not bestow on men mutes and vowels, or, in short, nouns and verbs; since when he
 created plants and animals, he summoned them before man as their governor, that he might give
 each of them their appropriate names by a reference to the knowledge which he had of all things;
 for, says the scripture, "Whatever Adam called any thing, that was the name Thereof."{30}{genesis
 2:19.} (64) Therefore since God did not think fit to take upon himself even the active imposition of
 the names, but entrusted the task to a wise man, the author of the whole race of mankind, it is
 reasonable to suppose that he himself gave and arranged the different parts, and syllables, and
 letters of nouns, disposing not only the vowels, but even the mutes, and that he did this too to make
 a show of liberality and exceeding beneficence? It is impossible to say so. (65) But such things as
 these are the characteristic marks of different powers; small marks of great powers, marks
 perceptible by the outward senses of powers which are indistinct; and the powers themselves are
 discerned in most excellent doctrines, in true and pure conceptions, in the improvement of souls.
 And it is easy to see a proof of this if we make a beginning with the man who is here spoken of as
 having his name changed; (66) for the name Abram, being interpreted, means "sublime father," but
 Abraham means the "elect father of sound;" and how these names differ from one another we shall
 know more clearly if we first of all read what is exhibited under each of them. (67) Now using
 allegorical language, we call that man sublime who raises himself from the earth to a height, and
 who devotes himself to the inspection of high things; and we also call him a haunter of high regions,
 and a meteorologist, inquiring what is the magnitude of the sun, what are his motions, how he
 influences the seasons of the year, advancing as he does and retreating back again, with
 revolutions of equal speed, and investigating as he does the subjects of the radiance of the moon,
 of its shape, of its waning, of its increase, and of the motion of the other stars, whether fixed or
 wandering; (68) for the inquiry into these matters belongs not to an ill-conditioned or barren soul,
 but to one which is eminently endowed by nature, and which is able to produce an entire and
 perfect offspring; on which account the scripture calls the meteorologist, "father," inasmuch as he
 is not unproductive of wisdom.
<p>
 X. (69) Now the symbols represented by the name of Abram are thus accurately defined; those
 conveyed under the name of Abraham are such as we shall proceed to demonstrate. The
 meanings now are three, "the father," and "elect," and "of sound." Now by the word "sound" here,
 we mean uttered speech; for the sounding organ of the living animal is the organ of speech. Of this
 faculty we say that the father is the mind, for it is from the mind, as from a fountain, that the stream
 of speech proceeds. The word "elect" belongs to the mind of the wise man, for whatever is most
 excellent is found in him; (70) therefore the man devoted to learning and occupied in the
 contemplation of sublime subjects, was sketched out according to the former characteristic marks,
 but the philosopher, or I should rather say the wise man, was exhibited in accordance with those of
 which we have just given an outline. Think not, then, any longer that the Deity bestows a change of
 names, but consider that what he gives is a correction of the moral character by means of
 symbols; (71) for having invited the nature of heaven, and whom some call a mathematician, to a
 participation in virtue, he made him wise and called him so. For having given an appropriate name
 to his transformed disposition, he named him, as the Hebrews would call it, "Abraham," but in the
 language of the Greeks, "the elect father of sound;" (72) for says he, On what account dost thou
 investigate the motions and periods of the stars? and why hast thou bounded up so high from the
 earth to the heavens? Is it merely that you may indulge your curiosity with respect to those
 matters? And what advantage could accrue to you from all this curiosity? What destruction of
 pleasure would is cause? What defeat of appetite? What dissolution of pain or fear? What
 eradication of the passions which disturb and agitate the soul? (73) For as there is no advantage
 in trees unless they are productive of fruit, so in the same way there is no use in the study of
 natural philosophy unless it is likely to confer upon a man the acquisition of virtue, for that is its
 proper fruit. (74) On which account some of the ancients have compared the discussion and
 consideration of philosophy to a field, and have likened the physical portion of it to the plants, the
 logical part to the hedges and fences, the moral part to the fruit, (75) thinking that the walls which
 are built around for the sake of protecting the fruit have been erected by the possessors of the
 land, and that the plants have been created for the sake of the production of fruit; thus, therefore,
 they said that in philosophy it is requisite for the consideration of the physical and the logical part of
 philosophy to be referred to the moral part, by which the moral character is improved, which as a
 desire at the same time for both the acquisition and the use of virtue. (76) This is the lesson which
 we have been taught concerning the man who in word indeed had his name changed, but who in
 reality changed his nature from the consideration of natural to that of moral philosophy, and who
 abandoned the contemplation of the world itself for the knowledge of the Being who created the
 world; by which knowledge he acquired piety, the most excellent of all possessions.
<p>
 XI. (77) We will now speak of his wife, Sarah, for she too had her name changed to Sarrah by the
 addition of the one element, the letter rho. These, then, are the names, and we must now explain
 what they mean. Sarah, being interpreted, signifies "my authority," but Sarrah signifies "princess;"
 the former name, (78) therefore, is a symbol of specific virtue, but the latter of generic virtue. But
 in proportion as genus is superior to species in regard of quantity, in the same proportion does the
 latter name excel the former; for species is something small and perishable, but genus is
 numerous and immortal, (79) and the intention of God is to bestow great and immortal things
 instead of such as are small and perishable, and this is a task suited to his dignity. Now the
 prudence which exists in the virtuous man is the authority of himself alone, and he who has it would
 not err if he were to say, my authority is the prudence which is in me; but that which has stretched
 out this authority is generic prudence, not any longer the authority of this or that person, but
 absolute intrinsic authority; therefore that which exists only in species will perish at the same time
 with its possessor, but that which, like a seal, has stamped it with an impression, is free from all
 mortality, and will remain for ever and ever imperishable. (80) Thus also those arts which exist only
 in species perish along with those who have acquired them, such as geometricians, grammarians,
 and musicians, but the generic arts remain exempt from destruction. And, again, he gives an
 additional sketch of his meaning when he teaches by the same name that every virtue is a
 princess, and a queen, and a ruler of all the affairs of life.
<p>
 XII. (81) But it has also happened that Jacob had his name changed to Israel; and this, too, was a
 felicitous alteration. Why so? Because the name Jacob means "a supplanter," but the name Israel
 signifies "the man who sees God." Now it is the employment of a supplanter, who practices virtue,
 to move, and disturb, and upset the foundations of passion on which it is established, and whatever
 there is of any strength which is founded on them. But these things are not brought about without a
 struggle or without severe labour; but only when any one, having gone through all the labours of
 prudence, then proceeds to practise himself in the exercises of the soul and to wrestle against the
 reasonings which are hostile to it, and which seek to torment it; but it is the part of him who sees
 God not to depart from the sacred contest without the crown of victory, but rather to carry off the
 prize of triumph. (82) And what more flourishing and more suitable crown could be woven for the
 victorious soul than one by which it will be able acutely and clearly to behold the living God? At least
 a beautiful prize is thus proposed for the soul which delights in the practice of virtue, namely, the
 being endowed with sight adequate to the clear comprehension of the only thing which is really
 worth beholding.
<p>
 XIII. (83) And it is worth while here to raise the question why Abraham, from the time that his name
 was changed, is always thought worthy of this same appellation, and is no longer called by his
 former name; but Jacob, who is also called Israel, is nevertheless called Jacob too, as he was
 before the change of his name; and, indeed, is called Jacob oftener than Israel. We must say,
 then, that these facts are characters by which it is seen that the virtue which is taught differs from
 that which is acquired by practice; (84) for the man who is improved by instruction, having received
 a happy and virtuous nature, uses that virtue alone which, by means of memory co-operating with
 it, implants in him an absence of forgetfulness, so that he comprehends and takes firm hold of all
 the things which he has once learnt; but he who practices virtue, since he is continually exercising
 himself, stops to take breath, and relaxes his efforts for a while, collecting himself and recovering
 the vigour which was a little impaired by his exertions, just as those men do who have oiled their
 bodies for the contests in the arena. For these men, also, labouring at their training exercises, in
 order to prevent their powers being utterly broken down, anoint themselves with oil on account of
 the violent and continued nature of their exercise. (85) Then the man who is improved by
 instruction, having an immortal monitor, receives from him a harmonious and imperishable
 advantage, without suffering any change; but the practiser of virtue is impelled to action by his own
 inclination alone, and he exercises himself in it, and labours at it in order to change that passion,
 which is akin to a created being; and even if he attains to perfection, he still, being fatigued, returns
 to his ancient kind of labour; (86) for he is more inclined to endure toil, but the other is more
 fortunate, for he has another person as a teacher. But this man, by his own unassisted efforts,
 investigates, and inquires, and pushes his examination, investigating the mysteries of nature with
 great earnestness, and exerting continual and incessant labour. (87) For this reason God, who
 never changes, altered the name of Abraham, since he was about to remain in a similar condition,
 in order that that which was to be firmly established might be confirmed by him who was standing
 firmly, and who was remaining in the same state in the same manner. But it was an angel who
 altered the name of Jacob, being the Word, the minister of God; in order that it might be confessed
 and ascertained, that there is none of the things whose existence is subsequent to that of the living
 God, which is the cause of unchangeable and unvarying firmness. ... but of that harmony which, as
 in a musical instrument, contains the intensity and relaxation of sounds so as to produce an
 artistical combination of melody.
<p>
 XIV. (88) But, there being three leaders and authors of this race, the two at each extremity of it had
 their names changed, namely Abraham and Jacob: but the one in the middle, Isaac, always
 retained the same appellation. Why was this? Because both that virtue which is derived from
 teaching and that which is attained to by practice, admit of improvement and advancement: for the
 man who receives instruction desires a knowledge of those matters of which he is ignorant and he
 who applies himself to practice desires the crowns of victory, and the prizes which are proposed to
 his industrious and contemplation-loving soul. But the race which is self-taught and which derives
 all its learning from its own diligence inasmuch as it exists rather by nature than by study, was at
 the very beginning introduced as equal, and perfect, and even, there being no number whatever
 deficient of those which tend to completeness. (89) Nor indeed does Joseph have any such need,
 he who is the president of the necessities of the body; for he also changes his name, being called
 Psonthomphanech by the king of the country. And what the meaning of these names is we must
 explain; the name Joseph, being interpreted, signifies "an addition." For things which are put by the
 side are an addition to those which exist by nature; for instance, gold, silver, possessions,
 revenues, the ministrations of servants, abundant treasure of heirlooms, and furniture, and other
 superfluities, and the infinite multitude of the different efficients of pleasure which some persons
 possess; (90) the provider and superintendant of which was called Joseph, or addition, by a very
 felicitous nomenclature: since he had undertaken the superintendence of the things which were to
 be brought in from without, and added to the natural things previously existing in the course of
 nature. And the sacred scriptures testify that this is the case, showing that he was the purveyor of
 the food of all the corporeal region, Egypt, having stored it up in his treasure-houses.
<p>
 XV. (91) Such a person as this, then, Joseph is recognized as being by his distinctive marks and
 name. Let us now see what sort of person is indicated by the name Psonthomphanech. Now this
 name being interpreted means, "a mouth judging in an answer;" for every foolish person thinks that
 the man who is very rich and overflowing with external possessions, must at once be wise and
 sensible, competent to give an answer to any question which any one puts to him, and competent
 also of his own head to deliver advantageous and sagacious opinions. And, in short, by such men
 prudence is supposed to be identical with good fortune, while one ought, on the contrary, to
 consider good fortune as consisting in being prudent; for it is fitting that what is unstable should be
 under the direction of that which stands firmly. (92) And indeed his father gave to his own uterine
 brother the name of Benjamin:{31}{#ge 35:18.} but his mother called him the son of her sorrow,
 speaking most completely in accordance with nature. For the name Benjamin being interpreted
 means, "the son of days:" and the day is illuminated by the light of the sun which is perceptible by
 the outward senses: and to this we liken vain glory. (93) For that has a certain brilliancy
 appreciable by the outward senses in the praises which it receives from the multitude and from the
 common herd of men, in formally enrolled decrees, in the erection of statues and images, in purple
 robes and golden crowns, in chariots and teams of four horses, and processions of the multitude.
 He therefore who is an admirer and desirer of such things is very appropriately called a son of
 days: that is to say, of that light which is perceptible by the outward senses and of the brilliancy
 which attends vain glory. (94) This felicitous and appropriate name the elder word and real father
 imposes on him; but the soul which has suffered gives him a name suited to what she has suffered.
 For she calls him the son of her sorrow. Why so? Because those men who are borne about by
 vain glory are supposed indeed to be happy, but in real truth are unhappy. (95) For the things which
 oppose their happiness are numerous, envy, discontent, emulation, continual strife, irreconcileable
 enmities lasting till death, hostilities handed down in succession to one's children's children--a
 destiny not at all to be desired. (96) Very necessarily therefore did the divinely inspired prophet
 represent that vain glory as dying in the very act of bringing forth; for says he, "Rachel died, having
 had a bad Delivery."{32}{#ge 35:16.} Since, in truth and reality, the sowing and generation of vain
 glory perceptible by the outward senses is the death of the soul.
<p>
 XVI. (97) And what shall we say of the sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh? Are they not, in
 strict accordance with nature, compared to the two eldest sons of Jacob, Reuben and Simeon?
 For the scripture says, "Thy two sons who were born in Egypt, before that I came into Egypt,
 belong to me; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be to me as Reuben and as Simeon."{33}{#ge 48:5.}
 Let us now then see in what manner the one pair are likened to the other pair. (98) Reuben is the
 symbol of a good natural disposition, for the name being interpreted means, "A seeing son;" since
 every one who is endowed with tolerable acuteness of mind and a good disposition is capable of
 seeing; and Ephraim, as we have already frequently said in other places, is a symbol of memory,
 for his name being interpreted signifies, "productiveness of fruit," and the most excellent fruit of the
 soul is memory; and there is no one thing so nearly akin to another as remembering is to a man of
 good natural endowments. (99) Again, the name of Simeon is a symbol of learning and instruction;
 for, being interpreted, it signifies "listening," and it is the especial part of a learner to listen and
 attend to what is said. But Manasseh is a symbol of "recollection," for thus that art is called, from
 forgetfulness; (100) for it must of necessity happen to the man who has advanced out of
 forgetfulness to recollect, and recollecting especially belongs to learning, for very often his notions
 escape from the man who is learning, as out of weakness he is unable to retain them, and then
 again they return to him as at the beginning. The condition therefore which arises from this
 escaping of his notions is denominated forgetfulness, and that which arises from their returning to
 him is called recollection. (101) Now is not memory very naturally spoken of as connected with
 good natural endowments, and recollection as akin to learning? And, indeed, the same relation
 which Simeon bears to Reuben, that is to say, learning to natural endowment, the same does
 Manasseh bear to Ephraim, and the same does recollection bear to memory. (102) For as the
 man of good natural endowments is better than he who is only a learner, for the one resembles the
 sense of seeing, the other that of hearing, and hearing is always reckoned as entitled to a lesser
 honour than seeing; so also, he who is endowed with a good memory is at all times superior to him
 who only recollects, because the one is combined with forgetfulness, but the other continues
 unalloyed and unadulterated from beginning to end.
<p>
 XVII. (103) And indeed the scriptures at one time call the father-in-law of the first prophets Jother,
 and at another time Raguel-Jother, when pride is flourishing and at its height; for the name Jother
 being interpreted means "superfluous," and pride is superfluous in an honest and sincere life,
 turning into ridicule, as it does, all that is equal and necessary to life, and honouring the unequal
 things of excess and covetousness. (104) This passion honours human things above divine, and
 customs above laws, and profane above sacred things, and mortal above immortal things, and, in
 short, appearances above reality; and it even ventures of its accord to pass on into the rank of
 counsellors, suggesting to the wise man not to teach those things which alone are worthy to be
 known, namely, "the commandments of God, and the Law,"{34}{#ex 18:11.} but to study the
 covenants and contracts of men with one another, which are almost the causes of the society
 which exists among them being so little sociable. But the great man is obedient in all things, thinking
 that little things are adapted to little people, and that great things are justly added to the great; (105)
 but very often this man who is wise in his own conceit, and who, passing over from the herds which
 the blind had assigned to him for him to guide, having sought out the divine herd, becomes no small
 portion of it; admiring the leader of nature, and marvelling at his way of leading which he employs in
 his care of his own flocks, for the name Raguel being interpreted, signifies the "pastoral care of
 God."{35}{#ex 2:18.}
<p>
 XVIII. (106) The main part has now been explained; we will now proceed to adduce the proofs. In
 the first place the scripture represents him as the cultivator of judgment and of justice, for the
 name Midian, being interpreted, means "out of judgment." And this is said in a twofold sense, for
 some times it signifies both selection and rejection, such as usually happens to those who are
 competitors in those contests which are called sacred; for numbers as they appear not qualified,
 are rejected by the masters of the games. (107) These are the men who have been initiated in the
 unholy rites of Beelphegor, {36}{#nu 25:3.} and having widened all the mouths of the body to
 enable them to receive the streams which are poured into them from without, for the name
 Beelphegor is interpreted "the mouth above the skin," for they have overwhelmed the mind, the
 governor of the body, and have sunk it down to the lowest depth, so that it can never emerge, nor
 even hold up its head in ever so slight a degree. (108) And it suffered this until Phineas, the lover
 of peace and manifest priest of God, came as a champion of his own accord, being by nature a
 hater of all that is evil, and filled with an admiration and desire for what is good; and as he took a
 coadjutor, that is to say, the well sharpened and sharp-edged sword, competent to investigate and
 examine everything, he could not be deceived, but exerting a vigorous strength, he pierced passion
 through her womb, that it might not hereafter bring forth any divinely caused evil. (109) Now
 between these men and the seeing race there is a terrible war, in which no one of the combatants
 differed in language, {37}{#ex 31:29} but each returned home unwounded and safe, crowned with
 the garlands of victory.
<p>
 XIX. (110) This now is one of the things which are shown by the name of Midian; another is that
 more excellent and judicial species which by the affinity of marriage is connected with the prophetic
 race. The scripture then says, "The priest of judgment and justice" (that is to say, of Midian) "has
 seven Daughters;"{38}{#ex 2:16.} (111) by which seven daughters are frequently intimated the
 powers of the irrational part of the soul, the power of generation and the voice, and the five
 outward senses, tending the flocks of their father; for by means of these seven powers it is that all
 the progresses and increases of their father, the mind, exist in the perceptions which are produced
 from him. These, then, coming each to its appropriate object, the power of sight to colours and
 shapes, the sense of hearing to sounds, the faculty of smelling to scents, taste to flavours, and all
 the other faculties to those objects which are adapted for their exercise do in a manner imbibe
 some of the external objects of the outward senses, until they have filled all the channels of the
 soul, and from these channels they give drink to the sheep of their father; I mean by these sheep
 that most pure flock of the reason which bears safety and ornament at the same time. (112) But
 the companions of envy and jealousy, the leaders of the wicked herd coming up, drive them away
 from that use of their powers which is in accordance with nature, for some conduct these things
 which are without, inwards to the mind as to a judge and a king, in order that they may do well from
 having the most excellent of governors; (113) but others take the opposite side, pursuing and
 proclaiming the exact contrary, while it is possible for the mind to be drawn towards them, and to
 give up the flock which was entrusted to it to Feed.{39}{this passage is very corrupt in the original. I have
 followed Mangey in adopting the corrections of Marsland.} Until the good disposition, devoted to virtue and
 inspired by God, which for awhile has appeared to be resting in inactivity, by name Moses, holds
 his shield over them and defends them from those who would attack them, nourishing the flock of
 his father on wholesome words, (114) and they having escaped the attack of the enemies of
 intellect who admire only the external appendages, like people in tragedies, go no longer to Jother
 but to Raguel, for they have abandoned all connections with pride, and having connected
 themselves with lawful persuasion, choosing to become a portion of the sacred flock, of which the
 divine word is the leader, as his name shows, for it signifies the pastoral care of God.
<p>
 XX. (115) But while he is taking care of his own flock, all kinds of good things are given all at once
 to those of the sheep who are obedient, and who do not resist his will; and in the Psalms we find a
 song in these words, "The Lord is my shepherd, therefore shall I lack Nothing;"{40}{psalm 23:1.} (116)
 therefore the mind which has had the royal shepherd, the divine word, for its instructor, will very
 naturally ask of his seven daughters, "Why is it that you have contended with such great haste to
 come hither this Day?"{41}{#ex 2:18.} for formerly, when you met with the objects of the outward
 sense, remaining a long time outside, you were a long time in returning again by reason of the
 manner in which you were allured by them, but now I do not know what it is that has happened to
 you, but you are speedy in your return, contrary to your usual custom. (117) Therefore they will say
 that there were not the same causes why they should run back with such exceeding speed, making
 the double course from the objects of the outward sense and to the objects of the outward sense,
 without stopping to take breath, and with excessive impetuosity; but that the cause was rather the
 man who delivered them from the shepherds of the wild flock. And they call Moses an Egyptian, a
 man who was not only a Hebrew, but even a Hebrew of the very purest race, of the only tribe which
 is consecrated, because they are unable to rise above their own nature; (118) for the outward
 senses, being on the confines between the objects of the intellect and those of the outward
 senses, we must be content if they aim at both of them, and are not allured by the objects of the
 outward sense alone. And to think that they are inclined only to attend to the things which are purely
 objects of the intellect is great folly; on which account they give him both these names, since when
 they call him a man, they indicate the things which are within the province of reason alone to
 contemplate, and when they call him an Egyptian, they indicate the objects of the external senses.
 (119) When they had heard this, he will again inquire, "Where is the man?" In what part of you is
 the reasonable species dwelling? Why have you left it so easily, and have not rather after having
 once met with it, preserved that which was the most beautiful of possessions, and the most
 advantageous for yourselves? (120) But even if you have not done so before, at least call it to you
 now, that it may eat of and be supported by your improvement and your close connection with him;
 for perhaps he will even dwell with you, and will bring with him the winged, and divinely inspired, and
 prophetical race by name Zipporah.
<p>
 XXI. (121) Thus much we have thought fit to say on this subject. But, moreover, Moses also
 changes the name of Hosea into that of Joshua; displaying by his new name the distinctive
 qualities of his character; (122) for the name Hosea is interpreted, "what sort of a person is this?"
 but Joshua means "the salvation of the Lord," being the name of the most excellent possible
 character; for the habits are better with respect to those persons who are of such and such
 qualities from being influenced by them: as, for instance, music is better in a musician, physic in a
 physician, and each art of a distinctive quality in each artist, regarded both in its perpetuity, and in
 its power, and in its unerring perfection with regard to the objects of its speculation. For a habit is
 something everlasting, energising, and perfect; but a man of such and such a quality is mortal, the
 object of action, and imperfect. And what is imperishable is superior to what is mortal, the efficient
 cause is better than that which is the object of action; and what is perfect is preferable to what is
 imperfect. (123) In this way the coinage of the above mentioned description was changed and
 received the stamp of a better kind of appearance. And Caleb himself was changed wholly and
 entirely; "For," as the scripture says, "a new spirit was in Him;"{42}{#nu 14:24.} as if the dominant
 part in him had been changed into complete perfection; for the name Caleb, being interpreted,
 means "the whole heart." (124) And a proof of this is to be gathered from the fact that the mind is
 changed, not by being biassed and inclining in one particular direction or the other, but wholly and
 entirely in the direction which is good; and that, even if there is any thing which is not very
 praiseworthy indeed, it makes that to depart by arguments conducive to repentance; for, having in
 this manner washed off all the defilements which polluted it, and having availed itself of the baths
 and purifications of wisdom, it must inevitably look brilliant.
<p>
 XXII. (125) But it happens to the arch-prophet to have many names: for when he interprets and
 explains the oracles which are delivered by God, he is called Moses; and when he prays for and
 blesses the people, he is called the man of God; {43}{#de 33:1.} and when Egypt is paying the
 penalty of its impious actions, he is then denominated the god of him who is the king of the country,
 namely, of Pharaoh.{44}{#ex 7:1.} And why is all this? (126) Because to alter a code of laws for
 the advantage of those who are to use them is the part of a man who is always handling divine
 things, and having them in his hands; and who is called a lawgiver by the allknowing God, and who
 has received from him a great gift--the interpretation of the sacred laws, and the spirit of prophecy
 in accordance with them. For the name Moses, being translated, signifies "gain," and it also means
 handling, for the reasons which I have already enumerated. (127) But to pray and to bless are not
 the duties of any ordinary man, but they belong to one who has not admitted any connection with
 created things, but who has devoted himself to God, the governor and the father of all men. (128)
 And any one must be content to whom it has been allowed to use the privilege of blessing. And to
 be able also to procure good for others belongs to a greater and more perfect soul, and is the
<p>
 profession of one who is really inspired by God, which he who has attained to may reasonably be
 called God. But also, this same person is God, inasmuch as he is wise, and as on this account he
 rules over every foolish person, even if such foolish person be established and strengthened by a
 haughty sceptre, and be ever so proud on this account; (129) for the Ruler of the universe, even
 though some persons are about to be punished for intolerable acts of wickedness, nevertheless is
 willing to admit some intercessors to mediate on their behalf, who, in imitation of the merciful power
 of the father, exercise their power of punishment with more moderation and humanity; but to do
 good is the peculiar attribute of God.
<p>
 XXIII. (130) Having now discussed at sufficient length the subject of change and alteration of
 names, we will turn to the matters which come next in order in our proposed examination.
 Immediately after the events which we have just mentioned, came the birth of Isaac; for after God
 had given to his mother the name of Sarrah instead of Sarah, he said to Abraham, "I will give unto
 thee a Son."{45}{#ge 17:16.} We must consider each of the things here indicated particularly.
 (131) Now he who is properly said to give any thing whatever must by all means be giving what is
 his own private property. And if this is true beyond controversy, then it would follow that Isaac must
 not have been a man, but a being synonymous with that most exquisite joy of all pleasures, namely,
 laughter, the adopted son of God, who gave him as a soother and cheerer to the most
 peace-loving souls; (132) for it is absurd to suppose that there was one who was a man, and
 another of whom bastard and illegitimate offspring were descended: and, indeed, Moses calls the
 man of an intellect devoted to virtue a god, when he says, "The Lord, seeing that Leah was hated,
 opened her Womb."{46}{#ge 29:31.} (133) For having felt compassion and pity for virtue as being
 hated by the race of mankind, and for the soul which loves virtue, he makes the nature which loves
 beauty barren, but opens the fountain of fecundity and gives it a prosperous labour. (134) But
 Tamar, when she became pregnant of divine seeds, and did not know who it was who had sown
 them (for it is said that at that time "she had covered her face," as Moses did when he turned
 away, having a reverential fear of beholding God), still when she saw the tokens and the evidences
 and decided within herself that it was not a mortal man who gave these things, cried out, "To
 whomsoever these things belong, it is by him that I am with Child."{47}{#ge 38:25.} (135) Whose
 was the ring, or the pledge, or the seal of the whole, or the archetypal appearance, according to
 which all the things, though devoid of species and of distinctive quality, were all stamped and
 marked? And whose again was the armlet, or the ornament; that is to say, destiny, the link and
 analogy of all things which have an indissoluble connection? Whose, again, was the staff, the thing
 of strong support, which wavers not, which is not moved; that is to say, admonition, correction,
 instruction? Whose is the sceptre, the kingly power? (136) does it not belong to God alone?
 Therefore, the disposition inclined to confession, that is to say, Judah, being pleased at her
 possessed and inspired condition, speaks freely, saying, "She has spoken justly, because I gave
 her in marriage to no mortal Man;"{48}{#ge 17:26.} thinking it an impious thing to pollute divine with
 profane things.
<p>
 XXIV. (137) And wisdom, which, after the fashion of a mother, has conceived and brought fourth
 the self-taught race, points out that it is God who is the sower of it; for, after the offspring is
 brought forth, she speak magnificently, saying, "The Lord has caused me Laughter;"{49}{#ge 21:6.}
 an expression equivalent to, he has fashioned, he has made, he has begotten Isaac, since Isaac
 is the same with laughter. (138) But it does not belong to every one to hear this sound, since the
 evil of superstition is very widely spread among us, and has overwhelmed many unmanly and
 ignoble souls; on which account she adds, "For whoever hears this will not rejoice with me." As if
 those persons were very few whose ears are opened and pricked up so as to be inclined to the
 reception of these sacred words, which teach that it is the peculiar employment of the only God to
 sow and to beget what is good; to which words all other persons are deaf. (139) And I know that
 this illustrious oracle was formerly delivered from the mouth of the prophet. "Thy fruit has been
 found from me: who is wise and will understand these things? who is prudent and will know
 Them?"{50}{#ho 14:9.} But I have observed, and comprehended, and admired him who causes to
 resound, and who himself, invisible as he is, does in an invisible manner strike the organ of the
 voice; being amazed also at the same time at what was uttered. (140) For if there be any good
 thing among existing things, that, or I should rather say the whole heaven and the whole world, if
 one must tell the truth, is the fruit of God; being preserved upon his eternal and everflourishing
 nature as upon a tree. But it belongs to wise and understanding men to understand and to confess
 such things as these, and not to the ignorant.
<p>
 XXV. (141) We have now then explained what is meant by the words, "I will give unto thee." We
 must now explain the words, "out of her." Some now have understood them as meaning that which
 exists out of her, thinking that it has been most correctly decided by right reason that the soul
 never displays any peculiar beauty of its own, but only such as comes to it from without, in
 accordance with the greatness of the good will of God who showers his graces upon it. (142) But
 others understand these words to mean instant rapidity; for that the words (ex autes, which we
 have translated) "out of her," are here equivalent to, "at once, immediately, without any delay,
 without hesitation." And it is in this way that the gifts of God usually come to men, outstripping the
 differences of time. There is a third class of persons who say, that virtue is the mother of all
 created good, without having received the seed of it from any mortal man; (143) and to those who
 ask, whether she who is barren has an offspring (for the holy scriptures, which some time ago
 represented Sarrah as barren, now confess that she will become a mother); this answer must be
 given, that a woman who is barren cannot, in the course of nature, bring forth an offspring, just as
 a blind man cannot see, nor a deaf man hear; but that the soul, which is barren of bad things, and
 which is unproductive of immoderate license of the passions and vices, is alone very nearly
 attaining to a happy delivery, bringing forth objects worthy of love, namely, the number seven,
 according to the hymn which is sung by Grace, that is, by Hannah, who says, "she who was barren
 hath born seven, and she who had many children has become weak:"{51}{#1Sa 2:5.} (144) and
 what she means by, "She who has many children," is the mind, which being pregnant of mixed and
 promiscuous reasonings, from all quarters confused together, by reason of the multitudes which
 crowd around her, and of the disorder which they cause, brings forth incurable evils; and by "she
 who was barren," she means that the mind which had never received any mortal seed, as if it were
 productive of offspring, but has avoided and shunned all association and all connection with the
 wicked, and clings to the seventh, and to the most peaceful numbers in accordance with it, for it
 deserves to be pregnant of it, and to be called its mother.
<p>
 XXVI. (145) This then is the meaning of the words, "out of her." We must now consider the third
 point, namely, what that is which is called her son. In the first place, then, there is this worthy of our
 admiration, that God does not say that he will give her many children, but that he will give her one
 only. And why is this? Because it is the nature of what is good to be investigated, not so much with
 respect to its number or magnitude, as with respect to its power; (146) for musical precepts, to
 take them for an instance, or rules of grammar, or of geometry, or of justice, or of wisdom, or of
 manly courage, or of temperance, are very numerous indeed; but the science itself of music, or
 grammar, or geometry, and still more the virtue of justice, or temperance, or wisdom, or manly
 courage, is only one thing, the loftiest perfection, in no respect differing from the archetypal model,
 after which all those numerous and countless precepts were formed. (147) And this is why he only
 says that he will give her one son. And now he called it a son, not speaking carelessly or
 inconsiderately, but for the sake of showing that it is not a foreign, or a supposititious, nor an
 adopted, nor an illegitimate child, but a legitimate child, a proper citizen, inasmuch as a foreign child
 cannot be the offspring of a truly citizen soul, for the Greek word teknon (son), is derived from
 tokos (bringing forth), by way of showing the kindred by which children are, by nature, united to their
 parents.
<p>
 XXVII. (148) And, says God, "I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of Nations;"{52}{genesis
 17:16.} because, not only is generic virtue divided into its proximate species, and into individuals
 subordinate to the species, as if into nations; but also because, as there are nations of living
 animals, so in a manner are there nations of things, to which virtue is a very great advantage;
 (149) for all things which are devoid and destitute of wisdom are mischievous, just as all places
 upon which the sun does not shine are of necessity dark; for it is by virtue that a farmer is able to
 pay better attention to his crops, and by virtue that a charioteer drives his chariot in the
 horse-races so as to avoid falling; and by virtue too, that a pilot and a steersman guides his vessel
 in its voyage. (150) Virtue again has caused houses, and cities, and countries to be inhabited in a
 better manner, making men competent to manage houses and cities, and fit to associate with one
 another. Virtue has also introduced most excellent laws, and has sown the seeds of peace
 everywhere; since, from the contrary habit, things of a contrary character do naturally arise--war,
 lawlessness, bad constitutions, confusion, unnecessary voyages, overthrows, that which, in
 science, is the most grievous of all diseases, namely, cunning, from which, instead of art, all kinds
 of evil artifice has flowed. Very necessarily, therefore, will virtue be divided among all nations,
 which are large and collected systems of living beings and things taken together, for the advantage
 of those who receive her.
<p>
 XXVIII. (151) Immediately afterwards it is said, "And kings of the nations shall be born of her." For
 those with whom she is pregnant and whom she brings forth are all rulers; not because they have
 been elected as such for a short period by lot, which is an uncertain thing, or by the show of hands
 of men who are for the most part bribed, but because they have been destined and appointed so
 for everlasting by nature herself. (152) And these are not my words only, but those of the most holy
 scriptures, in which certain persons are introduced as saying to Abraham, "Thou art a king from
 God among Us;"{53}{#ge 23:6.} not out of consideration for his resources (for what resources
 could a man have who was an emigrant and who had no city to inhabit, but who was wandering over
 a great extent of impassable country?), but because they saw that he had a royal disposition in his
 mind, so that they confessed, in the words of Moses, that he was the only wise king. (153) For in
 real truth the wise man is the king of those who are foolish, since he knows what he ought and what
 he ought not to do; and the temperate man is the king of the intemperate, as he has attained to no
 careless or inaccurate knowledge of what relates to choice and avoidance. Also the brave man is
 king over the cowardly, inasmuch as he has thoroughly learnt what he ought to endure and what he
 ought not. So too the just man is king of the unjust, as he is possessed of the knowledge of
 undeviating equality as to what is to be distributed. And the holy man is king over the unholy, as he
 is possessed with the most just and excellent notions of God.
<p>
 XXIX. (154) It was natural then for the mind, being puffed up by these promises, to be elated and
 raised to an undue height in its own estimation; and accordingly, by way of producing conviction in
 us, who were accustomed to hold up our heads at the slightest trifles, "it falls down and immediately
 laughs the laughter of the soul," looking mournful as to its face, but smiling in its mind a great and
 unmixed joy having entered into it: (155) and both these feelings, namely, to laugh and also to fall,
 do at the same time occur to a wise man who inherits good things beyond his expectation; the one
 being his fate, as a proof that he is not over-proud because of his thorough knowledge of his
 mortal nothingness; and the other, by way of a confirmation of his piety on account of his looking
 upon God as the sole cause of all graces and of all good things. (156) Let, then, the creature fall
 down and wear a melancholy countenance very naturally; for it has no stability in its own nature,
 and as far as that goes is easily dissolved; but let it be raised up again by God, and laugh, for he
 alone is the support and joy of it. (157) And here any one may reasonably express a doubt how it is
 possible for any one to laugh when laughter had not as yet come among one branch of the
 creation; for Isaac is laughter, who, according to the account under our consideration at present,
 was not yet born. For just as it is impossible to see without eyes, or to hear without ears, or to
 smell without nostrils, or to exert any other of the external senses without the organs adapted to
 each respectively, or to comprehend without the reason, so also it is not likely that a person can
 have laughed, if laughter had not as yet been made. (158) What, then, are we to say? Nature
 foreshows many of the things which are hereafter to happen by certain symbols. Do you not see
 how the young bird, before it commits itself to the air, is fond of fluttering its wings and shaking its
 pinions, giving a previous happy indication of its hope that it will be able to fly? (159) And have you
 never seen a lamb, or a kid, or an ox, while still young, and before his horns are as yet grown and
 noticed, if by chance any one irritates him, how he opposes him, and moves forward to defend
 himself with those parts in which nature has planted his arms for defence? (160) And in the battles
 which take place with wild beasts, the bulls do not at once gore the adversaries who are opposed
 to them, but standing well apart, and relaxing their neck in a moderate degree and bending their
 heads on one side, and looking fierce, as it were, they then, after a truce, rush on with the
 determination of persevering in the contest. And this sort of conduct those who are in the habit of
 inventing new words call "sparring," being a sort of sham attack before the real one.
<p>
 XXX. (161) And the soul is subject to many things of much the same kind. For when something
 good is hoped for it rejoices beforehand, so that in a manner it rejoices before its joy, and is
 delighted before its delight. And one may also compare this to what happens with respect to plants;
 for they, too, when they are about to bear fruit, bud beforehand and flower previously, and are
 green previously. (162) Look at the cultivated vine, how marvellously it is furnished by nature with
 young shoots, and tendrils, and suckers, and leaves redolent of wine, which, though they utter no
 voice, do nevertheless indicate the joy of the tree at the coming fruit. And the day also laughs in
 anticipation of the early dawn, when the sun is about to rise; for one ray is a messenger of
 another, and one beam of light, as the forerunner of another though more obscure, is still a herald
 of that which shall be brighter. (163) Therefore, joy accompanies a good when it is already arrived,
 and hope while it is expected. For we rejoice when it is come, and we hope while it is coming; just
 as in the case also with the contrary feelings; for the presence of evil brings us grief, and the
 expectation of evil generates fear, and fear is nothing more than grief before grief, as hope is joy
 before joy. For the same relation that, I imagine, fear bears to grief, that same does hope bear to
 joy. (164) And the external senses afford very manifest proofs of what has now been said; for
 smell, sitting as it were in front of taste, pronounces judgment beforehand on almost every thing
 which is eaten and drunk; from which fact some persons have very felicitously named it the
 foretaster, having a regard to its employment. And so hope is by nature adapted to have as it were
 a foretaste of the coming good: and to represent it to the soul, which is to have a firm possession
 of it. (165) Moreover, when any one who is engaged in a journey is hungry or thirsty, if he on a
 sudden sees a fountain or all kinds of trees weighed down with eatable fruits, he is at once filled
 with a hope of enjoyment, not only before he has either eaten or drunk, but before he has either
 come near them or gathered of them. And do we then think that we are able to feast on the
 nourishment of the body before we receive it, but that the food of the mind is not able to render us
 cheerful beforehand, even when we are on the very point of feasting on it?
<p>
 XXXI. (166) He laughed then very naturally, even though laughter did not as yet appear to have
 been scattered among the human race: and not only did he laugh but the woman also laughed; for it
 is said presently, "And Sarrah laughed in herself, saying, There has never up to the present time
 come any good unto me of its own accord without care on my part; but he who has promised is my
 Lord, and is older than all creation, and him I must of necessity believe." (167) And at the same
 time it also teaches us that virtue is naturally a thing to be rejoiced at, and that he who possesses it
 is at all times rejoiced; and, on the contrary, that vice is a painful thing, and that he who possesses
 that is most miserable. And do we even now marvel at those philosophers who affirm that virtue
 consists in apathy? (168) For, behold, Moses is found to be the leader of this wise doctrine, as he
 represents the good man as rejoicing and laughing. And in other passages he not only speaks of
 him in that way, but also of all those who come to the same place with him; for he says, "And when
 he seeth thee he will rejoice in Himself;"{54}{#ex 4:14.} as if the bare sight of a good man were by
 itself sufficient to fill the mind with cheerfulness while the soul would cast off its most fearful burden,
 sorrow. (169) But it is not allowed to every wicked man to rejoice, as it is said in the predictions of
 the prophet, "There is no rejoicing for the wicked, says God."{55}{#isa 47:22.} For this is truly a
 divine saying and oracle, that the life of every wicked man is melancholy, and sad, and full of
 unhappiness, even if with his face he pretends to feel happiness; (170) for I should not say that the
 Egyptians rejoiced in reality when they heard that the brethren of Joseph were come, but that they
 only feigned joy, putting on a false appearance like hypocrites; for no convictor, when standing by
 and pressing upon a foolish man is a pleasure to him, just as no physician is to an intemperate
 man who is sick; for labour attends on what is useful, and laziness on what is hurtful. And those
 who prefer laziness to labour are very naturally hated by those who advise them to a course which
 will be useful and laborious. (171) When, therefore, you hear that "Pharaoh and all his servants
 rejoiced on account of the arrival of Joseph's Brethren,"{56}{#ge 45:16.} do not think that they
 rejoiced in reality, unless perhaps in this sense, that they expected that he would become changed
 from the good things of the soul in which he had been brought up, and would come over to the
 profitless appetites of the body, having adulterated the ancient and hereditary coinage of that virtue
 which was akin to him.
<p>
 XXXII. (172) The mind, then, which is devoted to pleasure, having entertained these hopes, does
 not think that it is sufficient to attract the younger men, and those who are as yet only attending the
 school of temperance, by its allurements; but it looks upon it as a terrible thing, if it cannot also
 bring over the elder reasoning, the more impetuous passions of which have now passed their
 prime; (173) for in a subsequent passage Joseph says to them, proposing injuries to them as
 though they were benefits, "Now, therefore, bringing with you your father and all your possessions,
 come hither to Me;"{57}{#ge 45:18.} speaking in this way of Egypt and of that terrible king who
 drags back all our paternal inheritance and the good things which really belong to us and which
 have advanced beyond the body (for by nature they are free), endeavoring by force to surrender
 them to a very bitter prison, having, as the holy scripture tells us, "appointed as guardian of the
 prison Pentaphres, the eunuch and chief Cook,"{58}{#ge 39:1.} who was a man in great want of all
 that is good, and who had been deprived of the generative parts of the soul; and who was also
 unable to sow and to plant any of those things which bear upon instruction; but who like a cook slew
 the living animals, and cut them up and divided them in different portions limb by limb, and who
 wallowed about in dead and lifeless bodies and things equally, and who, by his superfluous
 preparations and refinements, excited and stirred up the appetites of the profitless passions, while
 it was natural to expect that those who were able to tame them should mollify. (174) And he also
 says, "I will give unto you all the good things of Egypt, and you shall eat of the marrow of the
 Earth."{59}{#ge 45:18.} But we will say unto him, We who keep our eyes fixed on the good things of
 the soul do not desire those of the body. For that most delicious desire of the former things, when
 once implanted in the mind, is well calculated to engender a forgetfulness of all those things which
 are dear to the flesh.
<p>
 XXXIII. (175) Something like this, then, is the falsely named joy of the foolish. But the true joy has
 already been described, which is adapted only to the virtuous, "Therefore, falling down he
 Laughed."{60}{#ge 17:17.} Not falling from God, but from himself; for he stood near the
 unchangeable God, but he fell from his own vain opinion. (176) On which account that pride which
 was wise in its own conceit, having been thrown down, and the feeling which is devoted to God
 having been raised in its place, and been established around the only unalterable being, he,
 immediately laughing, said in his mind, "Shall a child be born to one who is a hundred years old, and
 shall Sarrah, who is ninety years old, have a child?" (177) Do not fancy, my good friend, that the
 word, "he said" not with his mouth but "in his Mind,"{61}{#ge 17:20.} has been added for no
 especial use; on the contrary, it is inserted with great accuracy and propriety. Why so? Because it
 seems by his saying, "Shall a child be born to him who is a hundred years old?" that he had a doubt
 about the birth of Isaac, in which he was previously stated to believe; as what was predicted a little
 before showed, speaking thus, "This child shall not be thy heir, but he who shall come out of thee;"
 and immediately afterward he says, "Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for
 righteousness." (178) Since then it was not consistent for one who had already believed to doubt,
 he has represented the doubt as of no long continuance, extending only as far as the mouth of the
 tongue, and stopping there at the mind which is endowed with such celerity of motion; for, says the
 scripture, "he said in his mind," which nothing, and no person ever so celebrated for swiftness of
 foot, could ever be able to outstrip, since it outruns even all the winged natures; (179) on which
 account the most illustrious of all of the Greek poets appears to me to have said:--
<p>
 "Swift as a winged bird or fleeter Thought."{62}{homer, Odyssey 8.171.}
<p>
 Showing by these words the exceeding speed of its promptitude, placing the thought after the
 winged bird as a sort of climax; for the mind advances at the same moment to very many things
 and bodies, hurrying on with indescribable impetuosity, and without a moment's lapse of time it
 speeds at once to the borders of both earth and sea, bringing together and dividing infinite
 magnitudes by a single word; and at the same time it soars to such a height above the earth, that it
 penetrates through the air and reaches even the aether, and scarcely stops at the very furthest
 circle of the fixed stars. (180) For the fervid and glowing heat of that region does not suffer to to
 rest tranquil; on which account, overleaping many things, it is borne far beyond every boundary
 perceptible by the outward senses, to that which is compounded of ideas and appearances by the
 law of kindred. On which account in the good man there is a slight change, indivisible,
 unapportionable, not perceptible by the outward senses, but only by the intellect, and being in a
 manner independent of them.
<p>
 XXXIV. (181) But, perhaps, some one may say, What then? is he who has once believed bound
 never to admit the slightest trace, or shadow, or moment of incredulity at all? But this man appears
 to me to have nothing else in his mind except an idea of proving the creature uncreated, and the
 mortal immortal, and the corruptible incorruptible, and man, if it be lawful to say so, God. (182) For
 he says that the belief which man has once conceived ought to be so firm as in no respect to differ
 from that which is entertained of the truly living God and which is complete in every part; for Moses,
 in his greater hymn, says, "God is faithful, and there is no unrighteousness in Him."{63}{deuteronomy
 32:4.} (183) And it is great folly to fancy that the soul of man is able to contain the virtues of God,
 which never vary and which are established on the most solid footing; for it is sufficient, and one
 must be content to have been able to acquire the images of them, though they are inferior to the
 archetypal patterns by many and large numbers. (184) And is not this reasonable? for it follows of
 necessity that the virtues of God must be pure and unmixed, since God is not a compound being,
 inasmuch as he is a single nature; on the other hand, the virtues of men must be mixed with some
 alloy, since we ourselves are compounds, the divine and human nature being combined in us, and
 adapted together according to the principles of perfect music; and that which is composed of many
 separate things has a natural attraction to each of its parts. (185) But he is happy to whom it has
 happened that for the greater portion of his life he has inclined towards the more excellent and
 more divine part; for that he should have done so all his life is impossible, since at times the mortal
 weight which is opposed to him has preponderated in the opposite scale, and impending over his
 mind, has kept watch for the opportunities of coming upon his reason at an unfavourable time, so
 as to drag it back again.
<p>
 XXXV. (186) Abraham therefore believed in God; but he believed as a man; that you may be aware
 of the peculiar attribute of mortals, and may learn that his fall did not happen to him in any other
 way than in consequence of the ordinances of nature. And if it was of short duration and only
 momentary, it is a thing to be thankful for: for many other men have been so overturned by the
 violence and impetuosity of error, and by its irresistible force, that they have been utterly destroyed
 for ever. (187) For know, my good man, that, according to the most holy Moses, virtue is not
 perfect in the human body, but it suffers something like torpor, and is often ever so little lame. For
 says the scripture, "The broader part of his thigh became torpid, on which he was Lame."{64}{genesis
 32:25.} (188) And perhaps some man of an over-confident disposition may come forward and say
 that this is not the language of one who disbelieves, but of one praying, so that if that most
 excellent of all the happy feelings were about to be produced, it would not be brought forth
 according to any other number than that of ninety years, that so the perfect good might arrive at its
 production according to perfect numbers. (189) But the aforesaid numbers are perfect, and
 especially according to the sacred scriptures. And let us consider each of them: now first of all
 there is the son of the just Noah and the ancestor of the seeing race, and he is said to have been
 a hundred years old when he begat Arphaxad, {65}{#ge 11:10.} and the meaning of the name of
 Arphaxad is, "he disturbed sorrow." At all events it is a good thing that the offspring of the soul
 should confuse, and disorder, and destroy that miserable thing iniquity, so full of evils. (190) But
 Abraham also planted a field, {66}{#ge 21:33.} using the ratio of an hundred for the measurement
 of the ground: and Isaac found some barley yielding a hundred Fold.{67}{#ge 26:12.} And Moses
 also made the vestibule of the sacred tabernacle in a hundred arches, {68}{#ex 27:9.} measuring
 out the distance towards the east and towards the west. (191) Moreover the ratio of a hundred is
 the first fruit of the first fruit which the Levites assign to those who are consecrated to the
 priesthood; {69}{#nu 18:28.} for after they have taken the tenth from the nation they are enjoined
 to give unto the priests a sacred tenth of the whole share, as if from their own possessions. (192)
 And if a person were to consider, he might find many other instances to the praise of the aforesaid
 number brought forward in the law of Moses, but for the present what have been enumerated are
 sufficient. But if from the hundred you set aside the tenth part as a sacred first fruit to God who
 produces, and increases, and brings to perfection the fruit of the soul--for how can it be anything
 but perfect, inasmuch as it is on the confines between the first and the tenth, in the same manner
 in which the Holy of Holies is separated by the veil in the middle. [...]{70}{there is an hiatus in the text
 here.} by which those things which are of the same genus are divided according to the differences
 in species?
<p>
 XXXVI. (193) Therefore the good man was speaking and saying things which were really good in
 his mind. But the bad man at times interprets good things in a very excellent manner, but
 nevertheless does shameful things in a most shameful one, as Shechem does who is the offspring
 of folly. For he is the son of Hamon his father, and the name Hamon, being translated, means "an
 ass," but the Shechem means "a shoulder" when interpreted, the symbol of labour. But that labour
 of which folly is the parent is miserable and full of suffering, as, on the other hand, that labour is
 useful to which prudence is related. (194) Accordingly the holy scriptures tell us that, "Shechem
 spake according to the mind of the virgin, having first humbled Her."{71}{#ge 34:3.} It is not said
 then, with great purpose and accuracy, that he spake according to the mind of the damsel, for the
 purpose of showing distinctly that he acted in a contrary manner to that in which he spoke? For
 Dinah means "incorruptible judgment:" justice the attribute seated by God, the everlasting virgin; for
 the name Dinah, being interpreted, means either thing, "judgment" or "justice." (195) Fools, then,
 laying violent hands upon and attempting to defile her, by means of their daily designs and
 practices, by their plausibility of speech escape conviction. Therefore they must either act in a
 manner consistent with the language that they hold, or else they must hold their tongues while
 committing iniquity. For it is said, "Silence is one half of evil:" as Moses says when rebuking the
 man who accounted the creature worthy of the principal honour, and the immortal God worthy only
 of the second place, "Thou has sinned, be silent." (196) For to use bombastic language, and to
 boast of one's evil deeds, is a double sin: and men in general are very prone to this; for they are
 constantly saying what is pleasing to the ever-virgin virtue, and such things as are just: but they
 never omit any opportunity of insulting and violating her when they are able. For what city is there
 which is not full of those who are continually celebrating the praises of virtue?--(197) men who
 weary the ears of those who hear them by everlastingly dwelling on such subjects as these;
 wisdom is a necessary good; folly is pernicious; temperance is desirable; intemperance is hateful;
 courage is a thing proper to be cultivated; cowardice must be avoided; justice is advantageous;
 injustice is disadvantageous; holiness is honourable; unholiness is shameful; piety towards the
 gods is praiseworthy; impiety is blameable; that which is most akin to the nature of man is to
 design, and to act, and to speak virtuously; that which is most alien from his nature is to do the
 contrary of all these things. (198) By continually stringing together these and similar aphorisms
 they deceive the courts of justice, and the council chambers, and the theatres, and every assembly
 and company which they meet; as men who put beautiful masks on ugly faces, with the intention of
 not being discovered by those who see them. (199) But it is of no use; for some persons will come
 endowed with great vigour, and occupied with a real zeal and admiration for virtue, and who will
 strip them of all their coverings, and disguises, and appendages which they had woven round
 themselves by the evil artifice of plausible speeches, and will display their soul naked by itself as it
 really is, and will make themselves acquainted with the secret things of their nature which are
 hidden as it were in recesses. And then having brought to light all its shame and all the reproaches
 to which it is liable, they will display them in broad daylight to every one, and show what sort of thing
 it is, how disgraceful and ridiculous, and what a spurious kind of beauty it has disguised itself with
 by means of its appendages and coverings. (200) And those who are prepared to avenge
 themselves on such profane and impure dispositions are Simeon and Levi, {72}{#de 33:6.} two
 indeed in number, but only one in mind; on which account, in his blessings of his sons, their father
 numbers them together under one classification, on account of the harmonious character of their
 unanimity and of their violence in one and the same direction. But Moses does not make any
 mention of them afterwards as a pair, but classes the whole tribe of Simeon under that of Levi,
 combining together two essences, of which he made one impressed as it were with one idea and
 appearance, hearing to doing.
<p>
 XXXVII. (201) When, therefore, the virtuous man knew that the promise was uttering things full of
 reverence and prudent caution, according to his own mind, he admitted both these feelings into his
 breast, namely, faith in God, and incredulity as to the creature. Very naturally therefore he says,
 using the language of entreaty, "Would that this Ishmael might live before Thee,"{73}{#ge 17:18.}
 using each word of those which he utters here with deliberate propriety, namely, the "this," the
 "might live," the "before thee." (202) For it is no small number of persons who have been deceived
 by the similarity of the names of different things, and we had better examine here what I am saying.
 The name of Ishmael, being interpreted, means "the hearing of God," but some men listen to the
 divine doctrines to their benefit, and others listen to both his admonitions and to those of others
 only to their destruction. Do you recollect the case of the soothsayer Balaam?{74}{#nu 24:17.}
 He is represented as hearing the oracles of God, and as having received knowledge from the
 Most High, (203) but what advantage did he reap from such hearing, and what good accrued to him
 from such knowledge? In his intention he endeavored to injure the most excellent eye of the soul,
 which alone has received such instruction as to be able to behold God, but he was unable to do so
 by reason of the invincible power of the Saviour; therefore, being overthrown by his own insane
 wickedness, and having received many wounds, he perished amid the heaps of
 wounded, {75}{#nu 31:8.} because he had stamped beforehand the divinely inspired prophecies
 with the sophistry of the soothsayers. (204) Very righteously, therefore, does the good man pray
 that this his only son, Ishmael, may be sound in mind and health, because of those persons who do
 not listen in a sincere spirit to the sacred admonitions, whom Moses has expressly forbidden to
 come into the assembly of the Ruler of the universe, (205) for those men are broken as to the
 generative parts of their minds, or are even rendered completely impotent in that respect, who
 magnify their own minds, and their external sense, as the only causes of all the events which take
 place among men; and there are others who are lovers of a system of polytheism, and who honour
 the company which is devoted to the service of many gods, being the sons of a harlot, having no
 knowledge of the one husband and father of the virtue-loving soul, namely, God; and are not all
 these men very properly driven away and banished from the assembly of God? (206) They appear
 to me very much to resemble those parents who accuse their sons of intemperance in wine, for
 they say, "This our son is Disobedient,"{76}{#de 21:20.} indicating, by the addition of the word
 "this," that they have other sons likewise who are temperate and self-denying, and who obey the
 injunctions of right reason and instruction; for these are the most genuine parents, by whom it is a
 most disgraceful thing to be accused, and a most glorious thing to be praised. (207) Then as to the
 words, "This is Aaron and Moses, whom God directed to lead the children of Israel out of
 Egypt,"{77}{#ex 6:26.} and the expression, "These are those who conversed with Pharaoh the
 king." Let us not think that they are used superfluously, or that they do not convey some intimations
 beyond the mere open meaning of the words; (208) for since Moses is the purest mind, and Aaron
 is his speech, and moreover, since the mind has been taught to think of divine things in a divine
 manner, and since the speech has learnt to interpret holy things in holy language, the sophists
 imitating them, and adulterating the genuine coinage, say, that they also conceive rightly, and
 speak in a praiseworthy manner about what is most excellent. In order, therefore, that we may not
 be deceived by a placing of the base money in juxtaposition with the good, by reason of the
 similitude of the impression, he has given us a test by which they may be distinguished. (209) What
 then is the test? To bring out of the region of the body the mind, endowed with the power of seeing,
 fond of contemplation and philosophical; for he who can do this is the same Moses; and he who is
 unable really to do so, but who is only said to be able, and who makes professions with infinite
 pomp and magnitude of language, is laughed at. But he prays that Ishmael may live, not meaning to
 refer to the life in conjunction with the body, but he prays that the divine voice, dwelling for
 evermore in his soul, may awaken and vivify it.
<p>
 XXXVIII. (210) And he indeed prays that the hearing of sacred words and the learning of sacred
 doctrine may live, as has been already said; but Jacob, the practiser of virtue, prays that the good
 natural disposition may live; for he says, "May Reuben live and not Die,"{78}{#de 33:6.} does
 he then here pray for immortality for him, a thing impossible for man to attain to? (211) Surely not,
 we must then explain what it is which he intends to signify. All the lessons and all the admonitions of
 instruction are built up and established on the nature which is calculated to receive instruction, as
 on a foundation previously laid; but if there is no natural foundation previously in existence,
 everything is useless; for men, by nature destitute of sense, would not appear at all to differ from a
 stock or a lifeless stone; for nothing could possibly be adapted to them so as to cleave to them, but
 everything would rebound and spring back as from some hard body. (212) But on the other hand,
 we may see the souls of those who are well endowed by nature, like a well-smooth waxen tablet,
 neither too solid nor too tender, moderately tempered, and easily receiving all admonitions and all
 lessons, and themselves giving an accurate representation of any impression which has been
 stamped upon them, being a sort of distinct image of memory. (213) It was therefore indispensable
 to pray that a good natural disposition, free from all disease and from all mortality, should be joined
 to the rational race; for they are but few who partake of the life according to virtue, which is the
 most real and genuine life. I do not mean of the common herd of men only, for of them there is not
 one who partakes of real life: but even of those to whom it has been granted to shun the objects of
 human desire, and to live to God alone. (214) On which account the practiser of virtue, that
 courageous man, marvelled greatly, if any one being borne along the middle of the stream of life,
 was not dragged down by any violence, but was able to withstand the flow of abundant wealth
 coming over him, and to stem the impetuosity of immoderate pleasure, and to avoid being carried
 away by the whirlwind of vain opinion. (215) At all events Jacob does not speak to Joseph more
 than the sacred scripture speaks to every one who is vigorous in his body, and who is seen to be
 immersed amid abundant treasures, and riches, and superfluities, and to be overcome by none of
 them, when he says, "For still thou livest," uttering a most marvellous sentiment, and one which is
 quite beyond the daily life of us who, if we have fallen in with ever so slight a breeze which bears us
 towards the good fortune, immediately set all sail and became greatly elated, and being full of great
 and high spirits, hurry forward with all our speed to the indulgence of our passions, and never will
 check our unbridled and immoderately excited desires until we run ashore and are wrecked as to
 the whole vessel of our souls.
<p>
 XXXIX. (216) Very beautifully therefore, do we pray that this Ishmael may live. Therefore, Abraham
 adds, "May he live before God," looking upon it as the perfection of all happiness for the mind to be
 accounted worthy of him who is the most excellent of all beings, as its inspector and overseer;
 (217) for if, while the teacher is present the pupil cannot go wrong, and if a monitor being at hand is
 of service to the learner, and if while an elder person is present the younger man is adorned by
 modesty and temperance, and if the presence of his father or of his mother have often prevented
 a son when about to commit sin, even though they are only beheld by him in silence, then what
 excess of good must we imagine that man to enjoy, who believes that he is always watched and
 beheld by God? for while he fears and reverences and looks up to the dignity of him as being
 present, he will flee from committing iniquity with all his might. (218) But when he prays that Ishmael
 may live, he does not despair of the birth of Isaac, as I have already said, but he believes in God;
 for it does not follow that what it is possible for God to give, it is also possible for man to receive,
 since to God it is easy to give the most numerous and important benefits, but to us it is not easy to
 accept of the gifts which are proffered to us; (219) for we must be content, if, by means of labour
 and diligence, we obtain a share of those good things which are familiar and customary to us. But
 there is no hope that we can attain to those which come of their own accord, and from some ever
 ready and previously prepared source, without any art, or in short, any human contrivance
 whatever; for inasmuch as these things are divine, they must of necessity be found out by more
 divine and unadulterated natures, such as have no connection with any mortal body. (220) And
 Moses has shown that every one, to the best of his power, ought to make grateful
 acknowledgments for benefits received; for instance, that the clever man ought to offer up as a
 sacrifice his acuteness and wisdom; the eloquent man should consecrate all his excellences of
 speech, by means of psalms and a regular enumeration of the greatness and panegyric on the
 living God; and to proceed with each species, he who is a natural philosopher should offer up his
 natural philosophy; he who is a moral philosopher should make an offering of his ethical
 philosophy; he who is skilful in any art or science should dedicate to God his knowledge of the arts
 and sciences. (221) Thus again a sailor and a pilot should dedicate their successful voyage; the
 agricultural farmer, his productive crops; the stock-farmer, the prolific increase of his flocks and
 herds; the physician, the good health of his patients; the commander of an army, his success in
 war; the magistrate or the king will offer up his administration of the laws or his sovereign power.
 And, in short, the man who is not blinded by self-love, looks upon the only true maker of all things,
 God, as the cause of all the good things affecting his soul, or body, or his external circumstances.
 (222) Let no one therefore, of those who seem to be somewhat obscure and humble, from a
 despair of any better hope, hesitate to become a suppliant to God. But even if he no longer looks
 forward to any great advantages, still let him, to the best of his power, give God thanks for the
 blessings which he has already received, (223) and in effect, those which he has received are
 countless; his birth, his life, his soul, his food, his outward senses, his imagination, his inclinations,
 his reason; and reason is a very short word, but a most perfect and admirable thing, a fragment of
 the soul of the universe, or, as it is more pious to say for those who study philosophy according to
 Moses, a very faithful copy of the divine image.
<p>
 XL. (224) It is right also to praise those inquirers after truth, who have endeavored to tear up and
 carry off the whole trunk of virtue, root and branch: but since they have not been able to do it, have
 at least taken either a single shoot, or a single bunch of fruit, as a specimen and portion of the
 whole tree, being all that they were able to Bear.{79}{#nu 13:25.} (225) It is a desirable thing,
 indeed, to associate at once with the entire company of the virtues; but if this be too great an
 indulgence to be granted to human nature, let us be content if it has fallen to our lot to be
 connected with any one of the particular virtues, as a portion of the whole band, such as
 temperance, or courage, or justice, or humanity; for the soul may produce and bring forth some
 good from even one of them, and so avoid being barren and unproductive of any. (226) But will you
 impose any such injunctions as these on your own son? Unless you treat your servants with
 gentleness, do not treat those of the same rank as yourself socially. Unless you behave
 decorously to your wife, never bear yourself respectfully to your parents. If you neglect your father
 and your mother, be impious also towards God. If you delight in pleasure, you must not keep aloof
 from covetousness. Do you desire great riches? Then be also eager for vain-glory. (227) For what
 more need we add? Need you not desire to be moderate in some things unless you are able to be
 so in all? Would not your son say to you in such a case, My father, what do you mean? Do you
 wish your son to become either perfectly good or perfectly bad, and will you not be content if he
 keeps the middle path between the two extremes? (228) Was it not for this reason that Abraham
 also, at the time of the destruction of Sodom, began at fifty and ended at Ten?{80}{#ge 18:32.}
 Therefore, propitiating and supplicating God, entreat him that if there could be found among his
 creatures a complete remission so as to give them liberty, of which the sacred number of fifty is a
 symbol, at least the intermediate instruction which is equal in number to the decade, might be
 accepted for the sake of the deliverance of the soul which was about to be condemned. (229) But
 those who are instructed have many more opportunities of prayer than those who are destitute of
 teachers, and those who are well initiated in encyclical accomplishments have more opportunities
 than those who are unmusical and illiterate, inasmuch as they from their childhood almost have
 been imbued with all the lessons of virtue, and temperance, and all kinds of excellence. Wherefore,
 even if they have not entirely got rid of and effaced old marks of iniquity so as to wear a completely
 clean appearance, at least they have purified themselves in a reasonable and moderate degree.
 (230) And it is something like this that Esau seems to have said to his father, "Have you not one
 blessing for me, O my father? Bless me, bless me, also, O my Father!"{81}{#ge 27:28.} For
 different blessings have been set apart for different persons, perfect blessings for the perfect, and
 moderate blessings for the imperfect. As is the case also with bodies; for there are different
 exercises appropriate to those which are in health, and to those which are sick. And also different
 regimens of food, and different systems of living, and not the same. But some things are suitable to
 the one kind that they may not become at all diseased; and other things are good for the other sort,
 they they may be changed and rendered more healthy. (231) Since, therefore, there are many
 good things existing in nature, give me that which appears to be best adapted to my
 circumstances, even if it be the most trifling thing possible; looking at this one point alone, whether I
 shall be able to bear what is given me with equanimity, and not, like a wretched person, sink under
 and be overwhelmed by it. (232) Again, what do we imagine to be meant by the words, "Will not the
 hand of the Lord be Sufficient?"{82}{#nu 11:23.} Do they not signify that the powers of the living
 God penetrate everywhere for the purpose of conferring benefits, not only on those who are noble,
 but on those also who appear to be in a more obscure condition, to whom also God gives such
 things as are suitable to the measure and weight of the soul of each individual, conjecturing and
 measuring in his own mind with perfect equality what is proportionate to the circumstances and
 requirements of each.
<p>
 XLI. (233) But what makes an impression on me in no ordinary degree is the law which is enacted
 with respect to those who put off their sins and seem to be repentant. For this law commands that
 the first victim which such persons offer shall be a female sheep without spot. But, if it proceeds,
 "his hand is not strong enough to bring a sheep, then for the trespass which he has committed he
 shall bring two turtle doves or two young pigeons, one for his trespass and one for a burnt offering;
 (234) and if his hand cannot find a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as
 his gift the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not pour oil upon it, nor
 shall he place any frankincense thereon, because it is a sin offering; and he shall bring it to the
 priest, and the priest having taken it from him shall take a full handful of it, and place it as a
 memorial on the Altar."{83}{#le 5:5.} (235) God therefore here is propitiated by three different
 kinds of repentance, by the aforesaid beasts, or by the birds, or by the while flour, according, in
 short, to the ability of him who is being purified and who repents. For small offences do not require
 great purifications, nor are small purifications fit for great crimes; but they should be equal, and
 similar, and in due proportion. (236) It is worth while, therefore, to examine what is meant by this
 purification which may be accomplished in three ways. Now it may almost be said that both
 offences and good actions are perceived to exist in three things; in intention, or in words, or in
 actions. On which account Moses, teaching in his hortatory admonitions that the attainment of
 good is not impossible nor even very difficult, says, (237) "It is not necessary to soar up to heaven,
 nor to go to the borders of the earth and sea, for the attainment of it, but it is near, yea, and very
 Near."{84}{#de 30:10.} And then in a subsequent passage he shows it all but to the naked eye
 as one may say, where he says, "Every action is in thy mouth, or in thy heart, or in thy
 Hands:"{85}{#de 30:14.} meaning under this symbolical expression, in thy words, or in they
 designs, or in thy actions. For he means that human happiness consists in wise design, and good
 language, and righteous actions, just as the unhappiness arises from the contrary course. (238)
 For both well-doing and wrong-doing exist in the same regions, in the heart, or in the mouth, or in
 the hand; for some persons decide in the most righteous, and sagacious manner, some speak
 most excellently, some do only what ought to be done: again, of the three sources of error the most
 unimportant is to design to do what ought not to be done, the most grievous is to do what is
 iniquitous, the middle evil is to speak improperly. (239) But it often happens that even what is least
 important is the most difficult to be removed; for it is very hard to bring an agitated state of the soul
 to tranquillity; and one may more easily check the impetuosity of a torrent than the perversion of
 the soul which is hurrying in a wrong direction, without restraint. For innumerable notions coming
 one upon the other like the waves of a stormy sea, bearing everything along with them, and
 throwing everything into confusion, overturn the whole soul with irresistible violence. (240)
 Therefore the most excellent, and most perfect kind of purification is this, not to admit into one's
 mind any improper notions, but to regulate it in peace and obedience to law, the ruler of which
 principles is justice. The next kind is, not to offend in one's language either by speaking falsely, or
 by swearing falsely, or by deceiving, or by practicing sophistry, or by laying false informations; or,
 in short, by letting loose one's mouth and tongue to the injury of any one, as it is better to put a
 bridle and an insuperable chain on those members.
<p>
 XLII. (241) But why it is a more grievous offence to say what is wrong than only to think it, is very
 easy to see. For some times a person thinks without any deliberate previous intention of so
 thinking, but inconsiderately: for he is compelled to admit ideas in his mind which he does not wish
 to admit; and nothing which is involuntary is blameable: (242) but a man speaks intentionally, so
 that if he utters words which are not proper he is unhappy and is committing offence, since he
 does not even by chance choose to say anything that is proper, and it would be more for his
 advantage to adopt that safest expedient of silence: and, in the second place, anyone who is not
 silent can be silent if he pleases. (243) But what is even a still more grievous offence than
 speaking wrongly, is unjust action. For the word, as it is said, is the shadow of the deed; and how
 can an injurious deed help being more mischievous than a shadow of the same character? On this
 account Moses released the mind, even when it yielded to many involuntary perversions and
 errors, from accusations and from penalties, thinking that it was rather acted upon by notions
 which forced their way into it, than was itself acting. But whatever goes out through the mouth that
 he makes the utterer responsible for and brings him before the tribunal, since the act of speaking
 is one which is in our own power. (244) But the investigation to which words are subject is a much
 more moderate one, and that with which words are united is a more vigorous one. For he imposes
 severe punishments on those who commit gross offences, and who carry out in action, and utter
 with hasty tongues what they have been designed in their unjust minds.
<p>
 XLIII. (245) Therefore he has called the purifying victims which are to be offered up for the three
 offenders, the mind, speech, and the action, a sheep, and a pair of turtle doves or pigeons, and the
 tenth part of a sacred measure of fine flour; thinking it fit that the mind should be purified by a
 sheep, the speech by winged creatures, and the action by fine flour: Why is this? (246) Because,
 as the mind is the most excellent thing in us, so also is the sheep the most excellent among
 irrational animals, inasmuch as it is most gentle, and also as it gives forth a yearly produce in its
 fleece, for the use and also for the ornament of mankind. For clothes keep off all injury from both
 cold and heat, and also they conceal the unmentionable parts of nature, and in this way they are an
 ornament to those who use them: (247) therefore the sheep, as being the most excellent of
 animals, is a symbol of the purification of the most excellent part of man, the mind. And birds are
 an emblem of the purification of speech: for speech is a light thing, and winged by nature, flying and
 penetrating in every direction more swiftly than an arrow. For what is once said can never be
 re-called; {86}{this resembles what is said by Horace in A. P. 390 and in Epist. I. 18.71.} but being borne abroad,
 and running on with great swiftness, it strikes the ears and penetrates every sense of hearing,
 resounding loudly: but speech is of two kinds, one true and the other false; (248) on which account
 it appears to me to be here compared to a pair of turtle doves or young pigeons: and of these birds
 one he says is to be looked upon as a sin offering, since the speech which is true is wholly and in
 all respects sacred and perfect, but that which is false is very wrong and requires correction. (249)
 Again, as I have already said, fine flour is a symbol of the purification of activity, but it is sorted
 from the commoner sort by the hands of the bakers, who make the business their study. On which
 account the law says, "And the priest having taken an entire handful, shall place it on the altar as a
 memorial of them," by the word handful, indicating both the endeavor and the action. (250) And he
 speaks with exceeding accuracy with respect to the sheep, when he says, "And if his hand be not
 strong enough to supply a sheep;" but with respect to the birds he says, "And if he cannot find a
 bird." Why is this? Because it is a sign of very great strength and of excessive power, to get rid of
 the errors of the mind: but it does not require any great strength, to check the errors of words;
 (251) for, as I have said already, silence is a remedy for all the offences that can be committed by
 the voice, and every one may easily practise silence; but yet, by reason of their chattering habits
 and want of moderation in their language, many people cannot find out how to impose a limitation
 on their speech.
<p>
 XLIV. (252) Since the, the virtuous man has been bred up among and practised in these and
 similar divisions and discriminations of things, does he not rightly appear to pray that Ishmael may
 live, if he is not as yet able to become the father of Isaac? (253) What then does the merciful God
 say? To him who asks for one thing he gives two, and on him who prays for what is less he
 bestows what is greater; for, says the historian, he said unto Abraham, "Yea, behold, Sarrah thy
 wife shall bring forth a Son."{87}{#ge 17:19.} Very felicitous and significant is this answer, "Yea;"
 for what can be more suitable to and more like the character of God, than to promise good things
 and to ratify that promise with all speed! (254) But what God promises every foolish man
 repudiates; therefore the sacred scriptures represent Leah as hated, and on this account it is that
 she received that name; for Leah, being interpreted, means "repudiating and labouring," because
 we all turn away from virtue and think it a laborious thing, by reason of its very often imposing
 commands on us which are not pleasant. (255) But nevertheless, she is thought worthy of such an
 honourable reception from the prince, that her womb is opened by him, so as to receive the seed
 of divine generation, in order to cause the production of honourable pursuits and actions. Learn
 therefore, O soul, that Sarrah, that is, virtue, will bring forth to thee a son; and that Hagar, or
 intermediate instruction, is not the only one who will do so; for her offspring is one which has its
 knowledge from teaching, but the offspring of the other is entirely self-taught. (256) And do not
 wonder, if God, who brings forth all good things, has also brought forth this race, which, though rare
 upon the earth, is very numerous in heaven. And you may learn this also from other things of which
 man consists: do the eyes see from having been taught to do so? And what do the nostrils do? Do
 they smell by reason of their having learnt? And do the hands touch, or the feet advance, in
 accordance with the commands or recommendations of instructors? (257) Again, do the appetites
 and imaginations (and these are the first moving powers and persuasions of the soul) exist in
 consequence of teaching? And has our mind gone as a pupil to any sophist, in order to learn to
 think and to comprehend? All these things repudiate all kinds of instruction, and avail themselves
 only of the spontaneous gifts of nature to exert their appropriate energies. (258) Why then do you
 any longer wonder if God showers upon men virtue, unaccompanied by any labour or suffering,
 such as stand in need of no superintending care or instruction, but is from the very beginning entire
 and perfect? And if you wish to receive any testimony in corroboration of this view, can you find
 any more trustworthy than that of Moses? And he says that the rest of mankind derive their food
 from earth, but that he alone who is endowed with the power of sight, derives his from heaven.
 (259) And men occupied in agriculture co-operate to produce the food from the earth; but God, the
 only cause and giver, rains down the food from heaven without the cooperation of any other being.
 And, indeed, we read in the scriptures, "Behold, I rain upon you bread from Heaven."{88}{#ex 16:4.}
 Now what nourishment can the scriptures properly say is rained down, except heavenly wisdom?
 (260) which God sends from above upon those souls which have a longing for virtue, God who
 possesses a great abundance and exceeding treasure of wisdom, and who irrigates the universe,
 and especially so on the sacred seventh day which he calls the sabbath; for then, he says, that
 there is an influx of spontaneous good things, not rising from any kind of art, but shooting up by
 their own spontaneous and self-perfecting nature, and bearing appropriate fruit.
<p>
 XLV. (261) Virtue, therefore, will bring thee forth a legitimate male child, far removed from all
 effeminate passions; and thou shalt call the name of thy son by the name of the passion which thou
 feelest in regard to him; and thou wilt by all means feel joy; so that thou shalt give him a name which
 is an emblem of joy, namely, Laughter. (262) As grief and fear have their appropriate expressions
 which the passion, when more than usually violent and predominant, gives utterance to; so also,
 good counsels and happiness compel a man to employ a natural expression of them, for which no
 one could find out more appropriate and felicitous names, even if he were very skilful in the
 imposition of names. (263) On which account God says, "I have blessed him, I will increase him, I
 will multiply him, he shall beget twelve Nations;"{89}{#ge 17:20.} that is to say, he shall beget the
 whole circle and ring of the sophistical preliminary branches of education; but I will make my
 covenant with Israel, that the race of mankind may receive each kind of virtue, the weaker part of
 them receiving both that which is taught by others, and that which is learnt by one's self, and the
 stronger part that which is ready and prepared.
<p>
 XLVI. (264) "And at that time," says he, "she shall bring forth a son to Thee;"{90}{#ge 15:10.} that is
 to say, wisdom shall bring forth joy. What time, O most marvellous being, are you pointing out? Is it
 that which cannot be indicated by the thing brought forth? For that must be the real time, the rising
 of the universe, the prosperity and happiness of the whole earth, and of heaven, and of all
 intermediate natures, and of all animals, and of all plants. (265) On which account Moses also took
 courage to say to those who had run away, and who did not dare to enter upon a war in the cause
 of virtue against those who were arrayed against it, "The Lord has departed from them, but the
 Lord is in Us;"{91}{#nu 14:9.} for he here almost confesses in express words that God is time,
 who stands aloof and at a distance from every impious person, but walks among those souls which
 cultivate virtue. (266) "For," says he, "I will walk among you, and I will be your God."{92}{leviticus
 26:12.} But those who say that what is meant by time is only the seasons of the year are misapplying
 the names with great inaccuracy, like men who have not studied the nature of things with any care,
 but have gone on to a great degree at random.
<p>
 XLVII. (267) But by way of amplifying the beauty of the creature to be born, he says that it shall be
 born the next year, indicating by the term, "the next Year,"{93}{#ge 18:10.} not a difference of time,
 such as is measured by lunar or solar periods, but that which is truly marvellous, and strange, and
 new, being an age which is very different from those which are visible to the eyes and perceptible
 to the outward senses, being investigated in incorporeal things appreciable only by the intellect,
 which, in fact, is the model and archetype of time. But an age is a name given to the life of the
 world, intelligible only by the intellect, as time is that given to the life of the world, perceptible by the
 outward senses. (268) And in this year the man who had sown the graces of God so as to produce
 many more good things, in order that the greatest possible number of persons worthy to share
 them might participate in them, finds also the barley producing a Hundredfold.{94}{#ge 26:12.} But
 he who has sown does usually also reap. (269) And he sowed, displaying the virtue, the enemy of
 envy and wickedness; he is, however, here said to find, not to reap. For he who has made the ear
 of his good deeds more productive and full, was a different person, having laid up an abundance of
 greater hopes well prepared, and he also proposed more abundant advantages to all those who
 sought them, encouraging them to hope to find them.
<p>
 XLVIII. (270) And the words, "He finished speaking to Him,"{95}{#ge 17:22.} are equivalent to
 saying, he made his hearer perfect, though he was devoid of wisdom before, and he filled him with
 immortal lessons. But when his disciple became perfect, the Lord went up and departed from
 Abraham, showing, not that he separated himself from him; for the wise man is naturally an
 attendant of God, not wishing to represent the spontaneous inclination of the disciple in order that
 as he had learnt while his teacher was no longer standing by him, and without any necessity urging
 him, giving of his own accord a specimen of himself, and displaying a voluntary and spontaneous
 eagerness to learn, he might for the future exert his energies by himself; for the teacher assigns a
 model to him who has learnt by voluntary study without any suggestions from other quarters,
 stamping on him a most durable species of indelible recollection.
