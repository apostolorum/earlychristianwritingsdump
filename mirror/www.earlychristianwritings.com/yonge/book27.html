 THE SPECIAL LAWS, I*
<p>
<p>                        {**Yonge's title, A Treatise on Circumcision.}
<p>
   I. (1) The genera and heads of all special laws, which are called "the ten commandments," have
 been discussed with accuracy in the former treatise. We must now proceed to consider the
 particular commands as we read them in the subsequent passages of the holy scriptures; and we
 will begin with that which is turned into ridicule by people in general. (2) The ordinance of
 circumcision of the parts of generation is ridiculed, though it is an act which is practised to no slight
 degree among other nations also, and most especially by the Egyptians, who appear to me to be
 the most populous of all nations, and the most abounding in all kinds of wisdom. (3) In
 consequence of which it would be most fitting for men to discard childish ridicule, and to investigate
 the real causes of the ordinance with more prudence and dignity, considering the reasons why the
 custom has prevailed, and not being precipitate, so as without examination to condemn the folly of
 mighty nations, recollecting that it is not probable that so many myriads should be circumcised in
 every generation, mutilating the bodies of themselves and of their nearest relations, in a manner
 which is accompanied with severe pain, without adequate cause; but that there are many reasons
 which might encourage men to persevere and continue a custom which has been introduced by
 previous generations, and that these are from reasons of the greatest weight and importance. (4)
 First of all, that it is a preventive of a painful disease, and of an affliction difficult to be cured, which
 they call a carbuncle; {1}{the Greek word is anthrax, which also signifies a coal. The Latin, from which our carbuncle
 is derived, carbunculus, a diminutive of carbo, which also means a coal.} because, I imagine, when it becomes
 inflamed it burns; from which fact it has derived that appellation. And this disease is very apt to be
 engendered among those who have not undergone the rite of circumcision. (5) Secondly, it
 secures the cleanliness of the whole body in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God;
 with which object the Egyptian priests, being extravagant in their case, shave the whole of their
 bodies; for some of these evils which ought to be got rid of are collected in and lodge under the
 hair and the prepuce. (6) Thirdly, there is the resemblance of the part that is circumcised to the
 heart; for both parts are prepared for the sake of generation; for the breath contained within the
 heart is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself is productive of living beings.
 Therefore, the men of old thought it right to make the evident and visible organ, by which the
 objects of the outward senses are generated, resemble that invisible and superior part, by means
 of which ideas are formed. (7) The fourth, and most important, is that which relates to the provision
 thus made for prolificness; for it is said that the seminal fluid proceeds in its path easily, neither
 being at all scattered, nor flowing on its passage into what may be called the bags of the prepuce.
 On which account those nations which practise circumcision are the most prolific and the most
 populous.
<p>
 II. (8) These considerations have come to our ears, having been discussed of old among men of
 divine spirit and wisdom, who have interpreted the writings of Moses in no superficial or careless
 manner. But, besides what has been already said, I also look upon circumcision to be a symbol of
 two things of the most indispensable importance. (9) First of all, it is a symbol of the excision of the
 pleasures which delude the mind; for since, of all the delights which pleasure can afford, the
 association of man with woman is the most exquisite, it seemed good to the lawgivers to mutilate
 the organ which ministers to such connections; by which rite they signified figuratively the excision
 of all superfluous and excessive pleasure, not, indeed, of one only, but of all others whatever,
 though that one which is the most imperious of all. (10) The second thing is, that it is a symbol of a
 man's knowing himself, and discarding that terrible disease, the vain opinion of the soul; for some
 men, like good statuaries, have boasted that they can make that most beautiful animal, man; and,
 being puffed up with arrogance, have deified themselves, hiding from sight the true cause of the
 creation of all things namely, God, although they might have corrected that error from a
 consideration of other persons among whom they live; (11) for there are among them many men
 who have no children, and many barren women whose connections lead to nothing, so that they
 grow old in childlessness. We must therefore eradicate evil opinions from the mind, and all other
 ideas which are not devoted to God. This, then, is enough to say on these subjects. (12) But we
 must now turn to the special and particular laws; and first of all to those which relate to those
 people by whom it is well to be governed, those which have been enacted concerning
 Monarchy.{2}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: On Monarchy, Book I. Accordingly, his
 next paragraph begins with roman numeral I (= III in Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes with number IX (= XI in the Loeb).
 The publisher has elected to follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 III. (13) Some persons have conceived that the sun, and the moon, and the other stars are
 independent gods, to whom they have attributed the causes of all things that exist. But Moses was
 well aware that the world was created, and was like a very large city, having rulers and subjects in
 it; the rulers being all the bodies which are in heaven, such as planets and fixed stars; (14) and the
 subjects being all the natures beneath the moon, hovering in the air and adjacent to the earth. But
 that the rulers aforesaid are not independent and absolute, but are the viceroys of one supreme
 Being, the Father of all, in imitation of whom they administer with propriety and success the charge
 committed to their care, as he also presides over all created things in strict accordance with justice
 and with law. Others, on the contrary, who have not discovered the supreme Governor, who thus
 rules everything, have attributed the causes of the different things which exist in the world to the
 subordinate powers, as if they had brought them to pass by their own independent act. (15) But the
 most sacred lawgiver changes their ignorance into knowledge, speaking in the following manner:
 "Thou shalt not, when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and all the host of heaven,
 be led astray and fall down and worship Them."{3}{#de 4:19.} With great felicity and propriety
 has he here called the reception of these bodies as gods, an error; (16) for they who see that the
 different seasons of the year owe their existence to the advances and retreats of the sun, in which
 periods also the generation of animals, and plants, and fruits, are perfected according to
 well-defined times, and who see also that the moon is the servant and successor of the sun, taking
 that care and superintendence of the world by night which the sun takes by day; and also that the
 other stars, in accordance with their sympathy with things on earth, labour continually and do ten
 thousand things which contribute to the duration of the existing state of things, have been led into
 an inextricable error, imagining that these bodies are the only gods. (17) But if they had taken
 pains to travel along the straight and true road, they would soon have known that just as the
 outward sense is the subordinate minister of the mind, so in the same manner all the objects of the
 outward senses are servants of that which is appreciable only by intellect, being well contented if
 they can attain to the second place in honour. (18) But it is altogether ridiculous to imagine that the
 mind, which is the smallest thing in us, being in fact invisible, is the ruler of those organs which
 belong to the external senses, but that the greatest and most perfect ruler of the whole universe is
 not the King of kings; that the being who sees, is not the ruler of those who do not see. (19) We
 must, therefore, look on all those bodies in the heaven, which the outward sense regards as gods,
 not as independent rulers, since they are assigned the work of lieutenants, being by their intrinsic
 nature responsible to a higher power, but by reason of their virtue not actually called to render in an
 account of their doings. (20) So that, transcending all visible essence by means of our reason, let
 us press forward to the honour of that everlasting and invisible Being who can be comprehended
 and appreciated by the mind alone; who is not only the God of all gods, whether appreciable only by
 the intellect or visible to the outward senses, but is also the creator of them all. And if any one
 gives up the service due to the everlasting and uncreated God, transferring it to any more modern
 and created being, let him be set down as mad and as liable to the charge of the greatest impiety.
<p>
 IV. (21) But there are some persons who have given gold and silver to sculptors and statuaries, as
 people able to fashion gods for them. And they, taking the lifeless materials and using a mortal
 model, have (which is a most extraordinary thing) made gods, as far as appearance went, and
 have built temples and erected altars, and dedicated them to them, honouring them with excessive
 pains and diligence, with sacrifices and processions, and all kinds of other sacred ceremonies and
 purifications; the priests and priestesses exciting themselves to the very extremity of their power to
 extend this kind of pride and vanity. (22) To whom the Father of the universe thus speaks, saying:
 "You shall not make to yourselves gods of silver and Gold;"{4}{#ex 20:20.} all but teaching them in
 express words, "You shall not make to yourselves any gods whatever of this or of any other
 material, nor shall you worship anything made with hands," being forbidden expressly with respect
 to the two most excellent materials; for silver and gold are esteemed the most honourable of all
 materials. (23) And, besides this distinct prohibition, there is another meaning which appears to me
 to be intended to be figuratively conveyed under these words, which is one of very great influence
 as contributing to the formation of the moral character, and which convicts in no slight degree
 those who are covetous of money and who seek to procure silver and gold from all quarters, and
 when they have acquired it treasure it up, as though it were some divine image, in their inmost
 shrines, looking upon it as the cause of all good things and of all happiness. (24) And all the poor
 men that are possessed of that terrible disease, the love of money, but who, from not having any
 riches of their own which they can think worthy of their attention, fix their admiration on the wealth
 of their neighbours, and, for the purpose of offering adoration to it, come the first thing in the
 morning to the houses of those who have abundance, as if they were noble temples at which they
 were going to offer prayers, and to entreat blessings from their owners as if from the gods. (25)
 And to these men, Moses says, in another passage, "You shall not follow images, and you shall not
 make to yourselves molten Gods."{5}{#le 19:4.} Teaching them, by figurative language, that it is
 not right to pay such honours to wealth as one would pay to the gods; for those celebrated
 materials of wealth, silver and gold, are made to be used, which, however, the multitude follows,
 looking upon them as the only causes of wealth which is proverbially called blind, and the especial
 sources of happiness. (26) These are the things which Moses calls idols, resembling shadows and
 phantoms, and having about them nothing strong, or trustworthy, or lasting; for they are tossed
 about like the unstable wind, and are subject to all kinds of variations and changes. And the
 greatest possible proof of this is that, when people have not at all expected it, it suddenly has
 descended upon them; and, again, when they fancied that they had taken firm hold of it, it has flown
 away. And when, indeed, it is present, then images appear as in a mirror, deceiving the outward
 senses and imposing upon them with traps, and appearing as if they would last for a long time,
 while in reality they do not endure. (27) And why need I explain how unstable the wealth and pride of
 men are, which vain opinions decorate with showy colours? For, before now, some men have
 existed who have affirmed that all other animals and plants, of which there is any birth or any
 decay, are in one continual and incessant state of transition, and that the external sense of this
 transition is somewhat indistinct, inasmuch as the swiftness of nature surpasses the very quickest
 and most precise glance of the vision.
<p>
 V. (28) But not only are wealth, and glory, and all other such things, mere phantoms and
 unsubstantial images, but also all the other deceits which the inventors of fables have devised,
 puffing themselves up by reason of their ingenuity, while they have been raising a fortification of
 false opinion in opposition to the truth, bringing in God as if by some theatrical machine, in order to
 prevent the everlasting and only true existing God from being consigned to oblivion, are so
 likewise. But such men have adapted their falsehood to melodies, and rhythm, and metres, with a
 reference to what is persuasive, thinking that by these means they should easily cajole all who read
 their works. (29) Not but what they have also joined to themselves the arts of statuary and painting
 as copartners in their system of deceit, in order that, bringing over the spectators by
 well-fabricated appearances of colours, and forms, and distinctive qualities, and having won over
 by their allurements those principal outward senses of sight and hearing, the one by the exquisite
 beauty of lifeless forms, and the other by a poetical harmony of numbers--they may ravish the
 unstable soul and render it feeble, and deprive it of any settled foundation. (30) On this account,
 Moses, being well aware that pride had by that time advanced to a very high pitch of power, and
 that it was well guarded by the greater part of mankind, and that too not from compulsion but of
 their own accord, and fearing lest those men who are admirers of uncorrupted and genuine piety
 may be carried away as by a torrent, stamped a deep impression on the minds of men, engraving
 piety on them, in order that the impression he thus made might not become confused or weakened,
 so as at last to become wholly effaced by time. And he is constantly prophesying and telling his
 people that there is one God, the creator and maker of the universe; and at other time he teaches
 them that he is the Lord of all created things, since all that is firm, and solid, and really stable and
 sure, is by nature so framed as to be connected with him alone. (31) And it is said in the scriptures
 that, "Those that are attached to the living God do all Live."{6}{#de 4:4.} Is not this, then, a
 thrice happy life, a thrice blessed existence, to be contented with performing due service to the
 most venerable Cause of all things, and not to think fit to serve his subordinate ministers and
 door-keepers in preference to the King himself? And this life is an immortal one, and is recorded
 as one of great duration in the pillars of nature. And it is inevitably necessary that these writings
 should last to all eternity with the world itself.
<p>
 VI. (32) But the Father and Ruler of the universe is a being whose character it is difficult to arrive
 at by conjecture and hard to comprehend; but still we must not on that account shrink from an
 investigation of it. Now, in the investigations which are made into the nature of God, there are two
 things of the greatest importance, about which the intellect of the man who devotes himself to
 philosophy in a genuine spirit is perplexed. One is, whether there is any Deity at all? this question
 arises from the atheism (which is the greatest of all vices) of those men who study philosophy. The
 other question is, supposing there to be a God, what he is as to his essence? Now the former
 question it is not very difficult to determine; but the second is not only difficult, but perhaps
 impossible. We must, however, consider both these matters. (33) It has invariably happened that
 the works which they have made have been, in some degree, the proofs of the character of the
 workmen; for who is there who, when he looks upon statues or pictures, does not at once form an
 idea of the statuary or painter himself? And who, when he beholds a garment, or a ship, or a
 house, does not in a moment conceive a notion of the weaver, or shipbuilder, or architect, who has
 made them? And if any one comes into a well-ordered city, in which all parts of the constitution are
 exceedingly well arranged and regulated, what other idea will he entertain but that this city is
 governed by wise and virtuous rulers? (34) He, therefore, who comes into that which is truly the
 greatest of cities, namely, this world, and who beholds all the land, both the mountain and the
 champaign district full of animals, and plants, and the streams of rivers, both overflowing and
 depending on the wintry floods, and the steady flow of the sea, and the admirable temperature of
 the air, and the varieties and regular revolutions of the seasons of the year; and then too the sun
 and moon, the rulers of day and night, and the revolutions and regular motions of all the other
 planets and fixed stars, and of the whole heaven; would he not naturally, or I should rather say, of
 necessity, conceive a notion of the Father, and creator, and governor of all this system; (35) for
 there is no artificial work whatever which exists of its own accord? And the world is the most
 artificial and skilfully made of all works, as if it had been put together by some one who was
 altogether accomplished and most perfect in knowledge. It is in this way that we have received an
 idea of the existence of God.
<p>
 VII. (36) Again, even if it is very difficult to ascertain and very hard properly to comprehend, we
 must still, as far as it is possible, investigate the nature of his essence; for there is no employment
 more excellent than that of searching out the nature of the true God, even though the discovery
 may transcend all human ability, since the very desire and endeavour to comprehend it is able by
 itself to furnish indescribable pleasures and delights. (37) And the witnesses of this fact are those
 who have not merely tasted philosophy with their outermost lips, but who have abundantly feasted
 on its reasonings and its doctrines; for the reasoning of these men, being raised on high far above
 the earth, roams in the air, and soaring aloft with the sun, and moon, and all the firmament of
 heaven, being eager to behold all the things that exist therein, finds its power of vision somewhat
 indistinct from a vast quantity of unalloyed light being poured over it, so that the eye of his soul
 becomes dazzled and confused by the splendour. (38) But he does not on that account faint and
 renounce the task which he has undertaken, but goes on with invincible determination towards the
 sight which he considers attainable, as if he were a competitor at the games, and were striving for
 the second prize, though he has missed the first. And guess and conjecture are inferior to true
 perception, as are all those notions which are classed under the description of reasonable and
 plausible opinions. (39) Though, therefore, we do not know and cannot accurately ascertain what
 each of the stars is as to its pure and real essence, still we are eager to investigate the subject,
 delighting in probable reasonings, because of the fondness for learning which is implanted in our
 nature. (40) And so in the same way, though we cannot attain to a distinct conception of the truly
 living God, we still ought not to renounce the task of investigating his character, because even if we
 fail to make the discovery, the very search itself is intrinsically useful and an object of deserved
 ambition; since no one ever blames the eyes of the body because they are unable to look upon the
 sun itself, and therefore shrink from the brilliancy which is poured upon them from its beams, and
 therefore look down upon the earth, shrinking from the extreme brilliancy of the rays of the sun.
<p>
 VIII. (41) Which that interpreter of the divine word, Moses, the man most beloved by God, having a
 regard to, besought God and said, "Show me thyself"--all but urging him, and crying out in loud and
 distinct words--"that thou hast a real being and existence the whole world is my teacher, assuring
 me of the fact and instructing me as a son might of the existence of his father, or the work of the
 existence of the workman. But, though I am very desirous to know what thou art as to thy essence,
 I can find no one who is able to explain to me anything relating to this branch of learning in any part
 of the universe whatever. (42) On which account, I beg and entreat of thee to receive the
 supplication of a man who is thy suppliant and devoted to God's service, and desirous to serve
 thee alone; for as the light is not known by the agency of anything else, but is itself its own
 manifestation, so also thou must alone be able to manifest thyself. For which reason I hope to
 receive pardon, if, from want of any one to teach me, I am so bold as to flee to thee, desiring to
 receive instruction from thyself." (43) But God replied, "I receive, indeed, your eagerness,
 inasmuch as it is praiseworthy; but the request which you make is not fitting to be granted to any
 created being. And I only bestow such gifts as are appropriate to him who receives them; for it is
 not possible for a man to receive all that it is easy for me to give. On which account I give to him
 who is deserving of my favour all the gifts which he is able to receive. (44) But not only is the
 nature of mankind, but even the whole heaven and the whole world is unable to attain to an
 adequate comprehension of me. So know yourself, and be not carried away with impulses and
 desires beyond your power; and let not a desire of unattainable objects carry you away and keep
 you in suspense. For you shall not lack anything which may be possessed by you." (45) When
 Moses heard this he betook himself to a second supplication, and said, "I am persuaded by thy
 explanations that I should not have been able to receive the visible appearance of thy form. But I
 beseech thee that I may, at all events, behold the glory that is around thee. And I look upon thy
 glory to be the powers which attend thee as thy guards, the comprehension of which having
 escaped me up to the present time, worketh in me no slight desire of a thorough understanding of
 it." (46) But God replied and said, "The powers which you seek to behold are altogether invisible,
 and appreciable only by the intellect; since I myself am invisible and only appreciable by the
 intellect. And what I call appreciable only by the intellect are not those which are already
 comprehended by the mind, but those which, even if they could be so comprehended, are still such
 that the outward senses could not at all attain to them, but only the very purest intellect. (47) And
 though they are by nature incomprehensible in their essence, still they show a kind of impression
 or copy of their energy and operation; as seals among you, when any wax or similar kind of
 material is applied to them, make an innumerable quantity of figures and impressions, without being
 impaired as to any portion of themselves, but still remaining unaltered and as they were before; so
 also you must conceive that the powers which are around me invest those things which have no
 distinctive qualities with such qualities, and those which have no forms with precise forms, and that
 without having any portion of their own everlasting nature dismembered or weakened. (48) And
 some of your race, speaking with sufficient correctness, call them ideas (ideai), since they give a
 peculiar character (idiopoiousi) to every existing thing, arranging what had previously no order,
 and limiting, and defining, and fashioning what was before destitute of all limitation, and defination,
 and fashion; and, in short, in all respects changing what was bad into a better condition. (49) "Do
 not, then, ever expect to be able to comprehend me nor any one of my powers, in respect of our
 essence. But, as I have said, I willingly and cheerfully grant unto you such things as you may
 receive. And this gift is to call you to the beholding of the world and all the things that are in it, which
 must be comprehended, not indeed by the eyes of the body, but by the sleepless vision of the soul.
 (50) The desire of wisdom alone is continual and incessant, and it fills all its pupils and disciples
 with famous and most beautiful doctrines." When Moses heard this he did not cease from his
 desire, but he still burned with a longing for the understanding of invisible things. [...]{7}{mangey thinks
 that there is a considerable hiatus here. What follows relates to the regulations respecting proselytes, which as the text
 stands is in no way connected with what has gone before about the worship of God.}
<p>
 IX. (51) And he receives all persons of a similar character and disposition, whether they were
 originally born so, or whether they have become so through any change of conduct, having
 become better people, and as such entitled to be ranked in a superior class; approving of the one
 body because they have not defaced their nobility of birth, and of the other because they have
 thought fit to alter their lives so as to come over to nobleness of conduct. And these last he calls
 proselytes (proseµlytous), from the fact of their having come over (proseleµlythenai) to a new and
 Godfearing constitution, learning to disregard the fabulous inventions of other nations, and clinging
 to unalloyed truth. (52) Accordingly, having given equal rank and honour to all those who come
 over, and having granted to them the same favours that were bestowed on the native Jews, he
 recommends those who are ennobled by truth not only to treat them with respect, but even with
 especial friendship and excessive benevolence. And is not this a reasonable recommendation?
 What he says is this. "Those men, who have left their country, and their friends, and their relations
 for the sake of virtue and holiness, ought not to be left destitute of some other cities, and houses,
 and friends, but there ought to be places of refuge always ready for those who come over to
 religion; for the most effectual allurement and the most indissoluble bond of affectionate good will is
 the mutual honouring of the one God." (53) Moreover, he also enjoins his people that, after they
 have given the proselytes an equal share in all their laws, and privileges, and immunities, on their
 forsaking the pride of their fathers and forefathers, they must not give a license to their jealous
 language and unbridled tongues, blaspheming those beings whom the other body looks upon as
 gods, lest the proselytes should be exasperated at such treatment, and in return utter impious
 language against the true and holy God; for from ignorance of the difference between them, and by
 reason of their having from their infancy learnt to look upon what was false as if it had been true,
 and having been bred up with it, they would be likely to err. (54) And there are some of the Gentiles,
 who, not attending to the honour due to the one God alone, deserve to be punished with extreme
 severity of punishment, as having forsaken the most important classification of piety and holiness,
 and as having chosen darkness in preference to the most brilliant light, and having rendered their
 own intellect blind when it might have seen clearly. (55) And it is well that a charge should be given
 to all those who have any admiration for virtue to inflict all such punishment out of hand without any
 delay, not bringing them before either any judgment seat, or any council, or any bench of
 magistrates, but giving vent to their own disposition which hates evil and loves God, so as to
 chastise the impious with implacable rigour, looking upon themselves as everything for the time
 being, counsellors, and judges, and generals, and members of the assembly, and accusers, and
 witnesses, and laws, and the people; that so, since there is no conceivable hindrance, they may
 with all their company put themselves forward fearlessly to fight as the champions of holiness.
<p>
 X. (56) There is, in the history of the law, a record of one man who ventured on this exploit of noble
 daring, for when he saw some men connecting themselves with foreign women, and by reason of
 their allurements neglecting all their national customs and laws, and practising fabulous
 ceremonies, he was seized with a sudden enthusiasm in the presence of the whole multitude; and
 driving away all those on each side who were collected to see the sight, he slew one man who was
 so daring as to put himself forward as the leader and chief of this transgression of the law (for the
 impious deed had been already displayed and made a public exhibition of), and while he was
 openly performing sacrifices to images and unholy idols, he, I say, without being influenced by any
 fear, slew him, together with the woman who was with him; the one on account of his inclination to
 learn those things which it would have been more advantageous for him not to have learnt, and the
 woman because she was his preceptress in evil. (57) This action being done of a sudden, in the
 warm impetuosity of the moment, admonished a vast multitude of those who were prepared to
 commit similar follies; therefore God, having praised this virtuous exploit done in this manner, out
 of a voluntary and spontaneous zeal, recompensed the doer with two rewards, namely, peace and
 the priesthood. With the one, because he judged him who had thus voluntarily encountered a
 contest for the sake of the honour of his God worthy to enjoy a life safe from war; and with the
 other, because the priesthood is the most fitting honour for a pious man, who professes an
 eagerness for the service of the Father of all, to serve whom is not only better than all freedom, but
 even than royal authority. (58) But some men have gone to such a pitch of extravagant madness,
 that they have left themselves no retreat or way to repentance, but hasten onwards to the slavery
 and service of images made by hands, confessing it in distinct characters, not written on paper, as
 is the custom in the case of slaves, but branding the characters deep on their persons with a
 burning iron, in order that they may remain ineffacebly, for these things are not dimmed or
 weakened by time.
<p>
 XI. (59) And the most sacred Moses appears to have preserved the same object and intention in
 all other cases whatever, being a lover and also a teacher of truth, which he desires to stamp and
 to impress upon all his disciples, expelling all false opinions, and compelling them to settle far from
 their minds. (60) At all events, knowing that the act of divination co-operates in no slight degree
 with the errors of the lives of the multitude, so as to lead them out of the right way, he did not suffer
 his disciples to use any species of it whatever, but drove all who paid it any observance far from
 his everlasting constitution, and banished all sacrificers and purifiers, and augurs, and
 soothsayers, and enchanters, and men who applied themselves to the art of prophesying from
 sounds; (61) for all these men are but guessers at what is probable and likely, at different times
 adopting different notions from the same appearances, because the subjects of their art have no
 stable and constant character, and because the intellect has never devised any accurate test by
 which those opinions which are approved may be examined. (62) And all these things are but the
 furniture of impiety. How so? Because he who attends to them, and who allows himself to be
 influenced by them, disregards the cause of all things, looking upon those things alone as the
 causes of all things, whether good or evil; and he does not perceive that he is making all the cares
 of life to depend upon the most unstable supports, upon the motion of birds and feathers in the air,
 in this and that direction; and upon the paths of reptiles, crawling along the ground, which creep
 forth out of their holes in quest of food; and even upon entrails, and blood, and dead corpses,
 which, the moment that they are deprived of life, fall to pieces and become confused; and being
 deprived of their original nature which belonged to them, are changed, and subjected to a
 transformation for the worse. (63) For he thinks it right, that the man who is legally enrolled as a
 citizen of his constitution must be perfect, not indeed in those things in which the multitude is
 educated, such as divination, and augury, and plausible conjectures, but in the observances due to
 God, which have nothing doubtful or uncertain about them, but only indubitable and naked truth.
 (64) And since there is implanted in all men a desire of the knowledge of future events, and as, on
 account of this desire, they have recourse to sacrifices and to other species of divination, as if by
 these means they would be able to search out and discover the truth (but these things are, in
 reality, full of indistinctness and uncertainty, and are continually being convicted by themselves).
 He, with great energy, forbids his disciples to apply themselves to such sources of knowledge; and
 he says, that if they are truly pious they shall not be deprived of a proper knowledge of the future;
 (65) but that some other Prophet{8}{this prophecy, #De 18:18, is always looked upon as one of the most
 remarkable of the early prophecies of our Saviour.} will appear to them on a sudden, inspired like himself,
 who will preach and prophesy among them, saying nothing of his own (for he who is truly
 possessed and inspired, even when he speaks, is unable to comprehend what he is himself
 saying), but that all the words that he should utter would proceed from him as if another was
 prompting him; for the prophets are interpreters of God, who is only using their voices as
 instruments, in order to explain what he chooses. Having now then said this, and other things like
 this, concerning the proper idea to be entertained of the one real, and true, and living God; he
 proceeds to express in what manner one ought to pay him the honours that are his Due.{9}{yonge's
 translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: On the Monarchy, Book II. Accordingly, his next paragraph
 begins with roman numeral I (= XII in the Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes with number XV (= XXVI in the Loeb). The
 publisher has elected to follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 XII. (66) We ought to look upon the universal world as the highest and truest temple of God, having
 for its most holy place that most sacred part of the essence of all existing things, namely, the
 heaven; and for ornaments, the stars; and for priests, the subordinate ministers of his power,
 namely, the angels, incorporeal souls, not beings compounded of irrational and rational natures,
 such as our bodies are, but such as have the irrational parts wholly cut out, being absolutely and
 wholly intellectual, pure reasonings, resembling the unit. (67) But the other temple is made with
 hands; for it was desirable not to cut short the impulses of men who were eager to bring in
 contributions for the objects of piety, and desirous either to show their gratitude by sacrifices for
 such good fortune as had befallen them, or else to implore pardon and forgiveness for whatever
 errors they might have committed. He moreover foresaw that there could not be any great number
 of temples built either in many different places, or in the same place, thinking it fitting that as God is
 one, his temple also should be one. (68) In the next place, he does not permit those who desire to
 perform sacrifices in their own houses to do so, but he orders all men to rise up, even from the
 furthest boundaries of the earth, and to come to this temple, by which command he is at the same
 time testing their dispositions most severely; for he who was not about to offer sacrifice in a pure
 and holy spirit would never endure to quit his country, and his friends, and relations, and emigrate
 into a distant land, but would be likely, being under the influence of a more powerful attraction than
 that towards piety, to continue attached to the society of his most intimate friends and relations as
 portions of himself, to which he was most closely attached. (69) And the most evident proof of this
 may be found in the events which actually took place. For innumerable companies of men from a
 countless variety of cities, some by land and some by sea, from east and from west, from the north
 and from the south, came to the temple at every festival, as if to some common refuge and safe
 asylum from the troubles of this most busy and painful life, seeking to find tranquillity, and to
 procure a remission of and respite from those cares by which from their earliest infancy they had
 been hampered and weighed down, (70) and so, by getting breath as it were, to pass a brief time in
 cheerful festivities, being filled with good hopes and enjoying the leisure of that most important and
 necessary vacation which consists in forming a friendship with those hitherto unknown, but now
 initiated by boldness and a desire to honour God, and forming a combination of actions and a
 union of dispositions so as to join in sacrifices and libations to the most complete confirmation of
 mutual good will.
<p>
 XIII. (71) Of this temple the outer circuit, being the most extensive both in length and width, was
 fortified by fortifications adorned in a most costly manner. And each of them is a double portico,
 built and adorned with the finest materials of wood and stone, and with abundant supplies of all
 kinds, and with the greatest skill of the workmen, and the most diligent care on the part of the
 superintendants. But the inner circuits were less extensive, and the fashion of their building and
 adorning was more simple. (72) And in the centre was the temple itself, beautiful beyond all
 possible description, as one may conjecture from what is now seen around on the outside; for what
 is innermost is invisible to every human creature except the high priest alone, and even he is
 enjoined only to enter that holy place once in each year. Everything then is invisible. For he carries
 in a brasier full of coals and frankincense; and then, when a great smoke proceeds from it, as is
 natural, and when everything all around is enveloped in it, then the sight of men is clouded, and
 checked, and prevented from penetrating in, being wholly unable to pierce the cloud. (73) But,
 being very large and very lofty, although built in a very low situation, it is not inferior to any of the
 greatest mountains around. The buildings of it are of most exceeding beauty and magnificence, so
 as to be universal objects of admiration to all who behold them, and especially to all foreigners who
 travel to those parts, and who, comparing them with their own public edifices, marvel both at the
 beauty and sumptuousness of this one. (74) But there is no grove of plantation in the space which
 surrounds it, in accordance with the prohibitions of the law, which for many reasons forbid this. In
 the first place, because a building which is truly a temple does not aim at pleasure and seductive
 allurements, but at a rigid and austere sanctity. Secondly, because it is not proper that those things
 which conduce to the verdure of trees should be introduced, such as the dung of irrational animals
 and of men. Thirdly, because those trees which do not admit of cultivation are of no use, but are as
 the poets say, the burden of the earth; while those which do admit of cultivation, and which are
 productive of wholesome fruit, draw off the attention of the fickle-minded from the thoughts of the
 respect due to the holy place itself, and to the ceremonies in which they are engaged. (75) And
 besides these reasons, shady places and dense thickets are places of refuge for evil doers, since
 by their enveloping them in darkness they give them safety and enable them, as from an
 ambuscade, suddenly to fall upon any whom they choose to attack. But wide spaces, open and
 uncovered in every direction, where there is nothing which can hinder the sight, are the most
 suitable for the distinct sight of all those who enter and remain in the temple.
<p>
 XIV. (76) But the temple has for its revenues not only portions of land, but also other possessions
 of much greater extent and importance, which will never be destroyed or diminished; for as long as
 the race of mankind shall last, the revenues likewise of the temple will always be preserved, being
 coeval in their duration with the universal world. (77) For it is commanded that all men shall every
 year bring their first fruits to the temple, from twenty years old and upwards; and this contribution is
 called their ransom. On which account they bring in the first fruits with exceeding cheerfulness,
 being joyful and delighted, inasmuch as simultaneously with their making the offering they are sure
 to find either a relaxation from slavery, or a relief from disease, and to receive in all respects a
 most sure freedom and safety for the future. (78) And since the nation is the most numerous of all
 peoples, it follows naturally that the first fruits contributed by them must also be most abundant.
 Accordingly there is in almost every city a storehouse for the sacred things to which it is customary
 for the people to come and there to deposit their first fruits, and at certain seasons there are
 sacred ambassadors selected on account of their virtue, who convey the offerings to the temple.
 And the most eminent men of each tribe are elected to this office, that they may conduct the hopes
 of each individual safe to their destination; for in the lawful offering of the first fruits are the hopes
 of the pious.
<p>
 XV. (79) Now there are twelve tribes of the nation, and one of them having been selected from the
 others for its excellence has received the priesthood, receiving this honour as a reward for its
 virtue, and fidelity, and its devout soul, which it displayed when the multitude appeared to be running
 into sin, following the foolish choices of some persons who persuaded their countrymen to imitate
 the vanity of the Egyptians, and the pride of the nations of the land, who had invented fables about
 irrational animals, and especially about bulls, making gods of them. For this tribe did of its own
 accord go forth and slay all the leaders of this apostacy from the youth upwards, in which they
 appeared to have done a holy action, encountering thus a contest and a labour for the sake of
 piety.
<p>
 XVI. (80) Now these are the laws which relate to the priests. It is enjoined that the priest shall be
 entire and unmutilated, having no blemish on his body, no part being deficient, either naturally or
 through mutilation; and on the other hand, nothing having been superfluous either from his birth or
 having grown out subsequently from disease; his skin, also, must never have changed from
 leprosy, or wild lichen, or scab, or any other eruption or breaking out; all which things appear to me
 to be designed to be symbols of the purity of his soul. (81) For if it was necessary to examine the
 mortal body of the priest that it ought not be imperfect through any misfortune, much more was it
 necessary to look into his immortal soul, which they say is fashioned in the form of the living God.
 Now the image of God is the Word, by which all the world was made. (82) And after enjoining that
 the priest is to be of pure blood, and sprung from fathers of noble birth, and that he must be perfect
 in body and soul, laws are enacted also respecting the garments which the priest must wear when
 he is about to offer the sacred sacrifices and to perform the sacred ceremonies. (83) And this
 dress is a linen tunic and a girdle, the latter to cover those parts which must not be displayed in
 their nakedness near the altar of sacrifice. And the tunic is for the sake of promptness in
 performing the requisite ministrations; for they are but lightly clad, only in their tunics, when they
 bring their victims, and the libations, and the other requisite offerings for sacrifice, being apparelled
 so as to admit of unhesitating celerity. (84) But the high priest is commanded to wear a similar
 dress when he goes into the holy of holies to offer incense, because linen is not made of any
 animal that dies, as woollen garments are. He is also commanded to wear another robe also,
 having very beautiful embroidery and ornament upon it, so that it may seem to be a copy and
 representation of the world. And the description of the ornament is a clear proof of this; (85) for in
 the first place the whole of the round robe is of hyacinthine colour, a tunic reaching to the feet,
 being an emblem of the air, since the air also is by nature black, and in a manner may be said to be
 reaching to the feet, as it is extended from above from the regions about the moon, to the lowest
 places of the earth. (86) Next there was a woven garment in the form of a breastplate upon it, and
 this was a symbol of the heaven; for on the points of the shoulders are two emerald stones of most
 exceeding value, one on one side and one on the other, each perfectly round and single on each
 side, as emblems of the hemispheres, one of which is above the earth and the other under the
 earth. (87) Then on his chest there are twelve precious stones of different colours, arranged in
 four rows of three stones in each row, being fashioned so as an emblem of the zodiac. For the
 zodiac also consists of twelve animals, and so divides the four seasons of the year, allotting three
 animals to each season. (88) And the whole place is very correctly called the logeum (logeion),
 since every thing in heaven has been created and arranged in accordance with right reason
 (logois) and proportion; for there is absolutely nothing there which is devoid of reason. And on the
 logeum he embroiders two woven pieces of cloth, calling the one manifestation and the other truth.
 (89) And by the one which he calls truth he expresses figuratively that it is absolutely impossible for
 falsehood to enter any part of heaven, but that it is entirely banished to the parts around the earth,
 dwelling among the souls of impious men. And by that which he calls manifestation he implies that
 the natures in heaven make manifest every thing that takes place among us, which of themselves
 would be perfectly and universally unknown. (90) And the clearest proof of this is that if there were
 no light, and if the sun did not shine, it would be impossible for the indescribable variety of qualities
 of bodies to be seen, and for all the manifold differences of colours and forms to be distinguished
 from one another. And what else could exhibit to us the days and the nights, and the months and
 the years, and in short the divisions of time, but the harmonious and inconceivable revolutions of
 the sun, and moon, and other stars? (91) And what could exhibit the true nature of number, except
 those same bodies just mentioned in accordance with the observation of the combination of the
 parts of time? And what else could have cut the paths through the ocean and through such
 numerous and vast seas, and shown them to navigators, except the changes and periodical
 appearances of the stars? And wise men have observed, (92) also, an innumerable quantity of
 other circumstances, and have recorded them, conjecturing from the heavenly bodies the advent
 of calm weather and of violent storms, and the fertility or barrenness of crops, and the mild or
 violently hot summers, and whether the winters will be severe or spring-like, whether there will be
 droughts or abundance of rain, whether the flocks and trees will be fruitful, or on the contrary
 barren, and all such matters as these. For the signs of every thing on earth are engraved and
 firmly fixed in heaven.
<p>
 XVII. (93) And besides this, golden pomegranates are attached to the lower parts of the tunic,
 reaching to the feet, and bells and borders embroidered with flowers. And these things are the
 emblems of earth and of water; the flowers are the emblems of the earth, inasmuch as it is out of it
 that they all rise and derive strength to bloom. And the Pomegranates{10}{the Greek for a pomegranate is
 rhoia, or rhoiskos, which Philo imagines to be derived from rheoµ, "to flow."} as above mentioned are the
 emblems of water, being so named from the flowing of the stream. And the harmony, and concord,
 and unison of sound of the different parts of the world is betokened by the bells. (94) And the
 arrangement is a very excellent one; for the upper garment, on which the stones are placed, which
 is called the breast-plate, is a representation of heaven, because the heaven also is the highest of
 all things. And the tunic that reaches to the feet is in every part of a hyacinthine colour, since the
 air also is black, and is placed in the second classification next in honour to the heaven. And the
 embroidered flowers and pomegranates are on the hem, because the earth and water have been
 assigned the lowest situation in the universe. (95) This is the arrangement of the sacred dress of
 the high priest, being a representation of the universe, a marvellous work to be beheld or to be
 contemplated. For it has an appearance thoroughly calculated to excite astonishment, such as no
 embroidered work conceived by man ever was for variety and costly magnificence; (96) and it also
 attracts the intellect of philosophers to examine its different parts. For God intends that the high
 priest should in the first place have a visible representation of the universe about him, in order that
 from the continual sight of it he may be reminded to make his own life worthy of the nature of the
 universe, and secondly, in order that the whole world may co-operate with him in the performance
 of his sacred rites. And it is exceedingly becoming that the man who is consecrated to the service
 of the Father of the world should also bring his son to the service of him who has begotten him.
 (97) There is also a third symbol contained in this sacred dress, which it is important not to pass
 over in silence. For the priests of other deities are accustomed to offer up prayers and sacrifices
 solely for their own relations, and friends, and fellow citizens. But the high priest of the Jews offers
 them up not only on behalf of the whole race of mankind, but also on behalf of the different parts of
 nature, of the earth, of water, of air, and of fire; and pours forth his prayers and thanksgivings for
 them all, looking upon the world (as indeed it really is) as his country, for which, therefore, he is
 accustomed to implore and propitiate its governor by supplications and prayers, beseeching him to
 give a portion of his own merciful and humane nature to the things which he has created.
<p>
 XVIII. (98) After he has given these precepts, he issues additional commandments, and orders
 him, whenever he approaches the altar and touches the sacrifices, at the time when it is appointed
 for him to perform his sacred ministrations, not to drink wine or any other strong drink, on account
 of four most important reasons, hesitation, and forgetfulness, and sleep, and folly. (99) For the
 intemperate man relaxes the powers of his body, and renders his limbs more slow of motion, and
 makes his whole body more inclined to hesitation, and compels it by force to become drowsy. And
 he also relaxes the energies of his soul, and so becomes the cause to it of forgetfulness and folly.
 But in the case of abstemious men all the parts of the body are lighter, and as such more active
 and moveable, and the outer senses are more pure and unalloyed, and the mind is gifted with a
 more acute sight, so that it is able to see things beforehand, and never forgets what it has
 previously seen; (100) in short, therefore, we must look upon the use of wine to be a most
 unprofitable thing for all the purposes of life, inasmuch as by it the soul is weighed down, the
 outward senses are dimmed, and the body is enervated. For it does not leave any one of our
 faculties free and unembarrassed, but is a hindrance to every one of them, so as to impede its
 attaining that object to which it is by nature fitted. But in sacred ceremonies and holy rites the
 mischief is most grievous of all, in proportion as it is worse and more intolerable to sin with respect
 to God than with respect to man. On which account it probably is that it is commanded to the priest
 to offer up sacrifices without wine, in order to make a difference and distinction between sacred
 and profane things, and pure and impure things, and lawful and unlawful things.
<p>
 XIX. (101) But since the priest was a man before he was a priest, and since he is of necessity
 desirous to indulge the appetites which prompt him to seek for the connections of love, he
 procures for him a marriage with a pure virgin, and one who is born of pure parents, and
 grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, selected for their excellency with reference both to their
 virtue and to their noble birth. (102) For God does not allow him even to look upon a harlot, or a
 profane body or soul, or upon any one who, having put away her pursuit of gain, now wears an
 elegant and modest appearance, because such a one is unholy in respect of her former
 profession and way of life; though in other respects she may be looked upon as honourable, by
 reason of her having purified herself of her former evil courses. For repentance for past sins is a
 thing to be praised; and no one else need be forbidden to marry her, only let her not come near a
 priest. For the especial property of the priesthood is justice and purity, which from the first
 beginning of its creation to the end, seeks a concord utterly irreproachable. (103) For it would be
 mere folly that some men should be excluded from the priesthood by reason of the scars which
 exist on their bodies from ancient wounds, which are the emblem of misfortune indeed, but not of
 wickedness; but that those persons who, not at all out of necessity but from their own deliberate
 choice, have made a market of their beauty, when at last they slowly repent, should at once after
 leaving their lovers become united to priests, and should come from brothels and be admitted into
 the sacred precincts. For the scars and impressions of their old offences remain not the less in
 the souls of those who repent. (104) On which account it is wisely and truly said in another
 passage, that "One may not bring the hire of a harlot into the Temple."{11}{#de 23:18.} And yet
 the money is not in itself liable to any reproach, except by reason of the woman who received it,
 and the action for which it was given to her. How then could one possibly admit those women to
 consort with priests whose very money is looked upon as profane and base, even though as to its
 material and stamp it may be good and lawful money?
<p>
 XX. (105) The regulations, therefore, are laid down with precision in this manner for the high priest,
 so that he is not allowed either to marry a widow, nor one who is left desolate after the death of the
 man to whom she has been espoused, nor one who has been divorced from a husband who is still
 alive, in order that the sacred seed may be sown for the first time in a field which is hitherto
 untrodden and pure, and that his offspring may have no admixture of the blood of any other house.
 And in the second place, in order that the pair coming together with souls which have as yet known
 no defilement or perversion, may easily form their dispositions and characters in a virtuous
 manner. For the minds of virgins are easily attracted and drawn over to virtue, being exceedingly
 ready to be taught. (106) But the woman who has had experience of another husband is very
 naturally less inclined to obedience and to instruction, inasmuch as she has not a soul perfectly
 pure, like thoroughly smooth wax, so as to receive distinctly the doctrines which are to be
 impressed upon it, but one which is to a certain degree rough from the impressions which have
 been already stamped upon it, which are difficult to be effaced, and so remain, and do not easily
 receive any other impression, or if they do they render it confused by the irregularity of their own
 surface. (107) Let the high priest, therefore, take a pure virgin to be his wife; I say a virgin,
 meaning not only one with whom no other man has even been connected, but one in connection
 with whom no other man has ever been named in reference to the agreement of marriage, even
 though her body may be pure.
<p>
 XXI. (108) But besides this, injunctions are given to the particular and inferior priests concerning
 their marriages, which are the very same in most points, which are given to those who have the
 supreme priesthood. But they are permitted with impunity to marry not only maidens but widows
 also; not, indeed, all widows, but those whose husbands are dead. For the law thinks it fitting to
 remove all quarrels and disputes from the life of the priests. And if they had husbands living there
 very likely might be disputes from the jealousy which is caused by the love of men for women. But
 when the first husband is dead, then with him the hostility which could be felt towards the second
 husband dies also. (109) And even on other accounts he might have thought that the high priest
 ought to be of superior purity and holiness, as in other matters so also in the connection of
 marriage, and on this account it may have been that God only allowed the high priest to marry a
 virgin. But to the priests of the second rank he remitted something of the rigour of his regulations
 concerning the connection with women, permitting them to marry women who have made trials of
 other husbands.
<p>
 XXII. (110) And besides these commands, he also defined precisely the family of the women who
 might be married by the high priest, commanding him to marry not merely a woman who was a
 virgin, but also one who was a priestess, the daughter of a priest, that so both bridegroom and
 bride might be of one house, and in a manner of one blood, so as to display a most lasting
 harmony and union of disposition during the whole of their lives. (111) The others also were
 permitted to marry women who were not the daughters of priests, partly because their purificatory
 sacrifices are of but small importance, and partly because he was not willing entirely to disunite and
 separate the whole nation from the order of the priesthood; for which reason he did not prevent the
 other priests from making intermarriages with any of their countrywomen, as that is relationship in
 the second degree; for sons-in-law are in the place of sons to their fathersin-law, and
 fathers-in-law instead of fathers to their sons-in-law.
<p>
 XXIII. (112) These, then, are the ordinances which were established respecting marriage, and
 respecting what greatly resembles marriage, the procreation of children. But since destruction
 follows creation, Moses also gave the priests laws relating to death, {12}{#le 23:1.} commanding
 them not to permit themselves to be defiled in respect of all people whatsoever, who might happen
 to die, and who might be connected with them through some bond of friendship, or distant
 relationship: but allowing them to mourn for six classes only, their fathers or their mothers, their
 sons of their daughters, their brothers or their sisters, provided that these last were virgins; (113)
 but the high priest he absolutely forbade to mourn in any case whatever; and may we not say that
 this was rightly done? For as to the ministrations which belong to the other priests, one individual
 can perform them instead of another, so that, even if some be in mourning, still none of the usual
 observances need be omitted; but there is no one besides the high priest himself, who is permitted
 to perform his duties instead of him; for which reason, he must always be kept free from all
 defilement, never touching any dead body, in order that, being always ready to offer up prayers and
 sacrifices on behalf of the whole world at suitable seasons, he may continue to fulfil the duties of
 his office without hindrance. (114) And otherwise too, besides this consideration, the man who has
 been assigned to God, and who has become the leader of his sacred band of worshippers, ought
 to be disconnected with, and alienated from, all things of creation, not being so much the slave of
 the love of either parents, or children, or brothers, as either to omit or to delay any one of those
 holy actions, which it is by all means better should be done at once; (115) and God commands the
 high priest neither to rend his clothes over his very nearest relations when they die, nor to take
 from his head the ensign of the priesthood, nor in short to depart from the holy place on any plea of
 mourning, that, showing proper respect to the place, and to the sacred ornaments with which he
 himself is crowned, he may show himself superior to pity, and pass the whole of his life exempt
 from all sorrow. (116) For the law designs that he should be the partaker of a nature superior to
 that of man; inasmuch as he approaches more nearly to that of the Deity; being, if one must say
 the plain truth, on the borders between the two, in order that men may propitiate God by some
 mediator, and that God may have some subordinate minister by whom he may offer and give his
 mercies and kindnesses to mankind.
<p>
 XXIV. (117) After he has said this, he immediately proceeds to lay down laws, concerning those
 who are to use the first fruits, "If therefore, any One,"{13}{#le 21:17.} says he, "should mutilate the
 priests as to their eyes, or their feet, or any part of their bodies, or if he should have received any
 blemish, let him not partake of the sacred ministrations by reason of the defects which exist in him,
 but still let him enjoy those honours which are common to all the priests, because of his
 irreproachable nobility of birth." (118) "Moreover, if any leprosies break out and attack him or if any
 one of the priests he afflicted with any flux, let him not touch the sacred table, nor any of the duties
 which are set apart for his race, until the flux stop, or the leprosy change, so that he become again
 resembling the complexion of sound Flesh."{14}{#le 22:4.} (119) And, if any priest do by any
 chance whatever touch anything that is unclean, or if he should have impure dreams by night, as is
 very often apt to be the case, let him during all that day touch nothing that has been consecrated,
 but let him wash himself and the ensuing evening, and after that let him not be hindered from
 touching them. (120) And let the sojourner in the priest's house, and the hireling, be prevented from
 approaching the first fruits; the sojourner, because it is not every one who is a neighbour who
 shares a man's hearth and eats at his table; {15}{#le 22:10.} for there is reason to fear that some
 such person may cast away what is hallowed, using as a cloak for his impiety the pretence of
 some unseasonable humanity; for one might not give all men a share of all things, but only of such
 as are adapted to those who are to receive them; otherwise, that which is the most beautiful and
 most beneficial of all the things in this life, namely order, will be wasted away and destroyed by that
 which is the most mischievous of all things, namely, confusion. (121) For if in merchant vessels the
 sailors were to receive an equal share with the pilot of the ship, and if in ships of war the rowers
 and the mariners were to receive an equal share with the captain, and if in military camps the
 cavalry of the line were to receive an equal share with their officers, the heavy armed infantry with
 their colonels, and the colonels with the generals; again, if in cities the parties before the court
 were to be placed on the same footing with the judges, the committeemen with the ministers, and in
 short private individuals with the magistrates, there would be incessant troubles and seditions, and
 the equality in words would produce inequality in fact; for it is an unequal measure to give equal
 honour to persons who are unequal in rank or desert; and inequality is the root of all evil. (122) On
 which account one must not give the honours of the priests to sojourners, just as one must not give
 them to any one else, who in that case, because of their proximity, would be meddling with what
 they have no business; for the honour does not belong to the house, but to the race.
<p>
 XXV. (123) In like manner, no one must give this sacred honour to a hireling, as his wages, or as a
 recompense for his service; for sometimes he who receives it being unholy will employ it for
 illegitimate purposes, making the honours due to purity of birth common, and profaning all the
 sacred ceremonies and observances relating to the temple; (124) on which account the law
 altogether forbids any foreigner to partake in any degree of the holy things, even if he be a man of
 the noblest birth among the natives of the land, and irreproachable as respects both men and
 women, in order that the sacred honours may not be adulterated, but may remain carefully guarded
 in the family of the priests; (125) for it would be absurd that the sacrifices and holy ordinances, and
 all the other sacred observances pertaining to the altar, should be entrusted not to all men but to
 the priests alone; but that the rewards for the performance of those things should be common and
 liable to fall to the share of any chance persons, as if it were reasonable that the priests should be
 worn out with labours and toils, and nightly and daily cares, but that the rewards for such pains
 should be common and open to those who do nothing. (126) But, he proceeds, let the priest who is
 his master give to the slave who is born in his house, and to him who has been purchased with
 money, a share of meat and drink from the first fruits. In the first place, because the master is the
 only source of supply to the servant, and the inheritance of the master are the sacred offices of
 humanity, by which the slave must necessarily be supported. (127) In the second place, because it
 is by all means necessary that they should not do what is to be done unwillingly; and servants, even
 though we may not like it, since they are always about us and living with us, preparing meat, and
 drink, and delicacies for their masters beforehand, and standing at their tables, and carrying away
 the fragments that are left, even though they may not take any openly, will at all events secretly
 appropriate some of the victuals, being compelled by necessity to steal, so that instead of one
 injury (if indeed it is an injury to their masters that they should be supported at their expense), they
 are compelled to add a second to it, namely, theft; in order that, like thieves, they may enjoy what
 has been consecrated by their masters who live irreproachably themselves; which is the most
 unreasonable thing possible. (128) Thirdly, one ought to take this also into consideration, that
 share of the first fruits will not be neglected merely because they are distributed to the servants,
 through their fear of their masters; for this is sufficient to stop their mouths, preventing the
 arrogance of such persons from showing itself.
<p>
 XXVI. (129) Having said thus much he proceeds next to put forth a law full of humanity. If, says he,
 the daughter of a priest, having married a man who is not a priest, becomes a widow by the death
 of her husband, or if she be left childless while he is still alive, let her return again to her father's
 house, to receive her share of the first fruits which she enjoyed when she was a virgin; {16}{leviticus
 22:12.} for in some degree and in effect she is now also a virgin, since she has neither husband nor
 children, and has no other refuge but her father; (130) but if she has sons or daughters, then the
 mother must of necessity be classed with the children; and the sons and daughters, being ranked
 as of the family of their father, draw their mother also with them into his House.{17}{yonge's translation
 includes a separate treatise title at this point: On the Question: What the Rewards and Honours Are Which Belong to the
 Priests. Accordingly, his next paragraph begins with roman numeral I (= XVII in the Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes
 with number VI (= XXXII in the Loeb). The publisher has elected to follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 XXVII. (131) The law did not allot any share of the land to the priests, in order that they like others
 might derive revenues from the land, and so possess a sufficiency of necessary things; but
 admitting them to an excessive degree of honour, he said that God was their inheritance, having a
 reference to the things offered to God; for the sake of two objects, both that of doing them the
 highest honour, since they are thus made partners in those things which are offered up by pious
 men, out of gratitude to God; and also in order that they might have no business about which to
 trouble themselves except the offices of religion, as they would have had, if they were forced to
 take care of their inheritance. And the following are the rewards and preeminent honours which he
 assigns to them; (132) in the first place, that the necessary food for their support shall at all times
 be provided for them without any labour or toil of their own; for God commands those who are
 making bread, to take of all the fat and of all the dough, a loaf as first fruits for the use of the
 priests, making thus, by this legitimate instruction, a provision for those men who put aside these
 first fruits, proceeding in the way that leads to piety; (133) for being accustomed at all times to
 offer first fruits of the necessary food, they will thus have an everlasting recollection of God, than
 which it is impossible to imagine a greater blessing; and it follows of necessity, that the first fruits
 offered by the most populous of nations must be very plentiful, so that even the very poorest of the
 priests, must, in respect of his abundance of all necessary food, appear to be very wealthy. (134)
 In the second place, he commands the nation also to give them the first fruits of their other
 possessions; a portion of wine out of each winepress; and of wheat and barley from each
 threshing floor. And in like manner they were to have a share of oil from all; the olive trees, and of
 eatable fruit from all the fruit trees, in order that they might not pass a squalid existence, having
 only barely enough of necessary food to support life, but that they might have sufficient for a
 certain degree of comfort and luxury, and so live cheerfully on abundant means, with all becoming
 ornament and refinement. (135) The third honour allotted to them is an assignment of all the
 first-born males, of all kinds of land animals which are born for the service and use of mankind; for
 these are the things which God commands to be given to the men consecrated to the priesthood;
 the offspring of oxen, and sheep, and goats, namely calves, and lambs, and kids, inasmuch as they
 both are and are considered clean, both for the purposes of eating and of sacrifice, but he orders
 that money shall be given as a ransom for the young of other animals, such as horses, and asses
 and camels, and similar beasts, without disparaging their real value; (136) and the supplies thus
 afforded them are very great; for the people of this nation breed sheep, and cattle, and flocks of all
 kinds above all other peoples, separating them with great care into flocks of goats, and herds of
 oxen, and flocks of sheep, and a vast quantity of other troops of animals of all kinds. (137)
 Moreover the law, going beyond all these enactments in their favour, commands the people to
 bring them the first fruits, not only of all their possessions of every description, but also of their own
 lives and bodies; for the children are separable portions of their parents as one may say; but if one
 must tell the plain truth, they are inseparable as being of kindred blood, [...]{18}{the above passage is
 quite unintelligible in the Greek, and is given up by Mangey as irremediably corrupt.} and being bound to them by
 the allurements of united good will, and by the indissoluble bonds of nature. (138) But nevertheless,
 he consecrates also their own first-born male children after the fashion of other first fruits, as a
 sort of thanks-offering for fertility, and a number of children both existing and hoped for, and
 wishing at the same time that their marriages should be not only free from all blame, but even very
 deserving of praise, the first fruit arising from which is consecrated to God; and keeping this in
 their minds, both husbands and wives ought to cling to modesty, and to attend to their household
 concerns, and to cherish unanimity, agreeing with one another, so that what is called a communion
 and partnership may be so in solid truth, not only in word, but likewise in deed. (139) And with
 reference to the dedication of the first-born male children, in order that the parents may not be
 separated from their children, nor the children from their parents, he values the first fruits of them
 himself at a fixed price in money ordering everyone both poor and rich to contribute an equal sum,
 not having any reference to the ability of the contributors, nor to the vigour or beauty of the children
 who were born; but considering how much even a very poor man might be able to give; (140) for
 since the birth of children happens equally to the most noble and to the most obscure persons of
 the race, he thought it just to enact that their contribution should also be equal, aiming, as I have
 already said, particularly to fix a sum which should be in the power of everyone to give.
<p>
 XXVIII. (141) After this he also appointed another source of revenue of no insignificant importance
 for the priests, bidding them to take the first fruits of every one of the revenues of the nation
 namely, the first fruits of the corn, and wine, and oil, and even of the produce of all the cattle, of the
 flocks of sheep, and herds of oxen, and flocks of goats, and of all other animals of all kinds; and
 how great an abundance of these animals there must be, any one may conjecture from the vast
 populousness of the nation; (142) from all which circumstances it is plain that the law invests the
 priests with the dignity and honour that belongs to kings; since he commands contributions from
 every description of possession to be given to them as to rulers; (143) and they are accordingly
 given to them in a manner quite contrary to that in which cities usually furnish them to their rulers;
 for cities usually furnish them under compulsion, and with great unwillingness and lamentation,
 looking upon the collectors of the taxes as common enemies and destroyers, and making all kinds
 of different excuses at different times, and neglecting all laws and ordinances, and with all this
 jumbling and evasion do they contribute the taxes and payments which are levied on them. (144)
 But the men of this nation contribute their payments to the priests with joy and cheerfulness,
 anticipating the collectors, and cutting short the time allowed for making the contributions, and
 thinking that they are themselves receiving rather than giving; and so with words of blessing and
 thankfulness, they all, both men and women, bring their offerings at each of the seasons of the
 year, with a spontaneous cheerfulness, and readiness, and zeal, beyond all description.
<p>
 XXIX. (145) And these things are assigned to the priests from the possessions of each individual,
 but there are also often especial revenues set apart for them exceedingly suitable for the priests,
 which are derived from the sacrifices which are offered up; for it is commanded that two portions
 from two limbs of every victim shall be given to the priests, the arm from the limb on the right side,
 and the fat from the chest; for the one is a symbol of strength and manly vigour, and of every lawful
 action in giving, and taking, and acting: and the other is an emblem of human gentleness as far as
 the angry passions are concerned; (146) for it is said that these passions have their abode in the
 chest, since nature has assigned them the breast for their home as the most suitable place;
 around which as around a garrison she has thrown, in order more effectually to secure them from
 being taken, a very strong fence which is called the chest, which she has made of many
 continuous and very strong bones, binding it firmly with nerves which cannot be broken. (147) But
 from the victims which are sacrificed away from the altar, in order to be eaten, it is commanded
 that three portions should be given to the priest, an arm, and a jaw-bone, and that which is called
 the paunch; the arm for the reason which has been mentioned a short time ago; the jaw-bone as a
 first fruit of that most important of all the members of the body, namely the head, and also of
 uttered speech, for the stream of speech could not flow out without the motion of these jaws; for
 they being Agitated{19}{the Greek word here used is seioµ, and the word used for jawbone is siagoµn, which Philo
 appears to think may be derived from seioµ.} (and it is very likely from this, that they have derived their
 name), when they are struck by the tongue, all the organisation of the voice sounds simultaneously;
 (148) and the paunch is a kind of excrescence of the belly. And the belly is a kind of stable of that
 irrational animal the appetite, which, being irrigated by much wine-bibbing and gluttony, is
 continually washed with incessant provision of meat and drink, and like a swine is delighted while
 wallowing in the mire; in reference to which fact, a very suitable place indeed has been assigned to
 that intemperate and most unseemly beast, namely, the place to which all the superfluities are
 conveyed. (149) And the opposite to desire is temperance, which one must endeavour, and labour,
 and take pains by every contrivance imaginable to acquire, as the very greatest blessing and most
 perfect benefit both to an individual and to the state. (150) Appetite therefore, being a profane, and
 impure, and unholy thing, is driven beyond the territories of virtue, and is banished as it ought to be;
 but temperance, being a pure and unblemished virtue, neglecting everything which relates to eating
 and drinking, and boasting itself as superior to the pleasures of the belly, may be allowed to
 approach the sacred altars, bringing forward as it does the excrescence of the body, as a
 memorial that it may be reminded to despise all insatiability and gluttony, and all those things which
 excite the appetites to this pitch.
<p>
 XXX. (151) And beyond all these things he also orders that the priests who minister the offering of
 the sacrifices, shall receive the skins of the whole burnt offerings (and they amount to an
 unspeakable number, this being no slight gift, but one of the most exceeding value and
 importance), from which circumstances it is plain, that although he has not given to the priesthood
 a portion of land as its inheritance, in the same manner that he has to others, he has yet assigned
 to them a more honourable and more untroubled share than any other tribe, granting them the first
 fruits of every description of sacrifice and offering. (152) And to prevent anyone of those who give
 the offerings, from reproaching those who receive them, he commands that the first fruits should
 first of all be carried into the temple, and then orders that the priests shall take them out of the
 temple; for it was suitable to the nature of God, that those who had received kindness in all the
 circumstances of life, should bring the first fruits as thank-offering, and then that he, as a being
 who was in want of nothing, should with all dignity and honour bestow them on the servants and
 ministers who attend on the service of the temple; for to appear to receive these things not from
 men, but from the great Benefactor of all men, appears to be receiving a gift which has in it no alloy
 of sadness.
<p>
 XXXI. (153) Since, then, these honours are put forth for them, if any of the priests are in any
 difficulty while living virtuously and irreproachably, they are at once accusers of us as disregarding
 the law, even though they may not utter a word. For if we were to obey the commands which we
 have received, and if we were to take care to give the first fruits as we are commanded, they would
 not only have abundance of all necessary things, but would also be filled with all kinds of supplies
 calculated for enabling them to live in refinement and luxury. (154) And if ever at any subsequent
 time the tribe of the priests is found to be blessed with a great abundance of all the necessaries
 and luxuries of life, this will be a great proof of their common holiness, and of their accurate
 observance of the laws and ordinances in every particular. But the neglect of some persons (for it
 is not safe to blame every one) is the cause of poverty to those who have been dedicated to God,
 and, if one must tell the truth, to the men themselves also. (155) For to violate the law is injurious to
 those who offend, even though it may be an attractive course for a short time; but to obey the
 ordinances of nature is most beneficial, even if at the time it may wear a painful appearance and
 may show no pleasant character.
<p>
 XXXII. (156) Having given all these supplies and revenues to the priests, he did not neglect those
 either who were in the second rank of the priesthood; and these are the keepers of the temple, of
 whom some are placed at the doors, at the very entrance of the temple, as door-keepers; and
 others are within, in the vestibule of the temple, in order that no one who ought not to do so might
 enter it, either deliberately or by accident. Others, again, stand all around, having had the times of
 their watches assigned to them by lot, so as to watch by turns night and day, some being day
 watchmen and others night watchmen. Others, again, had charge of the porticoes and of the
 courts in the open air, and carried out all the rubbish, taking care of the cleanliness of the temple,
 and the tenths were assigned as the wages of all these men; for these tenths are the share of the
 keepers of the temple. (157) At all events the law did not permit those who received them to make
 use of them, until they had again offered up as first fruits other tenths as if from their own private
 property, and before they had given these to the priests of the superior rank, for then it permitted
 them to enjoy them, but before that time it would not allow it. (158) Moreover, the law allotted to
 them fortyeight cities, and in every city, suburbs, extending two hundred cubits all round, for the
 pasture of their cattle, and for the other necessary purposes of which cities have need. But of
 these cities, six were set apart, some on the near side, and some on the further side of Jordan,
 three on each side, as cities of refuge for those who had committed unintentional murder. (159)
 For as it was not consistent with holiness for one who had by any means whatever become the
 cause of death to any human being to come within the sacred precincts, using the temple as a
 place of refuge and as an asylum, Moses gave a sort of inferior sanctity to the cities above
 mentioned, allowing them to give great security, by reason of the privileges and honours conferred
 upon the inhabitants, who were to be justified in protecting their suppliants if any superior power
 endeavoured to bring force against them, not by warlike preparations, but by rank, and dignity, and
 honour, which they had from the laws by reason of the venerable character of the priesthood.
 (160) But the fugitive, when he has once got within the borders of the city to which he has fled for
 refuge, must be kept close within it, because of the avengers waiting for him on the outside, being
 the relations by blood of the man who has been slain, and who, out of regret for their kinsman,
 even if he has been slain by one who did not intend to do so, are still eager for the blood of him
 who slew him, their individual and private grief overpowering their accurate notions of what is right.
 And should he go forth from the city, let him know that he is going forth to undoubted destruction;
 for he will not escape the notice of any one of the slain man's relations, by whom he will at once be
 taken in nets and toils, and so he will perish. (161) And the limit of his banishment shall be the life of
 the high priest; and when he is dead, he shall be pardoned and return to his own city. Moses,
 having promulgated these and similar laws about the priests, proceeds to enact others concerning
 animals, as to what beasts are suitable for Sacrifice.{20}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title
 at this point: On Animals Fit for Sacrifice, or On Victims. Accordingly, his next paragraph begins with roman numeral I
  (= XXXIII in the Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes with number XV (= XLVII in the Loeb). The publisher has elected to
 follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 XXXIII. (162) Or the creatures which are fit to be offered as sacrifices, some are land animals,
 and some are such as fly through the air. Passing over, therefore, the infinite varieties of birds,
 God chose only two classes out of them all, the turtledove and the pigeon; because the pigeon is
 by nature the most gentle of all those birds which are domesticated and gregarious, and the
 turtle-dove the most gentle of those which love solitude. (163) Also, passing over the innumerable
 troops of land animals, whose very numbers it is not easy to ascertain, he selected these
 especially as the best--the oxen, and sheep, and goats; for these are the most gentle and the
 most manageable of all animals. At all events, great herds of oxen, and numerous flocks of goats
 and sheep, are easily driven by any one, not merely by any man, but by any little child, when they go
 forth to pasture, and in the same way they are brought back to their folds in good order when the
 time comes. (164) And of this gentleness, there are many other proofs, and the most evident are
 these: that they all feed on herbage, and that no one of them is carnivorous, and that they have
 neither crooked talons, nor any projecting tusks or teeth whatever; for the back parts of the upper
 jaw do not hold teeth, but all the incisor teeth are deficient in them: (165) and, besides these facts,
 they are of all animals the most useful to man. Rams are the most useful for the necessary
 covering of the body; oxen, for ploughing the ground and preparing the arable land for seed, and
 for the growth of the crops that shall hereafter come to be threshed out, in order that men may
 partake of and enjoy food; and the hair and fleeces of goats, where one is woven, or the other
 sewn together, make movable tents for travellers, and especially for men engaged in military
 expeditions, whom their necessities constantly compel to abide outside of the city in the open air.
<p>
 XXXIV. (166) And the victims must be whole and entire, without any blemish on any part of their
 bodies, unmutilated, perfect in every part, and without spot or defect of any kind. At all events, so
 great is the caution used with respect not only to those who offer the sacrifices, but also to the
 victims which are offered, that the most eminent of the priests are carefully selected to examine
 whether they have any blemishes or not, and scrutinise them from head to foot, inspecting not only
 those parts which are easily visible, but all those which are more out of sight, such as the belly and
 the thighs, lest any slight imperfection should escape notice. (167) And the accuracy and
 minuteness of the investigation is directed not so much on account of the victims themselves, as in
 order that those who offer them should be irreproachable; for God designed to teach the Jews by
 these figures, whenever they went up to the altars, when there to pray or to give thanks, never to
 bring with them any weakness or evil passion in their soul, but to endeavour to make it wholly and
 entirely bright and clean, without any blemish, so that God might not turn away with aversion from
 the sight of it.
<p>
 XXXV. (168) And since, of the sacrifices to be offered, some are on behalf of the whole nation,
 and indeed, if one should tell the real truth, in behalf of all mankind, while others are only in behalf of
 each individual who has chosen to offer them; we must speak first of all of those which are for the
 common welfare of the whole nation, and the regulations with respect to this kind of sacrifice are of
 a marvellous nature. (169) For some of them are offered up every day, and some on the days of
 the new moon, and at the festivals of the full moon; others on days of fasting; and others at three
 different occasions of festival. Accordingly, it is commanded that every day the priests should offer
 up two lambs, one at the dawn of day, and the other in the evening; each of them being a sacrifice
 of thanksgiving; the one for the kindnesses which have been bestowed during the day, and the
 other for the mercies which have been vouchsafed in the night, which God is incessantly and
 uninterruptedly pouring upon the race of men. (170) And on the seventh day he doubles the
 number of victims to be offered, giving equal honour to equal things, inasmuch as he looks upon
 the seventh day as equal in dignity to eternity, since he has recorded it as being the birthday of the
 whole world. On which account he has thought fit to make the sacrifice to be offered on the
 seventh day, equal to the continuation of what is usually sacrificed in one day. (171) Moreover, the
 most fragrant of all incenses are offered up twice every day in the fire, being burnt within the veil,
 both when the sun rises and sets, before the morning and after the evening sacrifice, so that the
 sacrifices of blood display our gratitude for ourselves as being composed of blood, but the
 offerings of incense show our thankfulness for the dominant part within us, our rational spirit, which
 was fashioned after the archetypal model of the divine image. (172) And loaves are placed on the
 seventh day on the sacred table, being equal in number to the months of the year, twelve loaves,
 arranged in two rows of six each, in accordance with the arrangement of the equinoxes; for there
 are two equinoxes every year, the vernal and the autumnal, which are each reckoned by periods of
 six months. At the vernal equinox all the seeds sown in the ground begin to ripen; about which time,
 also, the trees begin to put forth their fruit. And by the autumnal one the fruit of the trees has
 arrived at a perfect ripeness; and at this period, again, is the beginning of seed time. Thus nature,
 going through a long course of time, showers gifts after gifts upon the race of man, the symbols of
 which are the two sixes of loaves thus placed on the table. (173) And these loaves, also, do
 figuratively intimate that most useful of all virtues, temperance; which is attended by frugality, and
 economy, and moderation as so many bodyguards, on account of the pernicious attacks which
 intemperance and covetousness prepare to make upon it. For, to a lover of wisdom, a loaf is a
 sufficient nourishment, keeping the bodies free from disease, and the intellect sound, and healthy,
 and sober. (174) But high seasonings, and cheesecakes, and sweetmeats, and all the other
 delicacies which the superfluous skill of confectioners and cooks concoct to cajole the illiterate,
 and unphilosophical, and most slavish of all the outward senses, namely, taste, which is never
 influenced by any noble sight, or by any perceptible lesson, but only by desire to indulge the
 appetites of the miserable belly, constantly engenders incurable diseases both in the body and the
 mind. (175) And with the loaves there is also placed on the table frankincense and salt. The one as
 a symbol that there is no sweetmeat more fragrant and wholesome than economy and
 temperance, if wisdom is to be the judge; while salt is an emblem of the duration of all things (for
 salt preserves everything over which it is sprinkled), and also of sufficient seasoning. (176) I know
 that those men who devote themselves wholly to drinking parties and banquets, and who care only
 for costly entertainments, will make a mock at these things and turn them into ridicule, miserable
 slaves as they are of birds, and fishes, and meat, and all such nonsense as that, and not being
 able to taste of true freedom, not even in a dream. And all such men are to be disregarded and
 despised by those who seek to live in accordance with the will of God, in a manner pleasing to the
 true and living God; who, having learnt to despise the pleasures of the flesh, pursue the delights
 and luxuries of the mind, having exercised themselves in the contemplation of the objects of
 Nature.{21}{sections 177û193 were omitted in Yonge's translation because the edition on which Yonge based his
 translation, Mangey, lacked this material. These sections have been newly translated for this edition.} (177) After he
 had ordered these things concerning the seventh day, he said that for the new moons it is
 necessary to offer ten whole burntofferings in all: two young bulls, one ram, seven lambs. For since
 the month is perfect in which the moon makes its way through its cycle, he thought that a perfect
 number of animals should be Sacrificed.{22}{an alternative would be to understand teleion as a predicate
 adjective and supply an einai which would mean "that the number of animals to be sacrificed should be perfect." The
 absence of a definite article before "perfect number" suggests the translation in the text is preferable.} (178) The
 number ten is the completely perfect number which he most appropriately assigned to the animals
 which have been mentioned: the two young bulls since there are two motions of the moon as it
 continually runs its double-course--the motion of waxing until full moon and the motion of waning
 until its conjunction with the sun; one ram since there is one principle of reason by which the moon
 waxes and wanes in equal intervals, both as it increases and diminishes in illumination; the seven
 lambs because it receives the perfect shapes in periods of seven days--the half-moon in the first
 seven day period after its conjunction with the sun, full moon in the second; and when it makes its
 return again, the first is to half-moon, then it ceases at its conjunction with the sun. (179) With the
 sacrificial victims he ordered that the finest wheaten flour mixed with oil be offered and wine in
 stipulated amounts for drink-offerings. The reason is that even these are brought to maturity by the
 orbits of the moon in the annual seasons, especially as the moon helps to ripen fruits; wheat and
 wine and oil--the most helpful substances for life and the most essential for use by humans--are
 suitably dedicated together with all sacrifices. (180) For the feast which begins the sacred
 Month{23}{the exact meaning of ieromeµnia is unclear. The best explanation of the term was suggested by a scholiast
 on Pindar Nem. 3.2 who explained that the beginnings of months were sacred (A. B. Drachmann, Scholia Vetera in Pindari
 Carmina [3 vols., Leipzig: B. G. Teubner, 1903û27] 3:42). Thus understood to be Philo's designation for the feast day
 which opens the sacred month, it is here consistently translated "the feast which begins the sacred month."} double
 sacrifices are fitly offered since the reason for it is double: one, since it is the new moon; the
 other, since it is the feast which begins the sacred month. Regarding the fact that it is the new
 moon it is distinctly stated that sacrifices equal to the other new moons are to be sacrificed.
 Regarding the fact that it is the feast which begins the sacred month, the gifts are doubled apart
 from the young bulls. For one rather than two is offered since the judge has thought it correct to
 use the indivisible nature of the number one instead of the divisible number two at the beginning of
 the year. (181) In the first season--he calls springtime and its equinox the first season--he
 ordered that a feast which is called "the feast of unleavened bread" be celebrated for seven days
 and declared that every day was equal in honor in religious services. For he commanded that each
 day ten whole burnt offerings should be sacrificed just as they are for the new moons, making the
 total number of whole burnt offerings apart from those dealing with the trespass offerings seventy.
 (182) For he thought that the same reason governed the relation of the new moon to the month
 which governed the relation of the seven days of the feast to the equinox that took place in the
 seventh month. As a result he declared sacred both the beginning of each month and the
 beginning, consisting of the same number of days as the new moons, of the aggregate seven
 months. (183) In the middle of spring the harvest takes place during which season thank offerings
 are offered to God from the field because it has produced fruit in abundance and the crops are
 being harvested. This feast is the most publicly celebrated feast and is called "the feast of the first
 produce," named etymologically from the circumstance that the first of the produce, the first fruits,
 are dedicated at that time. (184) We are ordered to offer two young bulls as sacrifices, one ram,
 and seven lambs--these ten are sacred whole burnt offerings--and in addition, two lambs as meat
 for the priests which he calls "lambs of preservation" since food is preserved for humans out of
 multiple and varied circumstances. For destructive forces frequently occur: some by heavy rains,
 some by droughts, some by other unspeakably great changes in nature; and again, some are
 humanly produced through the invasion of enemies who attempt to lay waste their neighbors' land.
 (185) Suitably then, the preservation offerings are offered to the one who has dispersed all plots
 as thank offerings. They are offered with loaves which, after the people have brought them to the
 altar and lifted them up to heaven, they give to the priests along with the meat of the sacrifice of
 preservation for a most appropriate sacred feast. (186) When the third season takes place in the
 seventh month at the autumnal equinox, at the beginning of the month, the feast which begins the
 sacred month named "the feast of trumpets" and which was discussed earlier is celebrated. On the
 tenth day the fast takes place which they take seriously--not only those who are zealous about
 piety and holiness, but even those who do nothing religious the rest of the time. For all are
 astounded, overcome with the sacredness of it; in fact, at that time the worse compete with the
 better in selfcontrol and virtue. (187) The reputation of the day is due to two reasons: one that it is
 a feast and the other that it is purification and escape from sins for which anmesty has been given
 by the favors of the gracious God who has assigned the same honor to repentance that he has to
 not committing a single Sin.{24}{l. Cohn emended meµden to meµde in order to avoid the notion of sinlessness in
 the text. The translation follows the MSS since they offer the more difficult reading and this is a rhetorical statement
 designed to commend repentance, not make an observation on human perfection.} (188) Therefore he declared
 that since it was a feast the sacrifices should be the same number as those of the feast which
 begins the sacred month: a young bull, a ram, and seven lambs. In this way he mixed the number
 one with the number seven and lined the end up with the beginning, for the number seven has been
 appointed the end of things and the number one the beginning. He added three sacrifices since it
 was for purification. For he ordered that two hegoats and a ram be offered. Then he said that it
 was necessary to offer the ram as a whole burnt offering, but to cast lots for the he-goats. The
 hegoat selected by lot for God must be sacrificed, but the other was to be sent out into a pathless
 and inaccessible desolate place carrying on himself the curses of those who had committed
 offenses, but who were purified by changes for the better and who have washed themselves from
 their old lawlessness with a new sense of loyalty to the law. (189) On the fifteenth day, at full moon,
 the feast which is called "the feast of booths" is celebrated for which the supplies of the sacrifices
 are more numerous. For during seven days, seventy young bulls, fourteen rams and ninety-eight
 lambs are sacrificed--all animals as whole burnt offerings. We are ordered to consider the eighth
 day sacred, a day which I must deal with carefully when the entire account of the feasts is
 thoroughly examined. On this day as many sacrifices are offered as on the feast which begins the
 sacred month. (190) The sacrifices which are whole burnt offerings and are joint offerings on
 behalf of the nation or--to speak more accurately--on behalf of the entire race of humanity have
 been addressed to the best of my ability. However, a he-goat accompanies the whole burnt
 offerings on each day of the feast. He is called "concerning sins" and is sacrificed for the
 forgiveness of sins. His meat is Distributed{25}{although S. Daniel included a negative in her edition (PAPM
 24)--[ouk] aponemetai ("is not distributed")--in order to harmonize this statement with 1.232 and 1.244, this translation
 has followed the more difficult reading.} to the priests for food. (191) What is the reason for this? Is it
 because a feast is a time of good cheer, and undeceiving and true good cheer is good sense
 firmly established in the soul, and this unwavering good sense is impossible to receive without a
 cure from sins and cutting off of the passions? For it would be out of place if each of the animals of
 the whole burnt offerings is sacrificed only when it is found undamaged and unhurt, but the mind of
 the sacrificer has not been purified in every way and cleansed by making use of washings and
 lustrations which the right reason of nature pours into God-loving souls through healthy and
 uncorrupt ears. (192) In addition the following ought to be said. These festal and holiday rests have
 in the past often opened up countless avenues to sins. For unmixed beverage and luxurious diets
 with excessive drinking arouse the insatiable desires of the stomach and also kindle the desires of
 the parts beneath the stomach. As these desires both flow and stream out in every way, they
 produce a surge of unspeakable evils using the fearless stimulant of the feast as a refuge to avoid
 suffering anything. (193) Knowing these things, he did not allow them to celebrate a feast in the
 same way as other peoples, but at the very time of good cheer he first commanded that they purify
 themselves by bridling the impulses of pleasure. Then he summoned them into the temple for
 participation in hymns and prayers and sacrifices so that both from the place and from the things
 seen and said through the most powerful of senses, sight and hearing, they might come to love
 self-control and piety. Last of all, he reminded them not to sin through the sacrifice for sin. For the
 one who is asking for anmesty for the sins he has committed is not so dominated by evil that at the
 very time he is asking for release from old wrongs he should begin other new ones.
<p>
 XXXVI. (194) After the lawgiver has given these commands with reference to these subjects, he
 begins to distinguish between the different kinds of sacrifices, and he divides the victims into three
 classes. The most important of which he makes a whole burnt offering; the next an offering for
 preservation; the last, a sin-offering. And then he adapts suitable ceremonies and rites to each,
 aiming, in no inadequate manner, at what is at the same time decorous and holy. (195) And the
 distinction which he makes is one of great beauty and propriety, having a close connection and a
 sort of natural kindred with the things themselves; for if any one were to wish to examine minutely
 the causes for which it seemed good to the first men to betake themselves at the same time to
 sacrifices to show their gratitude, and also to supplications, he will find two most especial reasons
 for this conduct. Firstly, that it conduces to the honour of God, which ought to be aimed at not for
 the sake of any other reason, but for itself alone, as being both honourable and necessary; and,
 secondly, for the benefits which have been poured upon the sacrificers themselves, as has been
 said before. And the benefit they derive is also twofold, being both an admission to a share of good
 things and a deliverance from evils. (196) Therefore the law has assigned the whole burnt offering
 as a sacrifice adequate to that honour which is suited to God, and which belongs to God alone,
 enjoining that what is offered to the allperfect and absolute God must be itself entire and perfect,
 having no taint of mortal selfishness in it. But that sacrifice which is offered for the sake of men,
 since its appearance admits of distinction, the law has distinguished also, appointing it to be a
 sacrifice for the participation in blessings which mankind has enjoined, and calling it a
 thank-offering for their preservation. And for the deliverance from evils it has allotted the sacrifice
 called a sin-offering, so that these are very appropriately their sacrifices for these causes; (197)
 the whole burntoffering being sacrificed for God himself alone, who must be honoured for his own
 sake, and not for that of any other being or thing; and the others for our sake; the thank-offering for
 our preservation, for the safety and amelioration of human affairs; and the sin-offering for the cure
 of those offences which the soul has committed.
<p>
 XXXVII. (198) And we must now enumerate the laws which have been enacted respecting each
 sacrifice, making our commencement with that which is the most excellent. Now, the most excellent
 sacrifice is the whole burnt-offering. The law says, "In the first place the victim shall be a male,
 carefully selected for its excellence from all the animals which are fit for sacrifice, a calf, or a lamb,
 or a kid. And then let him who brings it wash his hands, and lay his hands on the head of the victim.
 (199) And after this let some one of the priests take the victim and sacrifice it, and let another hold
 a bowl under it, and, having caught some of the blood, let him go all around the altar and sprinkle it
 with the blood, and let him flay the victim and divide it into large pieces, having washed its entrails
 and its feet. And then let the whole victim be given to the fire of the altar of God, {26}{#le 1:3.}
 having become many things instead of one, and one instead of many." (200) These things, then,
 are comprehended in express words of command. But there is another meaning figuratively
 concealed under the enigmatical expressions. And the words employed are visible symbols of what
 is invisible and uncertain. Now the victim which is to be sacrificed as a whole burnt offering must be
 a male, because a male is both more akin to domination than a female and more nearly related to
 the efficient cause; for the female is imperfect, subject, seen more as the passive than as the
 active partner. (201) And since the elements of which our soul consists are two in number, the
 rational and the irrational part, the rational part belongs to the male sex, being the inheritance of
 intellect and reason; but the irrational part belongs to the sex of woman, which is the lot also of the
 outward senses. And the mind is in every respect superior to the outward sense, as the man is to
 the woman; who, when he is without blemish and purified with the proper purifications, namely, the
 perfect virtues, is himself the most holy sacrifice, being wholly and in all respects pleasing to God.
 (202) Again, the hands which are laid upon the head of the victim are a most manifest symbol of
 irreproachable actions, and of a life which does nothing which is open to accusation, but which in
 all respects is passed in a manner consistent with the laws and ordinances of nature; (203) for the
 law, in the first place, desires that the mind of the man who is offering the sacrifice shall be made
 holy by being exercised in good and advantageous doctrines; and, in the second place, that his life
 shall consist of most virtuous actions, so that, in conjunction with the imposition of hands, the man
 may speak freely out of his cleanly conscience, and may say, (204) "These hands have never
 received any gift as a bribe to commit an unjust action, nor any division of what has been obtained
 by rapine or by covetousness, nor have they shed innocent blood. nor have they wrought
 mutilation, nor works of insolence, nor acts of violence, nor have they inflicted any wounds; nor, in
 fact, have they performed any action whatever which is liable to accusation or to reproach, but
 have been ministers in everything which is honourable and advantageous, and which is honoured
 by wisdom, or by the laws, or by honourable and virtuous men."
<p>
 XXXVIII. (205) And the blood is poured out in a circle all round the altar, because a circle is the
 most complete of all figures, and also in order that no part whatever may be left empty and
 unoccupied by the libation of life; for, to speak properly, the blood is the libation of the life.
 Therefore the law here symbolically teaches us that the mind, which is always performing its
 dances in a circle, is by every description of words, and intentions, and actions which it adopts,
 always showing its desire to please God. (206) And it is commanded that the belly and the feet
 shall be washed, which command is a figurative and very expressive one; for, by the belly it is
 figuratively meant to be signified that it is desirable that the appetites shall be purified, which are full
 of stains, and intoxication, and drunkenness, being thus a most pernicious evil, existing, and
 concocted, and exercised to the great injury of the life of mankind. (207) And by the command that
 the feet of the victim should be washed, it is figuratively shown that we must no longer walk upon
 the earth, but soar aloft and traverse the air. For the soul of the man who is devoted to God, being
 eager for truth, springs upward and mounts from earth to heaven; and, being borne on wings,
 traverses the expanse of the air, being eager to be classed with and to move in concert with the
 sun, and moon, and all the rest of the most sacred and most harmonious company of the stars,
 under the immediate command and government of God, who has a kingly authority without any
 rival, and of which he can never be deprived, in accordance with which he justly governs the
 universe. (208) And the division of the animal into limbs shows plainly that all things are but one, or
 that they are derived from one, and dissolved into one; which some persons have called satiety
 and also want, while others have called it combustion and arrangement: combustion, in accordance
 with the supreme power of God, who rules all other things in the world; and arrangement, according
 to the equality of the four elements which they all mutually allow to one another. (209) And when I
 have been investigating these matters, this has appeared to me to be a probable conjecture; the
 soul which honours the living God, ought for that very reason to honour him not inconsiderately nor
 ignorantly, but with knowledge and reason; and the reasoning which we indulge in respecting God
 admits of division and partition, according to each of the divine faculties and excellencies; for God
 is both all good, and is also the maker and creator of the universe; and he also created it having a
 foreknowledge of what would take place, and being its preserver and most blessed benefactor, full
 of every kind of happiness; all which circumstances have in themselves a most dignified and
 praiseworthy character, both separately and when looked at in conjunction with their kindred
 qualities; (210) and we must speak in the same way of other matters. When you wish to give
 thanks to God with your mind, and to assert your gratitude for the creation of the world, give him
 thanks for the creation of it as a whole, and of all its separate parts in their integrity, as if for the
 limbs of a most perfect animal; and by the parts I mean, for instance, the heaven, and the sun, and
 the moon, and the fixed stars; and secondly the earth, and the animals, and plants which spring
 from it; and next the seas and rivers, whether naturally springing from the ground or swollen by rain
 as winter torrents, and all the things in them: and lastly, the air and all the changes that take place in
 it; for winter, and summer, and spring, and autumn, being the seasons of the year, and being all of
 great service to mankind, are what we may call affections of the air for the preservation of all these
 things that are beneath the moon. (211) And if ever you give thanks for men and their fortunes, do
 not do so only for the race taken generally, but you shall give thanks also for the species and most
 important parts of the race, such as men and women, Greeks and barbarians, men on the
 continent, and those who have their habitation in the islands; and if you are giving thanks for one
 individual, do not divide your thankfulness in expression into gratitude for minute trifles and
 inconsiderable matters, but take in your view the most comprehensive circumstances, first of all,
 his body and his soul, of which he consists, and then his speech, and his mind, and his outward
 senses; for such gratitude cannot of itself be unworthy of being listened to by God, when uttered,
 for each of these particulars.
<p>
 XXXIX. (212) These things are enough for us to say respecting the sacrifice of the whole
 burntoffering. We must now proceed in due order to consider that offering which is called the
 sacrifice for preservation; for with respect to this one it is a matter of consequence whether the
 victim be male or female; and when it is slain, these three parts are especially selected for the
 altar, the fat, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys; and all the other parts are left to make a
 feast for the sacrificer; (213) and we must consider with great accuracy the reason why these
 portions of the entrails are in this case looked upon as sacred, and not pass this point by
 carelessly. Often when I have been considering this matter in my own mind, and investigating all
 these commandments, I have doubted why the law selected the lobe of the liver, and the kidneys,
 and the fat, as the first fruits of the animals thus sacrificed; and did not choose the heart or the
 brain, though the dominant part of the man resides in one of these parts; (214) and I think also that
 many other persons who read the sacred scriptures with their mind, rather than merely with their
 eyes, will ask the same question. If therefore they, when they have considered the matter, can find
 any more probable reason, they will be benefiting both themselves and us; but if they cannot, let
 them consider the cause which has been discovered by us, and see whether it will stand the test;
 and this is it. The dominant power alone of all those that exist in us is able to restrain our natural
 folly, and injustice, and cowardice, and our other vices, and does restrain them; and the abode of
 this dominant power is one or other of the aforesaid portions of us, that is, it is either the brain or
 the heart; (215) therefore the sacred commandment has thought fit that one should not bring to the
 altar of God, by means of which a remission and complete pardon of all sins and transgressions is
 procured, that vessel from which the mind having at one time been abiding in it, has gone forth on
 the trackless road of injustice and impiety, having turned out of the way which leads to virtue and
 excellence; for it would be folly to suppose that sacrifices were not to procure a forgetfulness of
 offences, but were to act as a reminder of them. This it is which appears to me to be the reason
 why neither of those two parts, which are of supreme importance, namely, the brain or the heart, is
 brought to the altar; (216) and the parts which are commanded to be brought have a very suitable
 reason why they should be; the fat is brought because it is the richest part, and that which guards
 the entrails; for it envelops them and makes them to flourish, and benefits them by the softness of
 its touch. And the kidneys are commanded to be selected on account of the adjacent parts and the
 organs of generation, which they, as they dwell near them, do, like good neighbours, assist and
 co-operate with, in order that the seed of nature may prosper without anything in its vicinity being
 any obstacle to it; for they are channels resembling blood, by which that part of the purification of
 the superfluities of the body which is moist is separated from the body; and the testicles are near
 by which the seed is irrigated. And the lobe of the liver is the first fruit of the most important of the
 entrails, by means of which the food is digested, and being conveyed into the stomach is diffused
 through all the veins, and so conduces to the durability of the whole body; (217) for the stomach,
 lying close to the gullet which swallows the food, receives it as soon after it has first been chewed
 by the teeth and been made smooth, and so digests it; and the body again receives it from the
 stomach and performs the second part of the service required, to which indeed it has been
 destined by nature, giving forth a juice to aid in liquefying the food; and there are tow pipes like
 channels in the belly, which pour forth chyle into the liver, through the two channels which are
 originally placed in it. (218) And the liver has a twofold power, a secretive one, and also a power of
 making blood. Now the secretive power secretes everything which is hard and difficult to be
 digested, and removes it into the adjacent vessels of gall; and the other power turns all that portion
 of the food which is pure and properly strained, by the means of its own innate flame, into life-like
 vivifying blood; and presses it into the heart, from which, as has been already said, it is conveyed
 through the veins and by these channels is diffused through the whole body to which it becomes
 the nourishment. (219) We must also add to what has been here said, that the nature of the liver
 being a lofty character and very smooth, by reason of its smoothness is looked upon as a very
 transparent mirror, so that when the mind, retreating from the cares of the day (while the body is
 lying relaxed in sleep, and while no one of the outward senses is any hindrance or impediment),
 begins to roll itself about, and to consider the objects of its thought by itself without any interruption,
 looking into the liver as into a mirror, it then sees, very clearly and without any alloy, every one of
 the proper objects of the intellect, and looking round upon all vain idols, and seeing that no disgrace
 can accrue to it, but taking care to avoid that and to choose the contrary, and being contented and
 pleased with all that it sees, it by dreams obtains a prophetic sight of the future.
<p>
 XL. (220) And there are two days only during which God permits the nation to make use of the
 sacrifice for preservation, enjoining them to carve nothing of it till the third day, on many accounts,
 first of all, because all the things which are ever placed on the sacred table, ought to be made use
 of in due season, while the users take care that they shall suffer no deterioration from the lapse of
 time; but the nature of meat that has been kept is very apt to become putrid, even though it may
 have been seasoned in the cooking; (221) secondly, because it is fitting that the sacrifices should
 not be stored up for food, but should be openly exposed, so as to afford a meal to all who are in
 need of it, for the sacrifice when once placed on the altar, is no longer the property of the person
 who has offered it, but belongs to that Being to whom the victim is sacrificed, who, being a
 beneficent and bounteous God, makes the whole company of those who offer the sacrifice,
 partakers at the altar and messmates, only admonishing them not to look upon it as their own feast,
 for they are but stewards of the feast, and not the entertainers; and the entertainer is the man to
 whom all the preparation belongs, which it is not lawful to conceal while preferring parsimony and
 illiberal meanness to humanity which is a noble virtue. (222) Lastly, this command was given
 because it so happens that the sacrifice for preservation is offered up for two things, the soul and
 the body, to each of which the lawgiver has assigned one day for feasting on the meats, for it was
 becoming that a number of days should be allotted for this purpose equal to the number of those
 parts in us which were designed to be sacred; so that in the first day we should, together with our
 eating of the food, receive a recollection of the salvation of our souls; and on the second day be
 reminded of the sound health of our bodies. (223) And since there is no third object which is
 naturally appointed as one that should receive preservation, he has, with all possible strictness,
 forbidden the use of those meats being reserved to the third day, commanding that if it should so
 happen that, out of ignorance or forgetfulness, any portion was left, it should be consumed with
 fire; and he declares that the man who has merely tasted of it is blameable, saying to him, "Though
 thinking that you were sacrificing, O foolish man, you have not sacrificed; I have not accepted the
 unholy, unconsecrated, profane, unclean meats which you have roasted, O gluttonous man; never,
 even in a dream, having a proper idea of sacrifice."
<p>
 XLI. (224) To this species of sacrifice for preservation that other sacrifice also belongs, which is
 called the sacrifice of praise, and which rests on the following Principle.{27}{#le 19:1.} The man
 who has never fallen into any unexpected disaster whatever, neither as to his body nor as to his
 external circumstances, but who has passed a tranquil and peaceful life, living in happiness and
 prosperity, being free from all calamity and all mishap, steering through the long voyage of life in
 calmness and serenity of circumstances, good fortune always blowing upon the stern of his vessel,
 is, of necessity, bound to requite God, who has been the pilot of his voyage, who has bestowed
 upon him untroubled salvation and unalloyed benefits, and, in short, all sorts of blessings unmingled
 with any evil, with hymns, and songs, an prayers, and also with sacrifices, and all other imaginable
 tokens of gratitude in a holy manner; all which things taken together have received the one
 comprehensive name of praise. (225) This sacrifice the lawgiver has not commanded to be
 spread like the one before mentioned over two days, {28}{#le 7:5.} but he has confined it to one
 only, in order that these men, who meet with ready benefits freely poured upon them, may offer up
 their requital freely and without any delay.
<p>
 XLII. (226) This is sufficient to say on these subjects. We must now proceed, in due order, to
 consider the third sacrifice, which is called the sinoffering. This is varied in many ways, both in
 respect to the persons and to the description of victims offered; in respect of persons, that is, of
 the high priest, and of the whole nation, and of the ruler in his turn, and of the private individual; in
 respect of the victim offered, whether it be a calf, or a kid, or a she-goat, or a lamb. (227) Also
 there is a distinction made, which is very necessary, as to whether they are voluntary or
 involuntary, with reference to those who, after they have erred, change for the better, confessing
 that they have sinned, and reproaching themselves for the offences that they have committed, and
 turning, for the future, to an irreproachable way of life. (228) The sins therefore of the high priest,
 and of the whole nation, are atoned for by animals of equal value, for the priest is commanded to
 offer up a calf for each. The sins of the ruler are atoned for by an inferior animal, but still a male,
 for a kid is the appointed victim. The sins of the private individual by a victim of an inferior species,
 for it is a female, not a male, a she-goat, that is sacrificed; (229) for it was fitting that a ruler should
 be ranked above a private individual, even in his performance of sacred ceremonies also: but the
 nation is superior to the ruler, since the whole must, at all times, be superior to the part. But the
 high priest is accounted worthy of the same honour as the whole nation, in respect of purification
 and of entreating a forgiveness of his sins from the merciful power of God. And he receives an
 equality of honour, not so much as it appears for his own sake, as because he is a servant of the
 nation, offering up a common thank-offering for them all in his most sacred prayers and most holy
 sacrifices. (230) And the commandment given respecting these matters is one of great dignity and
 admirable solemnity. "If," says the law, "the high priest have sinned unintentionally," and then it
 adds, "so that the people has sinned too," all but affirming in express words that the true high
 priest, not the one incorrectly called so, has no participation in sin; and if ever he stumble, this will
 happen to him, not for his own sake, but for the common errors of the nation, and this error is not
 incurable, but is one which easily admits of a remedy. (231) When, therefore, the calf has been
 sacrificed, the lawgiver commands the sacrificer to sprinkle some of the blood with his finger
 seven times in front of the veil which is before the holy of holies, within the former veil, in which
 place the sacred vessels are placed; and after that to smear and anoint the four horns of the altar,
 for it is square; and to pour out the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar, which is in the open air.
 (232) And to this altar they are commanded to bring three things, the fat, and the lobe of the liver,
 and the two kidneys, in accordance with the commandment given with reference to the sacrifice for
 preservation; but the skin and the flesh, and all the rest of the body of the calf, from the head to the
 feet, with the entrails, they are commanded to carry out and to turn in an open place, to which the
 sacred ashes from the altar have been conveyed. The lawgiver also gives the same command with
 respect to the whole nation when it has sinned. (233) But if any ruler has sinned he makes his
 purification with a kid, {29}{#le 4:22.} as I have said before; and if a private individual has sinned,
 he must offer a she-goat or a lamb; and for the ruler he appoints a male victim, but to the private
 individual a female, making all his other injunctions the same in both cases, to anoint the horns of
 the altar in the open air with blood, to bring the fat and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and
 to give the rest of the victim to the priests to eat.
<p>
 XLIII. (234) But since, of offences some are committed against men, and some against holy and
 sacred things; he has hitherto been speaking with reference to those which are unintentionally
 committed against men; but for the purification of such as have been committed against sacred
 things he commands a ram to be offered up, after the offender has first paid the value of the thing
 to which the offence related, adding one fifth to the exact value. (235) And after having put forth
 these and similar enactments with reference to sins committed unintentionally, he proceeds to lay
 down rules respecting intentional offences. "If any one," says the law, "shall speak falsely
 concerning a partnership, or about a deposit, or about a theft, or about the finding of something
 which another has lost, and being suspected and having had an oath proposed to him, shall swear,
 and when he appears to have escaped all conviction at the hands of this accusers, shall himself
 become his own accuser, being convicted by his own conscience residing within, and shall
 reproach himself for the things which he has denied, and as to which he has sworn falsely, and
 shall come and openly confess the sin which he has committed, and implore pardon; (236) then
 pardon shall be given to such a man, who shows the truth of his repentance, not by promises but by
 works, by restoring the deposit which he has received, and by giving up the things which he has
 stolen or found, or of which in short he has in any way deprived his neighbour, paying also in
 addition one fifth of the value, as an atonement for the evil which he had Done."{30}{#le 5:20.}
 (237) And then, after he has appeased the man who had been injured, the law proceeds to say,
 "After this let him go also into the temple, to implore remission of the sins which he has committed,
 taking with him an irreproachable mediator, namely, that conviction of the soul which has delivered
 him from his incurable calamity, curing him of the disease which would cause death, and wholly
 changing and bringing him to good health." And it orders that he should sacrifice a ram, and this
 victim is expressly mentioned, as it is in the case of the man who has offended in respect of the
 holy things; (238) for the law speaks of an unintentional offence in the matter of holy things as of
 equal importance with an intentional sin in respect of men; if we may not indeed say that this also is
 holy, since an oath is added to it, which, as having been taken for an unjust cause, it has corrected
 by an alteration for the better. (239) And we must take notice that the parts of the victim slain as a
 sin-offering which are placed upon the altar, are the same as those which are taken from the
 sacrifice for preservation, namely the lobe of the liver, and the fat, and the kidneys; for in a manner
 we may speak also of the man who repents as being preserved, since he is cured of a disease of
 the soul, which is worse than the diseases of the body; (240) but the other parts of the animal are
 assigned to be eaten in a different manner; and the difference consists in three things; in the
 place, and time, and in those who receive It.{31}{#le 6:9.} Now the place is the temple; the time is
 one day instead of two; and the persons who partake of it are the priests, and the male servants of
 the priests, but not the men who offer the sacrifice. (241) Therefore the law does not permit the
 sacrifice to be brought out of the temple, with the intent that, if the man who repents has committed
 any previous offence also, he may not now be overwhelmed by envious and malicious men, with
 foolish dispositions and unbridled tongues, always lying in wait for reproach and false accusation;
 but it must be eaten in the sacred precincts, within which the purification has taken place.
<p>
 XLIV. (242) And the law orders the priests to feast on what is offered in the sacrifice for many
 reasons; first of all, that by this command it may do honour to him who has offered the sacrifice,
 for the dignity of those who eat of the feast is an honour to those who furnish it; secondly, that they
 may believe the more firmly that those men who feel repentance for their sins do really have God
 propitious to them, for he would never have invited his servants and ministers to a participation in
 such a banquet, if his forgiveness of those who provided it had not been complete; and thirdly,
 because it is not lawful for any one of the priests to bear a part in the sacred ceremonies who is
 not perfect, for they are rejected for the slightest blemish. (243) And God comforts those who have
 ceased to travel by the road of wickedness, as if they now, by means of the race of the priesthood,
 had received a pure purpose of life for the future, and had been sent forth so as to obtain an equal
 share of honour with the priests. And it is for this reason that the victim sacrificed as a sin-offering
 is consumed in one day, because men ought to delay to sin, being always slow and reluctant to
 approach it, but to exert all possible haste and promptness in doing well. (244) But the sacrifices
 offered up for the sins of the high priest, or for those of the whole nation, are not prepared to be
 eaten at all, but are burnt to ashes, and the ashes are sacred as has been said; for there is no one
 who is superior to the high priest or to the whole nation, or who can as such be an intercessor for
 them, as to the sins which they have committed. (245) Very naturally, therefore, is the meat of this
 sacrifice ordered to be consumed by fire, in imitation of the whole burnt offerings, and this to the
 honour of those who offer it; not because the sacred judgments of God are given with reference to
 the rank of those who come before his tribunal, but because the offences committed by men of
 pre-eminent virtue and real holiness are accounted of a character nearly akin to the good actions
 of others; (246) for as a deep and fertile soil, even if it at times yields a bad crop, still bears more
 and better fruit than one which is naturally unproductive, so in the same manner it happens that the
 barrenness of virtuous and God-fearing men is more full of excellence than the best actions which
 ordinary people perform by chance; for these men cannot intentionally endure to do anything
 blameable.
<p>
 XLV. (247) Having given these commandments about every description of sacrifice in its turn,
 namely, about the burnt offering, and the sacrifice for preservation, and the sin-offering, he adds
 another kind of offering common to all the three, in order to show that they are friendly and
 connected with one another; and this combination of them all is called the great vow; (248) and why
 it received this appellation we must now proceed to say. When any persons offer first fruits from
 any portion of their possessions, wheat, or barley, or oil, or wine, or the best of their fruits, or the
 firstborn males of their flocks and herds, they do so actually dedicating those first fruits which
 proceed from what is clean, but paying a price as the value of what is unclean; and when they have
 no longer any materials left in which they can display their piety, they then consecrate and offer up
 themselves, displaying an unspeakable holiness, and a most superabundant excess of a
 God-loving disposition, on which account such a dedication is fitly called the great vow; for every
 man is his own greatest and most valuable possession, and this even he now gives up and
 abandons. (249) And when a man has vowed this vow the law gives him the following command;
 first of all, to touch no unmixed wine, nor any wine that is made of the grape, nor to drink any other
 strong drink whatever, to the destruction of his reason, considering that during this period his
 reason also is dedicated to God; for all which could tend to drunkenness is forbidden to those of
 the priests who are employed in the sacred ministrations, they being commanded to quench their
 thirst with water; (250) in the second place they are commanded not to show their heads, giving
 thus a visible sign to all who see them that they are not debasing the pure coinage of their vow;
 thirdly, they are commanded to keep their body pure and undefiled, so as not even to approach
 their parents if they are dead, nor their brothers; piety overcoming the natural good will and
 affection towards their relations and dearest friends, and it is both honourable and expedient that
 piety should at all times prevail.
<p>
 XLVI. (251) But when the appointed time for their being Released{32}{#nu 6:14.} from this vow has
 arrived, the law then commands the man who has dedicated himself to bring three animals to
 procure his release from his vow, a male lamb, and a female lamb, and a ram; the one for a burnt
 offering, the second for a sin-offering, and the ram as a sacrifice for preservation; (252) for in
 some sense the man who has made such a vow resembles all these things. He resembles the
 sacrifice of the entire burnt offering, because he is dedicating to his preserver not only a portion of
 the first fruits of other things, but also of his own self. And he resembles the sin-offering, inasmuch
 as he is a man; for there is no one born, however perfect he may be, who can wholly avoid the
 commission of sin. He resembles also the offering for preservation, inasmuch as he has recorded
 that God the saviour is the cause of his preservation, and does not ascribe it to any physician or to
 any power of his; for those who have been born themselves, and who are liable to infirmity, are not
 competent to bestow health even on themselves. Medicine does not benefit all persons, nor does it
 always benefit the same persons; but there are times even when it does them great injury, since its
 power depends on different things, both on the thing itself and also on those persons who use it.
 (253) And a great impression is made on me by the fact that of three animals offered up in these
 different sacrifices, there is no one of a different species from the others, but they are every one
 of the same kind, a ram, and a male lamb, and a female lamb; for God wishes, as I said a little while
 ago, by this commandment to point out that the three kinds of sacrifice are nearly connected with
 and akin to one another; because, both the man who repents is saved, and the man who is saved
 from the diseases of the soul repents, and because both of them hasten with eagerness to attain
 to an entire and perfect disposition, of which the sacrifice of the whole burnt-offering is a symbol.
 (254) But since the man has begun to offer himself as his first fruits, and since it is not lawful for
 the sacred altar to be polluted with human blood, but yet it was by all means necessary that a
 portion should be consecrated, he has taken care to take a portion, which, being taken, should
 cause neither pain nor defilement; for he has cut Off{33}{#nu 6:18.} the hair of the head, the
 superfluities of the natural body, as if they were the superfluous branches of a tree, and he has
 committed them to the fire on which the meat of the sacrifice offered for preservation will be
 suitably prepared, {34}{#le 6:13.} in order that some portion of the man who has made the vow,
 which it is not lawful to place upon the altar, may still at all events be combined with the sacrifice,
 burning the fuel of the sacred flame.
<p>
 XLVII. (255) These sacred fires are common to all the rest of the people. But it was fitting that the
 priests also should offer up something on the altar as first fruits, not thinking that the services and
 sacred ministrations to which they have been appointed have secured them an exemption from
 such duties. And the first fruits suitable for the priests to offer do not come from anything
 containing blood, but from the purest portion of human food; (256) for the fine wheaten flour is their
 continual offering; a tenth part of a sacred measure every day; one half of which is offered up in
 the morning, and one half in the evening, having been soaked in oil, so that no portion of it can be
 left for food; for the command of God is, that all the sacrifices of the priests shall be wholly burnt,
 and that no portion of them shall be allotted for food. Having now, then, to the best of our ability,
 discussed the matters relating to the sacrifices, we will proceed in due order to speak concerning
 those who offer Them.{35}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: On Those Who Offer
 Sacrifice. Accordingly, his next paragraph begins with roman numeral I (= XLVIII in the Loeb). Yonge's "treatise" concludes
 with number XVI (= LXIII in the Loeb). The publisher has elected to follow the Loeb numbering.}
<p>
 XLVIII. (257) The law chooses that a person who brings a sacrifice shall be pure, both in body and
 soul; --pure in soul from all passions, and diseases, and vices, which can be displayed either in
 word or deed; and pure in body from all such things as a body is usually defiled by. (258) And it has
 appointed a burning purification for both these things; for the soul, by means of the animals which
 are duly fit for sacrifices; and for the body, by ablutions and sprinklings; concerning which we will
 speak presently; for it is fit to assign the pre-eminence in honour in every point to the superior and
 dominant part of the qualities existing in us, namely, to the soul. (259) What, then, is the mode of
 purifying the soul? "Look," says the law, "take care that the victim which thou bringest to the altar is
 perfect, wholly without participation in any kind of blemish, selected from many on account of its
 excellence, by the uncorrupted judgments of the priests, and by their most acute sight, and by their
 continual practice derived from being exercised in the examination of faultless victims. For if you
 do not see this with your eyes more than with your reason, you will not wash off all the
 imperfections and stains which you have imprinted on your whole life, partly in consequence of
 unexpected events, and partly by deliberate purpose; (260) for you will find that this exceeding
 accuracy of investigation into the animals, figuratively signifies the amelioration of your own
 disposition and conduct; for the law was not established for the sake of irrational animals, but for
 that of those who have intellect and reason." So that the real object taken care of is not the
 condition of the victims sacrificed in order that they may have no blemish, but that of the sacrificers
 that they may not be defiled by any unlawful passion. (261) The body then, as I have already said,
 he purifies with ablutions and bespringklings, and does not allow a person after he has once
 washed and sprinkled himself, at once to enter within the sacred precincts, but bids him wait
 outside for seven days, and to be besprinkled twice, on the third day and on the seventh day; and
 after this it commands him to wash himself once more, and then it admits him to enter the sacred
 precincts and to share in the sacred ministrations.
<p>
 XLIX. (262) We must consider what great prudence and philosophical wisdom is displayed in this
 law; for nearly all other persons are besprinkled with pure water, generally in the sea, some in
 rivers, and others again in vessels of water which they draw from fountains. But Moses, having
 previously prepared ashes which had been left from the sacred fire (and in what manner shall be
 explained hereafter), appointed that it should be right to take some of them and to put them in a
 vessel, and then to pour water upon them, and then, dipping some branches of hyssop in the
 mixture of ashes and water, to sprinkle it over those who were to be purified. (263) And the cause
 of this proceeding may very probably be said to be this:--The lawgiver's intention is that those
 who approach the service of the living God should first of all know themselves and their own
 essence. For how can the man who does not know himself ever comprehend the supreme and
 all-excelling power of God? (264) Therefore, our bodily essence is earth and water, of which he
 reminds us by this purification, conceiving that this result--namely, to know one's self, and to know
 also of what one is composed, of what utterly valueless substances mere ashes and water are--is
 of itself the most beneficial purification. (265) For when a man is aware of this he will at once reject
 all vain and treacherous conceit, and, discarding haughtiness and pride, he will seek to become
 pleasing to God, and to conciliate the merciful power of that Being who hates arrogance. For it is
 said somewhere with great beauty, "He that exhibits over proud words or actions offends not men
 alone but God also, the maker of equality and of every thing else that is most excellent." (266)
 Therefore, to us who are amazed and excited by this sprinkling the very elements themselves,
 earth and water, may almost be said to utter distinct words, and to say plainly, we are the essence
 of your bodies; nature having mixed us together, divine art has fashioned us into the figure of a
 man. Being made of us when you were born, you will again be dissolved into us when you come to
 die; for it is not the nature of any thing to be destroyed so as to become non-existent; but the end
 brings it back to those elements from which its beginnings come.
<p>
 L. (267) But now it is necessary to fulfil our promise and to explain the peculiar propriety involved in
 this use of ashes. For they are not merely the ashes of wood which has been consumed by fire,
 but also of an animal particularly suited for this kind of purification. (268) For the law
 Orders{36}{#nu 19:1.} that a red heifer, which has never been brought under the yoke, shall be
 sacrificed outside of the city, and that the high priest, taking some of the blood, shall seven times
 sprinkle with it all the things in front of the temple, and then shall burn the whole animal, with its hide
 and flesh, and with the belly full of all the entrails. And when the flame begins to pour down, then it
 commands that these three things shall be thrown into the middle of it, a stick of cedar, a stick of
 hyssop, and a bunch of saffron; and then, when the fire is wholly extinguished, it commands that
 some man who is clean shall collect the ashes, and shall again place them outside of the city in
 some open place. (269) And what figurative meanings he conceals under these orders as
 symbols, we have accurately explained in another treatise, in which we have discussed the
 allegories. It is necessary, therefore, for those who are about to go into the temple to partake of
 the sacrifice, to be cleansed as to their bodies and as to their souls before their bodies. For the
 soul is the mistress and the queen, and is superior in every thing, as having received a more divine
 nature. And the things which cleanse the mind are wisdom and the doctrines of wisdom, which lead
 to the contemplation of the world and the things in it; and the sacred chorus of the rest of the
 virtues, and honourable and very praiseworthy actions in accordance with the virtues. (270) Let the
 man, therefore, who is adorned with these qualities go forth in cheerful confidence to the temple
 which most nearly belongs to him, the most excellent of all abodes to offer himself as a sacrifice.
 But let him in whom covetousness and a desire of unjust things dwell and display themselves, cover
 his head and be silent, checking his shameless folly and his excessive impudence, in those
 matters in which caution is profitable; for the temple of the truly living God may not be approached
 by unholy sacrifices. (271) I should say to such a man: My good man, God is not pleased even
 though a man bring hecatombs to his altar; for he possesses all things as his own, and stands in
 need of nothing. But he delights in minds which love God, and in men who practise holiness, from
 whom he gladly receives cakes and barley, and the very cheapest things, as if they were the most
 valuable in preference to such as are most costly. (272) And even if they bring nothing else, still
 when they bring themselves, the most perfect completeness of virtue and excellence, they are
 offering the most excellent of all sacrifices, honouring God, their Benefactor and Saviour, with
 hymns and thanksgivings; the former uttered by the organs of the voice, and the latter without the
 agency of the tongue or mouth, the worshippers making their exclamations and invocations with
 their soul alone, and only appreciable by the intellect, and there is but one ear, namely, that of the
 Deity which hears them. For the hearing of men does not extend so far as to be sensible of them.
<p>
 LI. (273) And that this statement is true, and not mine but that of nature, is testified to a certain
 degree by the evident nature of the thing itself, which affords a manifest proof which none can
 deny who do not cleave to credulity out of a contentious disposition. It is testified also by the law
 which commands two altars to be prepared, differing both as to the materials of which they are
 made, as to the places in which they are erected, and as to the purposes to which they are applied;
 (274) for one is made of stones, carefully selected so to fit one another, and unhewn, and it is
 erected in the open air, near the steps of the temple, and it is for the purpose of sacrificing victims
 which contain blood in them. And the other is made of gold, and is erected in the inner part of the
 temple, within the first veil, and may not be seen by any other human being except those of the
 priests who keep themselves pure, and it is for the purpose of offering incense upon; (275) from
 which it is plain that God looks upon even the smallest offering of frankincense by a holy man as
 more valuable than ten thousand beasts which may be sacrificed by one who is not thoroughly
 virtuous. For in proportion, I imagine, as gold is more valuable than stones, and as the things within
 the inner temple are more holy than those without, in the same proportion is the gratitude displayed
 by offerings of incense superior to that displayed by the sacrifice of victims full of blood, (276) on
 which account the altar of incense is honoured not only in the costliness of its materials, and in the
 manner of its erection, and in its situation, but also in the fact that it ministers every day before any
 thing else to the thanksgivings to be paid to God. For the law does not permit the priest to offer the
 sacrifice of the whole burnt offering outside before he has offered incense within at the earliest
 Dawn.{37}{#ex 30:8.} (277) And this command is a symbol of nothing else but of the fact that in the
 eyes of God it is not the number of things sacrificed that is accounted valuable, but the purity of the
 rational spirit of the sacrificer. Unless, indeed, one can suppose that a judge who is anxious to
 pronounce a holy judgment will never receive gifts from any of those whose conduct comes before
 his tribunal, or that, if he does receive such presents, he will be liable to an accusation of
 corruption; and that a good man will not receive gifts from a wicked person, not even though he
 may be poor and the other rich, and he himself perhaps in actual want of what he would so receive;
 and yet that God can be corrupted by bribes, who is most all-sufficient for himself and who has no
 need of any thing created; who, being himself the first and most perfect good thing, the everlasting
 fountain of wisdom, and justice, and of every virtue, rejects the gifts of the wicked. (278) And is not
 the man who would offer such gifts the most shameless of all men, if he offers a portion of the
 things which he has acquired by doing injury, or by rapine, or by false denial, or by robbery, to God
 as if he were a partner in his wickedness? O most miserable of all men! I should say to such a
 man, "You must be expecting one of two things. Either that you will be able to pass undetected, or
 that you will be discovered. (279) Therefore, if you expect to be able to pass undetected, you are
 ignorant of the power of God, by which he at the same time sees everything and hears everything.
 And if you think that you will be discovered, you are most audacious in (when you ought rather to
 endeavour to conceal the wicked actions which you have committed) bringing forward to light
 specimens of all your iniquitous deeds, and giving yourself airs, and dividing the fruits of them with
 God, bringing him unholy first fruits. And have you not considered this, that the law does not admit
 of lawlessness, nor does the light of the sun admit of darkness; but God is the archetypal model of
 all laws, and the sun, which can be appreciated only by the intellect, is the archetypal model of that
 which is visible to the senses, bringing forth from its invisible fountains visible light to afford to him
 who sees." Moreover, there are other commandments relating to the Altar.{38}{yonge's translation
 places sections 280û284 after what is section 345 in the Loeb and makes them part of a new treatise entitled On the
 Commandment that the Wages of a Harlot Are Not To Be Received in the Sacred Treasury. The sections are included
 here in their proper place.} (280) This injunction also is very admirably and properly set down in the
 sacred tablets of the law, that the wages of a harlot are not to be received into the temple, and
 inasmuch as she has earned them by selling her beauty, having chosen a most infamous life for
 the sake of shameful gain; (281) but if the gifts which proceed from a woman who has lived as a
 concubine are unholy, how can those be different which proceed from a soul which is deriled in the
 same manner, which has voluntarily abandoned itself to shame and to the lowest infamy, to
 drunkenness and gluttony, and covetousness and ambition, and love of pleasure, and to
 innumerable other kinds of passions, and diseases, and wickednesses? For what time can be long
 enough to efface those defilements, I indeed do not know. (282) Very often in truth time has put an
 end to the occupation of a harlot, since, when women have outlived their beauty, no one any longer
 approaches them, their prime having withered away like that of some flowers; and what length of
 time can ever transform the harlotry of the soul which from its youth has been trained in early and
 habitual incontinence, so as to bring it over to good order? No time could do this, but God alone, to
 whom all things are possible, even those which among us are impossible. (283) Accordingly, the
 man who is about to offer a sacrifice ought to examine and see, not whether the victim is without
 blemish, but whether his mind is sound, and entire, and perfect. Let him likewise investigate the
 causes for which he is about to offer the sacrifice; for it must be as an expression of thankfulness
 for kindnesses which have been shown to him, or else of supplication for the permanence of his
 present blessings, or for the acquisition of some future good, or else to avert some evil either
 present or expected; for all which objects he should labour to bring his reason into a state of good
 health and sanity; (284) for if he is giving thanks for benefits conferred upon him, he must take
 care not to behave like an ungrateful man, becoming wicked, for the benefits are conferred on a
 virtuous man; or if his object be to secure the permanence of his present prosperity and
 happiness, and to be enabled to look forward to such for the future, he must still show himself
 worthy of his good fortune, and behave virtuously; or if he is asking to escape from evils, let him
 not commit actions deserving of correction and punishment.
<p>
 LII. (285) The law says, "A fire shall be kept burning on the altar which shall never be extinguished,
 but shall be kept burning for Ever."{39}{#le 6:9.} I think with great reason and propriety; for, since
 the graces of God are everlasting, and unceasing, and uninterrupted, which we now enjoy day and
 night, and since the symbol of gratitude is the sacred flame, it is fitting that it should be kindled, and
 that it should remain unextinguished for ever. (286) And, perhaps, the lawgiver designed by this
 command to connect the old with the new sacrifices, and to unite the two by the duration and
 presence of the same fire by which all such sacrifices are consecrated, in order to demonstrate
 the fact that all perfect sacrifices consisted in thanksgiving, although, according to the diversity of
 the occasions on which they are offered, more victims are offered at one time and fewer at
 another. (287) But some are verbal symbols of things appreciable only by the intellect, and the
 mystical meaning which is concealed beneath them must be investigated by those who are eager
 for truth in accordance with the rules of allegory. The altar of God is the grateful soul of the wise
 man, being compounded of perfect numbers undivided and indivisible; for no part of virtue is
 useless. (288) On this soul the sacred fire is continually kept burning, preserved with care and
 unextinguishable. But the light of the mind is wisdom; as, on the contrary, the darkness of the soul
 is folly. For what the light discernible by the outward senses is to the eyes, that is knowledge to
 reason with a view to the contemplation of incorporeal things discernible only by the intellect, the
 light of which is continually shining and never extinguished.
<p>
 LIII. (289) After this the law says, "On every offering you shall add Salt."{40}{#le 2:13.} By which
 injunction, as I have said before, he figuratively implies a duration for ever; for salt is calculated to
 preserve bodies, being placed in the second rank as inferior only to the soul; for as the soul is the
 cause of bodies not being destroyed, so likewise is salt, which keeps them together in the greatest
 degree, and to some extent makes them immortal. (290) On which account the law calls the altar
 thysiasteµrion, giving it a peculiar name of especial honour, from its preserving (diateµreoµ) the
 sacrifices (tas thysias) in a proper manner, and this too though the flesh is consumed by fire; so
 as to afford the most evident proof possible that God looks not upon the victims as forming the real
 sacrifice, but on the mind and willingness of him who offers them, that so the durability and
 firmness of the altar may be ensured by virtue. (291) Moreover, it also ordains that every sacrifice
 shall be offered up without any leaven or honey, not thinking it fit that either of these things should
 be brought to the altar. The honey, perhaps, because the bee which collects it is not a clean
 animal, inasmuch as it derives its birth, as the story goes, from the putrefaction and corruption of
 dead oxen, {41}{this refers to the same idea so beautifully expressed by Virgil, Georgie 4.548 (as it is translated by
 Dryden)--"His mother's precepts he performs with care; / The temple visits and adores with prayer; / Four altars raises;
 from his herd he culls, / For slaughter, four the fairest of his bulls; / Four heifers from his female store he took, / All fair and
 all unknowing of the yoke, / Nine mornings thence with sacrifice and prayers, / The powers atoned, he to the grove repairs.
  / Behold a prodigy! for from within / The broken vowels and the bloated skin, / A buzzing noise of bees his ears alarms: /
 Straight issue through the sides assembling swarms, / Dark as a cloud they make a wheeling flight, / Then on a
 neighbouring tree, descending light: / Like a large cluster of black grapes they show, / And make a large dependance from
 the bough."} just as wasps spring from the bodies of horses. (292) Or else this may be forbidden as
 a figurative declaration that all superfluous pleasure is unholy, making, indeed, the things which are
 eaten sweet to the taste, but inflicting bitter pains difficult to be cured at a subsequent period, by
 which the soul must of necessity be agitated and thrown into confusion, not being able to settle on
 any sure resting place. (293) And leaven is forbidden on account of the rising which it causes; this
 prohibition again having a figurative meaning, intimating that no one who comes to the altar ought
 at all to allow himself to be elated, being puffed up by insolence; but that such persons may keep
 their eyes fixed on the greatness of God, and so obtain a proper conception of the weakness of all
 created beings, even if they be very prosperous; and that so cherishing correct notions they may
 correct the arrogant lofiness of their minds, and discard all treacherous self-conceit. (294) But if
 the Creator and maker of the universe, who has no need of anything which he has created, not
 looking at the exceeding greatness of his own power and at his own authority, but at your
 weakness, gives you a share of his own merciful power, supplying the deficiencies with which you
 are overwhelmed, how do you think it fitting that you should behave towards men who are akin to
 you by nature, and who are springing from the same elements with yourself, when you have
 brought nothing into the world, not even yourself? (295) For, my fine fellow, you came naked into
 the world, and you shall leave it again naked, having received the interval between your birth and
 death as a loan from God; during which what ought you to do rather than take care to live in
 communion and harmony with your fellow creatures, studying equality, and humanity, and virtue,
 repudiating unequal, and unjust, and irreconcilable unsociable wickedness, which makes that
 animal which is by nature the most gentle of all, namely, man, a cruel and untractable monster?
<p>
 LIV. (296) Again, the law commands that candles shall be kept burning from evening until
 Morning{42}{#le 24:2.} on the sacred candlesticks within the veil, on many accounts. One of
 which is that the holy places may be kept illuminated without any interruption after the cessation of
 the light of day, being always kept free from any participation in darkness, just as the stars
 themselves are, for they too, when the sun sets, exhibit their own light, never forsaking the place
 which was originally appointed for them in the world. (297) Secondly, in order that by night, also, a
 rite akin to and closely resembling the sacrifices by day may be performed so as to give pleasures
 to God, and that no time or occasion fit for offering thanksgiving may ever be left out, which is a
 duty most suitable and natural for night; for it is not improper to call the blaze of the most sacred
 light in the innermost shrine itself a sacrifice. (298) The third, which is a reason of the very
 greatest importance, is this. Since we are not only well treated while we are awake, but also when
 we are asleep, inasmuch as the mighty God gives sleep as a great assistance to the human race,
 for the benefit of both their bodies and souls, of their bodies as being by it relieved of the labours
 of the day, and of their souls as being lightened by it of all their cares, and being restored to
 themselves after all the disorder and confusion caused by the outward senses, and as being then
 enabled to retire within and commune with themselves, the law has very properly thought fit to make
 a distinction of the actions of thanksgiving, so that sacrifices may be made on behalf of those who
 are awake by means of the victims which are offered, and on behalf of those who are asleep, and
 of those who are benefited by sleep, by the lighting of the sacred candles.
<p>
 LV. (299) These, then, and other commandments like them, are those which are established for
 the purpose of promoting piety, by express injunctions and prohibitions. But those which are in
 accordance with philosophical suggestions and recommendations must be explained in this
 manner; for the lawgiver, in effect, says, "God, O mind of man! demands nothing of you which is
 either oppressive, or uncertain, or difficult, but only such things as are very simple and easy. (300)
 And these are, to love him as your benefactor; and if you fail to do so, at all events, to fear him as
 your Governor and Lord, and to enter zealously upon all the paths which may please him, and to
 serve him in no careless or superficial manner, but with one's whole soul thoroughly filled as it
 ought to be with God-loving sentiments, and to cleave to his commandments, and to honour justice,
 by all which means the world itself continues constantly in the same nature without ever changing,
 and all other things which are contained in the world have a tendency towards improvement, such
 as the sun and the moon, and the whole multitude of the rest of the stars, and the entire heaven.
 But the mountains of the earth are elevated to the greatest possible height, and the champaign
 country, like other fusible essences, is spread over a body of wide extent, and the sea also
 changes so as to become united with sweet waters, and the rains also become in their turn similar
 to the sea. Therefore every one of those things is still fixed within the same boundaries as those
 within which it was originally created, when it was first disposed of in regular order. But you shall be
 better, living quite irreproachably. (301) And what of all these things is either grievous or laborious?
 You are not compelled to pass over unnavigable seas; or, when tossed about by the billows of the
 middle of winter and the force of contrary winds, to wander about the sea in every direction; or to
 travel on foot over rough and pathless byeways, always being in dread of the haunts of robbers, or
 of the attacks of wild beasts; or to watch all night to protect your walls in the open air, while the
 enemy are lying in ambush for you, and threatening you with the very extremity of danger. Come,
 now, let no unpleasant topics be brought up in pleasant circumstances. We must use words of
 good omen with reference to such advantageous matters. (302) It is only necessary for the mind
 to consent and everything will be ready. Are you not aware that both that heaven which is invisible
 to the outward senses, and that likewise which is appreciable only by the intellect, belongs to God:
 the heaven of heavens as we may call it; and again, that the earth and all that is in it, and the whole
 world, both that which is visible and that which is invisible and incorporeal, being a model of the real
 heaven?
<p>
 LVI. (303) But, nevertheless, he selected out of the whole race of mankind those who were really
 men for their superior excellence; and he elected them and thought them worthy of the highest
 possible honour, calling them to the service of himself, to that everlasting fountain of all that is
 good; from which he has showered forth other virtues, drawing forth, at the same time, for our
 enjoyment, combined with the greatest possible advantage, a drink contributing more than ever
 nectar, or at all events not less, to make those who drink of it immortal. (304) But those men are to
 be pitied, and are altogether miserable, who have never banquetted on the labours of virtue; and
 they have remained to the end the most miserable of all men who have been always ignorant of the
 taste of moral excellence, when it was in their power to have feasted on and luxuriated among
 justice and equality. But these men are uncircumcised in their hearts, as the law expresses it, and
 by reason of the hardness of their hearts they are stubborn, resisting and breaking their traces in a
 restive manner; (305) whom the Lord reproves, saying, "Be ye circumcised as to your
 hard-Heartedness;"{43}{#de 10:16.} that means, "do ye eradicate the overbearing character
 of your dominant part, which the immoderate impulses of the passing hour have sown and caused
 to grow within you, and which the wicked husbandman of the soul, folly, planted. (306) Again, it
 says, "Let not your necks be Stiff,"{44}{#de 10:18.} that is to say, let not your mind be
 unbending and self-willed, and let it not admit into itself that most blameable ignorance of excessive
 perverseness. But discarding obstinacy and moroseness of nature as an enemy, let it change so
 as to become gentle, and inclined to obey the laws of nature. (307) Do you not see that the most
 important and greatest of all the powers of the living God are his beneficent and his punishing
 power? And his beneficent power is called God, since it is by means of this that he made and
 arranged the universe. And the other, or punishing power, is called Lord, on which his sovereignty
 over the universe depends. And God is God, not only of men, but also of gods; and he is mighty,
 being truly strong and truly Powerful.{45}{#de 10:17.}
<p>
 LVII. (308) But, nevertheless, though he is so great in excellence and in power, he feels pity and
 compassion for all those who are most completely sunk in want and distress, not considering it
 beneath his dignity to be the judge in the causes of proselytes, and orphans, and widows, and
 disregarding kings and tyrants, and men in high commands, and honouring the humility of those
 men above mentioned, I mean the proselytes, with precedence, on this account. (309) These men,
 having forsaken their country and their national customs in which they were bred up, which,
 however, were full of the inventions of falsehood and pride, becoming genuine lovers of truth, have
 come over to piety; and becoming in all worthiness suppliants and servants of the true and living
 God, they very properly receive a precedence which they have deserved, having found the reward
 of their fleeing to God in the assistance which they now receive from him. (310) And in the case of
 orphans and widows, since they have been deprived of their natural protectors, the one class
 having lost their parents, and the others their husbands, they have no refuge whatever to which
 they can flee, no aid which they can hope for from man, being utterly destitute; on which account
 they are not deprived of the greatest hope of all, the hope of relief from God, who, because of his
 merciful character, does not refuse to provide and to care for persons so wholly desolate. (311)
 "Let then," says the law, "God alone be thy boast, and thy greater Glory,"{46}{#de 10:21.} And
 do not pride thyself either on thy wealth, or on thy glory, or on the beauty of thy person, or on thy
 strength, or on anything of the same kind as the objects at which foolish empty-headed persons
 are apt to be elated; considering that, in the first place, these things have no connection at all with
 the nature of good, and secondly, that they are liable to rapid changes, fading away in a manner
 before they have time to flourish permanently. (312) And let us cling to the custom of addressing
 our supplications to him, and let us not, after we have subdued our enemies, imitate their impiety in
 those matters of conduct in which they fancy that they are acting piously, burning their sons and
 their daughters to their gods, not, indeed, that it is the custom of all the barbarians to burn their
 children. (313) For they are not become so perfectly savage in their natures as to endure in time
 of peace to treat their nearest and dearest relatives as they would scarcely treat their
 irreconcilable enemies in time of war. But that they do in reality inflame and corrupt the souls of the
 children of whom they are the parents from the very moment that they are out of their swaddling
 clothes; not imprinting on their minds, while they are still tender, any true opinions respecting the
 one only and truly living God. Let us not then be overcome by, and fall down before, and yield to
 their good fortune as if they had prevailed by reason of their piety. (314) For present prosperity is
 given to many persons for a snare, being only a bait to be followed by excessive and incurable
 evils. And it is very likely that even men who are unworthy may be allowed to be successful, not for
 their own sakes, but in order that we who act impiously may be more vehemently grieved and
 pained, who having been born in a God-fearing city, and having been bred up in laws which would
 imbue men with every virtue, and having been instructed from our earliest youth in all such pursuits
 as are most honourable to men, neglect them all, and cling only to such practices as deserve to be
 neglected, considering all good things as subjects for amusement, and looking upon things fit only
 for sport as seriously good.
<p>
 LVIII. (315) And if, indeed, any one assuming the name and appearance of a
 prophet, {47}{#de 13:1.} appearing to be inspired and possessed by the Holy Spirit, were to
 seek to lead the people to the worship of those who are accounted gods in the different cities, it
 would not be fitting for the people to attend to him being deceived by the name of a prophet. For
 such an one is an impostor and not a prophet, since he has been inventing speeches and oracles
 full of falsehood, (316) even though a brother, or a son, or a daughter, or a wife, or a steward, or a
 firm friend, or any one else who seems to be well-intentioned towards one should seek to lead one
 in a similar course; exhorting one to be cheerful among the multitude, and to approach the same
 temples and to adopt the same sacrifices; but such an one should be punished as a public and
 common enemy, and we should think but little of any relationship, and one should relate his
 recommendations to all the lovers of piety, who with all speed and without any delay would hasten
 to inflict punishment on the impious man, judging it a virtuous action to be zealous for his execution.
 (317) For we should acknowledge only one relationship, and one bond of friendship, namely, a
 mutual zeal for the service of God, and a desire to say and do everything that is consistent with
 piety. And these bonds which are called relationships of blood, being derived from one's ancestors,
 and those connections which are derived from intermarriages and from other similar causes, must
 all be renounced, if they do not all hasten to the same end, namely, the honour of God which is the
 one indissoluble bond of all united good will. For such men will lay claim to a more venerable and
 sacred kind of relationship; (318) and the law confirms my assertion, where it says that those who
 do what is pleasing to nature and virtuous are the sons of God, for it says, "Ye are the sons of the
 Lord your God,"{48}{#de 14:1.} inasmuch as you will be thought worthy of his providence and
 care in your behalf as though he were your father. And that care is as much superior to that which
 is shown by a man's own parents, as I imagine the being who takes it is superior to them.
<p>
 LIX. (319) In addition to this the lawgiver also entirely removes out of his sacred code of laws all
 ordinances respecting initiations, and mysteries, and all such trickery and buffoonery; not choosing
 that men who are brought up in such a constitution as that which he was giving should be busied
 about such matters, and, placing their dependence on mystic enchantments, should be led to
 neglect the truth, and to pursue those objects which have very naturally received night and
 darkness for their portion, passing over the things which are worthy of light and of day. Let no one,
 therefore, of the disciples or followers of Moses either be initiated himself into any mysterious rites
 of worship, or initiate any one else; for both the act of learning and that of teaching such initiations
 is an impiety of no slight order. (320) For if these things are virtuous, and honourable, and
 profitable, why do ye, O ye men who are initiated, shut yourselves up in dense darkness, and limit
 your benefits to just three or four men, when you might bring down the advantages which you have
 to bestow into the middle of the market place, and benefit all men; so that every one might without
 hindrance partake of a better and more fortunate life? (321) for envy is never found in conjunction
 with virtue. Let men who do injurious things be put to shame, and seeking hiding places and
 recesses in the earth, and deep darkness, hide themselves, concealing their lawless iniquity from
 sight, so that no one may behold it. But to those who do such things as are for the common
 advantage, let there be freedom of speech, and let them go by day through the middle of the
 market place where they will meet with the most numerous crowds, to display their own manner of
 life in the pure sun, and to do good to the assembled multitudes by means of the principal of the
 outward senses, giving them to see those things the sight of which is most delightful and most
 impressive, and hearing and feasting upon salutary speeches which are accustomed to delight the
 minds even of those men who are not utterly illiterate. (322) Do you not see that nature has
 concealed none of those works which are deservedly celebrated and honourable, but has exhibited
 openly the stars and the whole of heaven, so as to cause the sight pleasure, and to excite a desire
 for philosophy, and she also displays her seas, and fountains, and rivers, and the excellencies of
 the atmosphere, and the beautiful adaptation of the winds to the various seasons of the year, and
 of plants, and of animals, and, moreover, the innumerable species of fruits, for the use and
 enjoyment of men? (323) Would it not have been right, then, for you, following her example and
 design, to give to those who are worthy of it all things that are necessary for their advantage? But
 now it very often happens that no good men at all are initiated by them, but that sometimes robbers,
 and wreckers, and companies of debauched and polluted women are, when they have given money
 enough to those who initiate them, and who reveal to them the mysteries which they call sacred.
 But let all such men be driven away and expelled from that city, and denied all share in that
 constitution, in which honour and truth are reverenced for their own sake. And this is enough to say
 on this subject.
<p>
 LX. (324) But the law, being most especially an interpreter of equal communion, and of courteous
 humanity among men, has preserved the honour and dignity of each virtue; not permitting any one
 who is incurably sunk in vice to flee to them, but rejecting all such persons and repelling them to a
 distance. (325) Therefore, as it was aware that no inconsiderable number of wicked men are often
 mingled in these assemblies, and escape notice by reason of the crowds collected there, in order
 to prevent that from being the case in this instance, he previously excludes all who are unworthy
 from the sacred assembly, beginning in the first instance with those who are afflicted with the
 disease of effeminacy, men-women, who, having adulterated the coinage of nature, are willingly
 driven into the appearance and treatment of licentious women. He also banishes all those who
 have suffered any injury or mutilation in their most important members, and those who, seeking to
 preserve the flower of their beauty so that it may not speedily wither away, have altered the
 impression of their natural manly appearance into the resemblance of a woman. (326) The law
 also excludes not only all harlots, but also those who being born of a harlot bear about them the
 disgrace of their mother, because their original birth and origin have been adulterated. (327) For
 this passage (if there is any passage at all in the whole scripture which does so) admits of an
 allegorical interpretation; for there is not one description only of impious and unholy men, but there
 are many and different. For some persons affirm that the incorporeal ideas are only an empty
 name, having no participation in any real fact, removing the most important of all essences from
 the list of existing things, though it is in fact the archetypal model of all things which are the
 distinctive qualities of essence, in accordance with which each thing is assigned to its proper
 species and limited to its proper dimensions. (328) The sacred pillars of the law call all these men
 broken; for such an injury as is implied by that term leaves a man destitute of all distinctive quality
 and species, and what is so broken is nothing else, to speak the strict truth, than mere shapeless
 material. Thus, the doctrine which takes away species throws every thing into confusion, and
 moreover brings back that want of proper form which existed before the elements were reduced
 into proper order. (329) And what can be more absurd than this? For it is out of that essence that
 God created every thing, without indeed touching it himself, for it was not lawful for the all-wise and
 all-blessed God to touch materials which were all misshapen and confused, but he created them by
 the agency of his incorporeal powers, of which the proper name is "ideas," which he so exerted
 that every genus received its proper form. But this opinion has created great irregularity and
 confusion. For when it takes away the things by means of which the distinctive qualities exist, it at
 the same time takes away the distinctive qualities themselves. (330) But other persons, as if they
 were engaged in a contest of wickedness, being anxious to carry off the prizes of victory, go
 beyond all others in impiety, joining to their denial of the ideas a negative also of the being of God,
 as if he had no real existence but were only spoken of for the sake of what is beneficial to men.
 Others, again, out of fear of that Being who appears to be present everywhere and to see every
 thing, are barren of wisdom, but devoted to the maintenance of that which is the greatest of all
 wickednesses, namely impiety. (331) There is also a third class, who have entered on the contrary
 path, guiding a multitude of men and women, of old and young, filling the world with arguments in
 favour of a multiplicity of rulers, in order by such means to eradicate all notions of the one and truly
 living God from the minds of men. (332) These are they who are symbolically called by the law the
 sons of a harlot. For as mothers who are harlots do not know who is the real father of their
 children, and cannot register him accurately, but have many, or I might almost say all men, their
 lovers and associates, the same is the case with those who are ignorant of the one true God. For,
 inventing a great number whom they falsely call gods, they are blinded as to the most important of
 all existing things which they ought to have thoroughly learnt, if not alone, at all events as the first
 and greatest of all things from their earliest childhood; for what can be a more honourable thing to
 learn than the knowledge of the true and living God?
<p>
 LXI. (333) The law also excludes a fourth class, and a fifth, both hastening to the same end, but not
 with the same intention; for, as they are both followers of the same great evil, self-will, they have
 divided between them the whole soul as a kind of common inheritance, consisting of a rational and
 an irrational part; and the one class has appropriate the rational part, which is the mind, and the
 other the irrational part which is again subdivided into the outward senses; (334) therefore, the
 champions of the mind attribute to it the predominance in and supreme authority over all human
 affairs, and affirm that it is able to preserve all past things in its recollection, and to comprehend all
 present things with great vigour, and to divine the future by probable conjecture; (335) for this is the
 faculty which sowed and planted all the fertile soil in both the mountainous and champaign districts
 of the earth, and which invented agriculture, the most useful of all sciences for human life. This
 also is the faculty which surveyed the heaven, and by a proper contemplation of it made the earth
 accessible to ships by an ingenuity beyond all powers of description; (336) this, also invented
 letters, and music, and the whole range of encyclical instruction, and brought them to perfection.
 This also, is the parent of that greatest of all good things, philosophy, and by means of its different
 parts it has benefited human life, proceeding by the logical portion of it to an infallible interpretation
 of difficulties, and by its moral part to a correction of the manners and dispositions of men; and by
 its physical division to the knowledge of the heaven and the world. And they have also collected
 and assembled many other praises of the mind on which they dwell, having a continual reference to
 the species already mentioned, about which we have not at the present time leisure to occupy
 ourselves.
<p>
 LXII. (337) But the champions of the outward senses extol their praises, also, with great energy
 and magnificence; enumerating in their discourse all the wants which are supplied by their means,
 and they say that two of them are the causes of living; smell and taste; and two of living well, seeing
 and hearing; (338) therefore, by means of taste the nourishment derived from food is conveyed
 into the system, and by means of the nostrils the air on which every living thing depends; for this
 also is a continual food, which nourishes and preserves men, not only while they are awake, but
 also while they are asleep. And the proof of this is clear; for if the passage of the breath be
 obstructed for even the shortest period, to such a degree as wholly to cut off the air which is
 intended by nature to be conveyed into the system from without, inevitable death will of necessity
 ensue. (339) Again, of the more philosophical of the outward senses by means of which the living
 well is produced, the power of sight beholds the light which is the most beautiful of all essences,
 and by means of the light it beholds all other things, the sun, the moon, the stars, the heaven, the
 earth, the sea, the innumerable varieties of plants and animals, and in short all bodies, and shapes,
 and odours, and magnitudes whatever, the sight of which has given birth to excessive wisdom, and
 has begotten a great desire for knowledge. (340) And even without reckoning the advantage
 derived from these things; sight also affords us the greatest benefits in respect of the power of
 distinguishing one's relatives and strangers, and friends, and avoiding what is injurious and
 choosing what is beneficial. Now each of the other parts of the body has been created with
 reference to appropriate uses, which are of great importance, as, for instance, the feet were made
 for walking, and for all the other uses to which the legs can be applied; again, the hands were
 created for the purpose of doing, or giving, or taking anything; and the eyes, as a sort of universal
 good, afford both to the hands and feet, and to all the other parts of the body the cause of being
 able to act or move rightly; (341) and that this is the case is most unerringly demonstrated by the
 evidence of those who have suffered any mutilation in these members, who cannot in real truth be
 said to have either feet or hands, and who by the reality of their condition prove the correctness of
 their name, which they say that men of old gave them not so much by way of reproach as out of
 compassion, calling them impotent, out of surprise at what they see. (342) Again, hearing is the
 thing by which melodies and rhythm, and all parts and divisions of music are distinguished; for song
 and speech are salutary and wholesome medicines, the one charming the passions and the
 inharmonious qualities within us by its rhythm, and our unmelodious qualities by its melodies, and
 bridling our immoderate vehemence by its fixed measures; (343) and each of those parts of it are
 various and multiform, as the musicians and poets do testify, whom we must believe; and speech,
 checking and cutting short all the impulses which lead to wickedness, and healing those who are
 under the dominion of folly and misery, and strengthening those who are inclined to yield in a
 cowardly manner, and subduing those who resist more obstinately, becomes thus the cause of the
 greatest advantages.
<p>
 LXIII. (344) The advocates of the mind and of the outward senses, having put these arguments
 together, make gods of both of them, the one deifying the first, and the other the last; both classes
 out of their self-will and self-conceit forgetting the truly living God. On which account the lawgiver
 very naturally excludes them all from the sacred assembly, calling those who would take away the
 ideas, broken in the stones, and those too who are utterly atheistical, to whom he has given the
 appropriate name of eunuchs; and those who are the teachers of an opposite system of theogony,
 whom he calls the sons of a harlot; and besides all these classes he excludes also the self-willed
 and self-conceited, some of whom have deified reason, and others have called each separate one
 of the outward senses gods. For all these men are hastening to the same end, even though they
 are not all influenced by the same intentions. (345) But we who are the followers and disciples of
 the prophet Moses, will never abandon our investigation into the nature of the true God; looking
 upon the knowledge of him as the true end of happiness; and thinking that the true everlasting life,
 as the law says, {49}{#de 4:4.} is to live in obedience to and worship of God; in which precept it
 gives us a most important and philosophical lesson; for in real truth those who are atheists are
 dead as to their souls, but those who are marshalled in the ranks of the true living God, as his
 servants, enjoy an everlasting Life.{50}{yonge's translation includes a separate treatise title at this point: On the
 Commandment that the Wages of a Harlot Are Not To Be Received in the Sacred Treasury. The first three paragraphs of
 this "treatise" are actually sections 280û284 of The Special Laws, I which have been relocated to their proper positon. The
 remainder of the "treatise" more correctly belongs to On the Sacrifices of Abel and Cain 1.21û33 and have been relocated
 accordingly.}
