 HYPOTHETICA*
<p>
  {**Yonge has a section titled Fragments of Lost Works, which includes what is recognized as Philo's Hypothetica and On
  Providence (Fragments I and II). These fragments appear in Eusebius' Preparation of the Gospel (P.E.). Hypothetica and
  On Providence (Fragments I and II) appear out of sequence in Yonge's edition and have been reordered to conform to the  Cohn-Wendland (Loeb) sequence. Yonge also includes some of Eusebius' prefatory material for On Providence   (Fragments I and II) not included in Loeb.}
<p>
<p>                APOLOGY FOR THE JEWS
<p>
<p>                          From Eusebius, P.E. 8.5.11 ff.
<p>
 (5.11) And first of all I will adduce what Philo says respecting the journey of the Jews into Egypt, of
 which he has given an account, following that which is given by Moses in the first book of the
 Pentateuch, to which he has affixed the superscription, "hypothetically;" where, arguing in behalf of the
 Jews as if he were addressing himself to their accusers, he speaks in the following manner, affirming, --
<p>
 (6.1) That their ancient ancestor, the original founder of their race, was a Chaldaean; and that this
 people emigrated from Egypt, after having in former times left its abode in Syria, being very numerous
 and consisting of countless myriads of people; and that when the land was no longer able to contain
 them, and moreover when a high spirit began to show itself in the dispositions of their young men, and
 when, besides this, God himself by visions and dreams began to show them that he willed that they
 should depart, and when, as the Deity brought it about, nothing was less an object of desire to them
 than their ancient native land; on that account this ancestor of theirs departed and journeyed into
 Egypt, whether in consequence of some express determination of God, or whether it was in consequence
 of some prophetic instinct of his own; so that from that time to the present the nation has had an
 existence and a durability, and has become so exceedingly populous, as it is at this moment. (6.2) And
 then, after a few more sentences, he says, --And they were led in this journey and emigration of theirs by
 a man who, if you will have it so, was in no respect superior to the generality of his fellow countrymen,
 so incessantly did they reproach him as a trickster and one who deceived them with words. An admirable
 amount and kind of trickery and deceit no doubt it was, by which he not only completely saved the whole
 people which was oppressed by want of water and hunger, and by ignorance of the way, and in a
 complete state of destitution of all things, and led them forward as if in all prosperity, and conducted
 them through all the nations lying around, and kept them without any quarrelling with one another,
 and in a state of complete subordination and obedience to himself. (6.3) And this too, not for a short
 time, but for a period of such length, that it is not likely that even a single family would continue in
 perfect unanimity and prosperity for such a time; for no thirst, no hunger, no decay of body, nor fear of
 the future, no ignorance of what was to befall them, ever excited that deceived people, who were being
 led, as some will have it, to their destruction, to rise against him who was deceiving them. Yet what
 would you have us say? (6.4) That he had such excessive art, or such great eloquence of speech, or such
 shrewdness, that he could triumph over so many difficulties of such a nature, which seemed likely to
 lead to the destruction of them all? Surely you must confess, either that the natures of the men under
 him were not utterly ignorant or obstinate, but were obedient and not inclined to neglect a prudent care
 of the future; or else that they were as wicked and perverse as possible, but that God softened their
 obstinacy, and was, as it were, a leader to them in respect both of the present and of the future. For that
 of these alternatives which appears to you to be the truest of the two, appears equally to contribute to
 the praise, and honour, and admiration of the whole nation. (6.5) These things, then, are what I have to
 say about this exodus. But when they came into this land, how they were settled here, and how they got
 possession of the country, they show in their sacred records. And I moreover do not think it necessary to
 describe it as by way of history, but rather to enter into some speculations concerning them as to what
 was their natural and likely course. (6.6) For which of these two alternatives will you embrace? That
 while they were still very numerous, although at last they were evilly afflicted, still, while they were
 powerful and had arms in their hands, they took the country by force, fighting with and defeating both
 the Syrians and Phoenicians who met them in that their land? Or shall we suppose that they were
 unwarlike, and destitute of manly courage, and altogether deficient in point of numbers, and destitute of
 any supplies for war; but that they met with respectful treatment from those nations, and obtained their
 land from them, who willingly surrendered it to them? and that then immediately, or at no distant
 period, they built a temple, and did everything else which has any bearing on religion and piety? (6.7)
 For these circumstances, as it seems, would prove them to have been a God-loving people, and beloved
 by God, and confessed to be such even by their enemies; for those people into whose territories they had
 suddenly come, as if to deprive them of them, were of necessity their enemies. (6.8) And if they met with
 respectful treatment and honour from them, how can we deny that they surpassed all other men in good
 fortune? And what shall we say after this in the second place, or in the third place? Shall we speak of
 their admirable code of laws, of their obedience, or of their devotion, and justice, and holiness, and
 piety? But in truth they looked upon that man, whoever he was, who gave them these laws, with such
 excessive admiration and veneration, that whatever he approved of they immediately thought best also.
 (6.9) Therefore, whether he spoke, being influenced by his own reason, or because he was inspired by the
 Deity, they referred every word of his to God. And though many years have passed, I cannot tell the
 exact number, but more than two thousand, still they have never altered one word of what was written
 by him, but would rather endure to die ten thousand times than to do any thing in opposition to his laws
 and to the customs which he established. (6.10) After Philo has said this, he proceeds to give an
 abridgment of the constitution established in the nation of the Jews by the laws of Moses, speaking
 thus:--
<p>
 (7.1) Now, is there anything among that people resembling these circumstances, anything which
 appears to be of a mild and gentle character, and which admits of invocations of justice, and pleas, and
 delays, and of assessments of damages, and on the other hand of counter assessments? Not a word, but
 every thing is simple, plain, and straightforward. If you indulge in illicit connexions, if you commit
 adultery, if you do violence to a child (for do not speak of doing so to a boy, but even to a female child);
 and in like manner, if you prostitute yourself, if you suffer any thing disgraceful contrary to what
 becomes your age, or appear to do so, or are about to do so, death is the penalty for such wickedness.
 (7.2) Again, if you behave with insult towards a slave, or towards a free person, if you confine such an
 one in bonds, if you lead him away and sell him, if you steal any thing, whether common or sacred, if
 you commit acts of impiety, not only by your deeds but even by any chance word, I will not venture to
 say against God himself (may God be merciful to us, and of the same opinion about these matters), but
 against your father, or your mother, or your benefactor, death is equally the penalty. And that too, not
 a common, or ordinary, or natural death; but he who has merely uttered a single impious word must be
 stoned, as having committed no inferior impiety. (7.3) He also gives many other injunctions, such as
 these, that wives shall serve their husbands, not indeed in any particular so as to be insulted by them,
 but in the spirit of reasonable obedience in all things; that parents shall govern their children for their
 preservation and benefit; that every one shall be the lord of his own possessions, provided he has not
 dedicated them to God, nor spoken of God as their owner; but if he has vowed them only by a single
 word, then it is not lawful for him to lay hands upon or to touch them, but he must at once separate
 himself from them all. (7.4) May I never be guilty of plundering the things which belong to God, or of
 stealing what has been offered and dedicated to him by others. And even, as I have said before, if a
 single word to that effect has unintentionally fallen from a man, he must, instead of taking away from
 what is already dedicated, add some offering of his own; for if he has said the word, he, by so speaking,
 deprives himself of every thing. But if he repents, or wishes to recall and amend what he has said, he
 shall be deprived also of his very life. (7.5) And the same principle extends to other things, of which he is
 the owner. If a man by any words dedicates that which is requisite to support a wife, she shall be sacred
 and entitled to receive the support. If a father makes such a promise to his son, or a master to his
 servant, the rule is the same. And the way in which a man may be released from any promise or vow
 which he has made in such a manner can only be in the most perfect and complete way, when the high
 priest discharges him from it; for he is the person entitled to receive it in due subordination to God. And
 the next way is that which consists in propitiating the mercy of God in behalf of those who are the more
 immediate owners of the thing vowed, so that he may not accept of what is thus dedicated, since it is
 necessary to them. (7.6) There are, besides these rules, ten thousand other precepts, which refer to the
 unwritten customs and ordinances of the nation. Moreover, it is ordained in the laws themselves that no
 one shall do to his neighbour what he would be unwilling to have done to himself. That a man shall not
 take up what he has not put down, neither out of a garden, nor out of a wine-press, nor out of a
 threshing-floor; and that absolutely no one shall take anything, whether it be great or small, out of a
 heap. That no one shall refuse fire to one who begs it of him. That no one shall cut off a stream of
 water, but that everyone shall contribute food to beggars and cripples, and that such shall have favour
 with God. (7.7) That no one shall keep any one from performing funeral honours to the dead, but shall
 even throw upon them so much earth as if sufficient to protect them from impiety: that no one shall
 violate or move, in any manner or degree whatever, the graves, or tombs, or memorials of those who are
 dead. That no one shall add bonds, or any evil, or heap any additional suffering on him who is in
 trouble. That no one shall eradicate the generative powers of a man. That no one shall cause the
 offspring of women to be abortive by means of miscarriage, or by any other contrivance. That no one
 shall treat animals, in any respect, in a manner contrary to the injunctions imposed, whether by God or
 by a lawgiver. That no one shall cause his seed to disappear. That no one shall enslave his offspring.
 (7.8) That no one shall apply a false balance, or an inadequate measure, or bad money. That no one
 shall tell the secrets of his friends in a foreign land. Where, in God's name, are these yokes of oxen of
 ours gone? And look also at other commandments besides these. It is ordained, that no one shall fix the
 residence of the parents apart from that of the children, not even if they are prisoners of war; nor that of
 a wife from that of her husband, even though a man may be her master, having purchased her lawfully.
 (7.9) These commandments now are of a more solemn and important character, but there are others of
 apparently a trivial and ordinary kind. It is not lawful, says the lawgiver, to strip a nest wholly of its
 young; it is not lawful to reject the supplication of animals of any kind whatever, which flee to you for
 refuge, not even if any of them are very insignificant. You may say, perhaps, that these things are of no
 consequence whatever, but still, at least, the law which speaks of these particulars is of importance, and
 deserving of all imaginable care and attention; and the declarations are important, and so are the
 curses which threaten those who violate these laws with destruction; and God looks over all such
 matters, and is an avenger and punisher on every occasion and in every place. (7.10) And then after a
 few more sentences he adds, --And if it should happen that during a whole day, or I should rather say,
 not one day only but many, and those too not coming immediately one after another, but with intervals
 between them, even intervals of a week at a time, the custom, as is always natural, which is drawn from
 ordinary days prevails. Do you not wonder, that not a single one of all these commandments has been
 violated? (7.11) Is not this a mark of great temperance and self-restraint, derived to them from practice
 alone, so that they act towards one another with perfect equality, and are able to derive strength from
 those actions if it be necessary? Surely not so; but the lawgiver thought that it ought to be derived from
 some great and admirable circumstance, that they should not only be competent to do other things in
 the same manner, but should also be imbued with a thorough knowledge of their national laws and
 customs. (7.12) What then did he do on this sabbath day? he commanded all the people to assemble
 together in the same place, and sitting down with one another, to listen to the laws with order and
 reverence, in order that no one should be ignorant of anything that is contained in them; (7.13) and, in
 fact, they do constantly assemble together, and they do sit down one with another, the multitude in
 general in silence, except when it is customary to say any words of good omen, by way of assent to what
 is being read. And then some priest who is present, or some one of the elders, reads the sacred laws to
 them, and interprets each of them separately till eventide; and then when separate they depart, having
 gained some skill in the sacred laws, and having made great advancers towards piety. (7.14) Do not
 these objects appear to you to be of greater importance than any other pursuit can possibly be?
 Therefore they do not go to interpreters of laws to learn what they ought to do; and even without
 asking, they are in no ignorance respecting the laws, so as to be likely, through following their own
 inclinations, to do wrong; but if you violate or alter any one of the laws, or if you ask any one of them
 about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty; and the
 husband appears to be a master, endowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a
 father to teach them to his children, and a master to his servants. (7.15) And again, it is easy to speak in
 the same manner with respect to the seventh year, though, perhaps, one is not to say exactly the same
 things, for they do not abstain from all work as they do on the sabbath days, only they leave their land
 fallow till the next year, in order that so it may become productive; for they think that thus it becomes
 much better after having had this rest, and then that it may be cultivated again, and not be dried up
 and exhausted by the uninterrupted continuance of cultivation; (7.16) and you may see that a similar
 practice conduces to strength of body, for not only do intervals of relaxation contribute to health, but
 you may see too that physicians also enjoin a degree of rest at times from work; for what is incessant,
 and uninterrupted, and always the same, is likely to be injurious, especially in the case of hard work, the
 cultivation of the land. (7.17) And a proof of this is, that if any one were to recommend the people to
 cultivate the land itself much more, and to add this seventh year also, and should promise them that the
 usual crops of fruit should reward their labours, they still would not adopt his advice, for they think
 that they are not alone entitled to rest from their labours, and yet even if they were to do so, it would be
 nothing strange; but they think that their land also deserves a certain degree of rest and exemption, in
 order again to receive a fresh beginning of care and cultivation; (7.18) since, in God's name, what
 could hinder them from letting it out during the year of jubilee thus proposed, and then receiving its
 annual produce once a year from those who rented and cultivated it? But as I said before, they will not
 admit of any such expedient in any manner or degree whatever, out of care, as it seems to me, for the
 welfare of the land; (7.19) and this is truly a very great proof of their humanity and moderation. For,
 since they themselves rest from their labours during that year, they think that it is not right either to
 collect the fruits or crops which are produced, nor to lay up any thing which has not accrued to them
 from their own labours; but, as if God provided for them while the land is thus enjoying rest and
 regulating itself according to its will, they think that any one who chooses or who is in want, any
 traveller or stranger, may gather the fruit that year with impunity. (7.20) However, this is enough to say
 to you on these matters; for, as to the fact of this law existing among them with regard to the seventh
 day and seventh year, you will not inquire of me, as you have perhaps heard it often from many persons,
 both physicians, and investigators of natural history, and philosophers, who discuss this law about the
 seventh year, as to the effect which it has on the nature of the universe, and especially on the nature of
 man. This is what he says about the seventh day ... I shall be contented with the testimony of Philo on
 the present occasion, which he has given about the matter which I am here explaining in many passages
 of his treatises. And now do you take that work which he has written in defence of the Jewish nation, and
 read the following sentences in it.
<p>
 (11.1) But our lawgiver trained an innumerable body of his pupils to partake in those things, who are
 called Essenes, being, as I imagine, honoured with this appellation because of their exceeding holiness.
 And they dwell in many cities of Judaea, and in many villages, and in great and populous communities.
 (11.2) And this sect of them is not an hereditary of family connexion; for family ties are not spoken of
 with reference to acts voluntarily performed; but it is adopted because of their admiration for virtue and
 love of gentleness and humanity. (11.3) At all events, there are no children among the Essenes, no, nor
 any youths or persons only just entering upon manhood; since the dispositions of all such persons are
 unstable and liable to change, from the imperfections incident to their age, but they are all full-grown
 men, and even already declining towards old age, such as are no longer carried away by the
 impetuosity of their bodily passions, and are not under the influence of the appetites, but such as enjoy
 a genuine freedom, the only true and real liberty. (11.4) And a proof of this is to be found in their life of
 perfect freedom; no one among them ventures at all to acquire any property whatever of his own,
 neither house, nor slave, nor farm, nor flocks and herds, nor any thing of any sort which can be looked
 upon as the fountain or provision of riches; but they bring them together into the middle as a common
 stock, and enjoy one common general benefit from it all. (11.5) And they all dwell in the same place,
 making clubs, and societies, and combinations, and unions with one another, and doing every thing
 throughout their whole lives with reference to the general advantage; (11.6) but the different members
 of this body have different employments in which they occupy themselves, and labour without hesitation
 and without cessation, making no mention of either cold, or heat, or any changes of weather or
 temperature as an excuse for desisting from their tasks. But before the sun rises they betake themselves
 to their daily work, and they do not quit it till some time after it has set, when they return home rejoicing
 no less than those who have been exercising themselves in gymnastic contests; (11.7) for they imagine
 that whatever they devote themselves to as a practice is a sort of gymnastic exercise of more advantage
 to life, and more pleasant both to soul and body, and of more enduring benefit and equability, than
 mere athletic labours, inasmuch as such toil does not cease to be practised with delight when the age of
 vigour of body is passed; (11.8) for there are some of them who are devoted to the practice of
 agriculture, being skilful in such things as pertain to the sowing and cultivation of lands; others again
 are shepherds, or cowherds, and experienced in the management of every kind of animal; some are
 cunning in what relates to swarms of bees; (11.9) others again are artisans and handicraftsmen, in
 order to guard against suffering from the want of anything of which there is at times an actual need;
 and these men omit and delay nothing, which is requisite for the innocent supply of the necessaries of
 life. (11.10) Accordingly, each of these men, who differ so widely in their respective employments, when
 they have received their wages give them up to one person who is appointed as the universal steward
 and general manager; and he, when he has received the money, immediately goes and purchases what is
 necessary and furnishes them with food in abundance, and all other things of which the life of mankind
 stands in need. (11.11) And those who live together and eat at the same table are day after day
 contented with the same things, being lovers of frugality and moderation, and averse to all
 sumptuousness and extravagance as a disease of both mind and body. (11.12) And not only are their
 tables in common but also their dress; for in the winter there are thick cloaks found, and in the summer
 light cheap mantles, so that whoever wants one is at liberty without restraint to go and take whichever
 kind he chooses; since what belongs to one belongs to all, and on the other hand whatever belongs to
 the whole body belongs to each individual. (11.13) And again, if any one of them is sick he is cured from
 the common resources, being attended to by the general care and anxiety of the whole body.
 Accordingly the old men, even if they happen to be childless, as if they were not only the fathers of many
 children but were even also particularly happy in an affectionate offspring, are accustomed to end their
 lives in a most happy and prosperous and carefully attended old age, being looked upon by such a
 number of people as worthy of so much honour and provident regard that they think themselves bound
 to care for them even more from inclination than from any tie of natural affection. (11.14) Again,
 perceiving with more than ordinary acuteness and accuracy, what is alone or at least above all other
 things calculated to dissolve such associations, they repudiate marriage; and at the same time they
 practise continence in an eminent degree; for no one of the Essenes ever marries a wife, because woman
 is a selfish creature and one addicted to jealousy in an immoderate degree, and terribly calculated to
 agitate and overturn the natural inclinations of a man, and to mislead him by her continual tricks;
 (11.15) for as she is always studying deceitful speeches and all other kinds of hypocrisy, like an actress
 on the stage, when she is alluring the eyes and ears of her husband, she proceeds to cajole his
 predominant mind after the servants have been deceived. (11.16) And again, if there are children she
 becomes full of pride and all kinds of license in her speech, and all the obscure sayings which she
 previously meditated in irony in a disguised manner she now begins to utter with audacious confidence;
 and becoming utterly shameless she proceeds to acts of violence, and does numbers of actions of which
 every one is hostile to such associations; (11.17) for the man who is bound under the influence of the
 charms of a woman, or of children, by the necessary ties of nature, being overwhelmed by the impulses
 of affection, is no longer the same person towards others, but is entirely changed, having, without being
 aware of it, become a slave instead of a free man. (11.18) This now is the enviable system of life of these
 Essenes, so that not only private individuals but even mighty kings, admiring the men, venerate their
 sect, and increase their dignity and majesty in a still higher degree by their approbation and by the
 honours which they confer on them.
