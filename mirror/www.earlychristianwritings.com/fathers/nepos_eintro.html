<p align="center"><b>Cornelius Nepos: Lives of Eminent Commanders (1886).&nbsp;
Preface to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p><u>Life of Cornelius Nepos</u></p>

<p>Nepos lived in the first century BC.&nbsp; Pliny the Elder twice refers to
him as dying in the principate of Augustus (<i>Natural History,</i> ix.137;
x.60), and he seems to have lived from around 99BC to around 24BC.&nbsp; We know
from his own words that he outlived Atticus, who died in 32 BC, and that he
lived to an advanced age.</p>

<p>The <i>praenomen</i> of Cornelius Nepos is unknown.&nbsp; Pliny the Elder
speaks of him as <i>Padi accola</i> (<i>NH</i>. iii.127), and we know that he
was born in that part of Cisalpine Gaul which took its name from the Insubres
(Pliny the Younger, <i>Letters.</i> iv.28.1; cf. Cicero, <i>Letters ad fam.</i>
xv.16.1).&nbsp; It has been inferred from this that he most likely was born in
ancient Ticinum, today known as Pavia.</p>

<p>He lived in Rome, but we learn from Pliny the Younger that he was not of
senatorial rank (<i>Lett.</i> v.3.6).&nbsp; He exchanged letters with Cicero
(Macrobius, <i>Saturnalia</i> ii.1.14; Suetonius <i>Julius</i> 55; etc).&nbsp;
Catullus dedicated a book of poems to him (Catullus 1).&nbsp; In his
correspondence, Fronto suggests that, like Atticus, Nepos was a publisher as
well as a writer (i. p.169, Loeb).</p>

<p><u>Works</u></p>

<p>Nepos wrote a considerable amount, but little has come down to us.&nbsp; The
following items are known to us from references in other writers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Love Poems</i>.&nbsp; Mentioned by Pliny the Younger (<i>Lett.</i>
    v.3.6).</li>
  <li><i>Chronica</i>.&nbsp; Referred to by Catullus in his dedication.&nbsp; In
    three books.&nbsp; It gave an outline of world history from earliest times
    down to about 54 BC.&nbsp; Like the Atticus' <i>Liber Annalis</i> (Nepos,
    xxiii.13.1), it was a chronology.</li>
  <li><i>Exempla</i>.&nbsp; Mentioned by Aulus Gellius, who refers to its 5th
    book (<i>Attic Nights</i>, vi.18.11).&nbsp; An anthology of anecdotes,
    intended for use by orators.&nbsp; According to Rolfe, it must have been
    issued after 43 BC, as Suetonius says Nepos refers to the seige of Mutina in
    describing Augustus' drinking habits (Suetonius, <i>Augustus</i> 77).&nbsp;
    However it seems unclear whether this reference must refer to this
    particular work.</li>
  <li><i>Life of Cato</i>.&nbsp; Mentioned by Nepos himself (xxiv. 3.5)</li>
  <li><i>Life of Cicero</i>. Mentioned by Aulus Gellius (<i>Attic Nights</i>,
    xv.28.2), apparently composed after the death of the orator.</li>
  <li><i>A treatise on Geography</i>.&nbsp; The title is unknown, but the work
    is referred to by Pliny the Elder, who speaks of it as uncritical (v.4), and
    Pomponius Mela.</li>
  <li><i>De viris illustribus</i>.&nbsp; This was in at least 16 books, as
    Charisius cites the 16th book (i.141.13 K).&nbsp; It contained biographies,
    in groups of two books.&nbsp; The first book contained a set of famous men
    of various nations; the partner book then had Romans distinguished in the
    same field.&nbsp; This means at least 8 categories were present.&nbsp; From
    Nepos and others (Nepos x.3.2; xxi.1.1; xxiii.13.4; Suetonius <i>vit. Ter</i>.
    iii, p.457 Loeb) we learn of the categories of generals, historians, kings
    and poets.&nbsp; Gellius gives a reference to book 12, with reference to a
    Roman historian (xi.8.5), which is confusing: either there is an error in
    Gellius, or else an extra book of introductory matter preceded each pair of
    books of lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our text is an extract of <i>De viris illustribus</i>.&nbsp; We have the
entire book <i>De excellentibus ducibus exterarum gentium</i> -- on foreign
generals -- plus two lives from <i>De Historicis Latinis</i>.&nbsp; There are
also some fragments.</p>

<p>In the past, <i>De excellentibus ducibus</i> was attributed to Aemilius
Probus, a grammarian of the period of Theodosius II (AD 408-450), since an
epigram of his appears in some of the manuscripts, after the life of Hannibal,
and followed in A and P by an explicit &quot;Aemilii Probi de excellentibus
ducibus exterarum gentium liber explicit.&quot;&nbsp; However, various passages
indicate the author lived at the end of the Republic and start of the Principate
(e.g. xviii.8.2; xvii.4.2; viii.2.4), and the resemblances in language and style
to the other two lives, which come down to us under the name of Cornelius Nepos,
are so substantial as to leave no doubt that they share the same author.&nbsp;
Probus seems to have been the author of a collection of selected lives from
Nepos.</p>

<p>The work was published before Atticus died, ca. 35 or 34 BC.&nbsp; A second
edition appeared before 27 BC with additional material in the life of
Atticus.&nbsp; The date is given by the fact that Augustus is everywhere
referred to as Caesar, not under the title of Augustus conferred in 27BC.</p>

<p>According to his own statement (xvi.1.1) Nepos wrote biography, not
history.&nbsp; The lives were addressed to the general public (praef.1-7;
xv.1.1).&nbsp; There are obvious links of genre to the parallel lives of
Plutarch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Manuscripts</u></p>

<p>After late antiquity, knowledge of Nepos disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; However a
single manuscript of Nepos seems to have survived the middle ages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Dan</i>. or <i>Gif</i>.&nbsp; (Lost) Formerly at St. Benoît-sur-Loire,
    it belonged in the 16th century to Pierre Daniel or (more probably)
    Gifanius.&nbsp; It is referred to as <i>Dan.</i> or <i>Gif.</i> in the
    literature, and some of its readings can be recovered from several printed
    editions in the 16th and 17th century, and also some manuscript notes about
    it by Paul Petau.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two direct copies of it were made:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>L</b>. ---- Leiden, B.P.L. 2011.&nbsp; This was written in the third
    quarter of the fifteenth century, in the Netherlands/Rhine region.&nbsp; It
    does not contain the Life of Cato, or the Cornelia fragments.</li>
  <li><b>P</b>. ---- The <i>codex Parcensis</i>.&nbsp; (Lost) This came from the
    library of le Parc in Belgium.&nbsp; It was transferred to Louvain, and
    destroyed in WW1 in the bombardment in August 1914.&nbsp; Various detailed
    collations survive, notably one by K.L.Roth preserved in the University
    Library at Basle.&nbsp; Manuscript librarians are as a rule obstructive of
    photography, but a photograph of one page was made and appears in Chatelain,
    <i>Paleographie de classiques latins</i>, vol. ii, plate CLXXXII.&nbsp; It
    is written in a Flemish hand of the second half of the 15th century.&nbsp;
    This copy did not contain the life of Atticus or Cornelia fragments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further manuscripts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>A</b>. ---- Wolfenbüttel, Gudianus latinus 166 (= the <i>codex
    Guelferbytanus Gudianus</i> 166).&nbsp; This was written at the very end of
    the 12th centur, perhaps in Northern France.&nbsp; It is also descended from
    <i>Dan.</i>, but less directly than L or P.&nbsp; The text is markedly
    inferior to the agreement of L and P, although its&nbsp; value for the Lives
    of Cato, Atticus, and the Cornelia fragments is considerable.&nbsp; A
    photograph of a portion of the text is in Chatelain.</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of late copies exist, of which these are a few, listed in the
Loeb.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>B</b>. ---- San Gallensis.&nbsp; 14th century.</li>
  <li><b>M</b>. ---- Monacensis.&nbsp; Written at Ulm in 1482.</li>
  <li><b>R</b>. ----&nbsp; Codex Collegii Romani. 13th century.</li>
  <li><b>H</b>. ---- Codex Haenelianus.&nbsp; Written in 1469.</li>
  <li><b>Can</b>. ---- Codex Bodleianus Canonici Lat. 159.&nbsp; 15th century.</li>
  <li><b>Leid</b>. ---- Another Leiden Ms.</li>
  <li><b>V</b>. ---- Codex Vindobonensis.&nbsp; 15th century</li>
  <li><b>&Sigma;</b>. ---- Codex Strozzianus (Florence).</li>
  <li><b>F</b>. ---- Codex Claromontanus 259.&nbsp; 15th century.</li>
  <li><b>&theta;</b>. ---- Codex Parisinus Lat. 5826.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>&mu;</b>. ---- Codex Parisinus Lat. 6143.</li>
  <li><b>&lambda;</b>. ---- Codex Parisinus Lat. 5837</li>
  <li><b>&pi;</b>. ---- Codex Parisinus (Arsenal library)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Utrecht edition of 1542 also has independent value.</p>

<p>All the existing codices have the same lacuna at vi.2.3, and a number of
obvious errors in common, and so are all descended from a single
manuscript.&nbsp; This is assumed to be a minuscule, not earlier than the
eleventh century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Note</u></p>

<p>This translation of Nepos was found in the same volume as Eutropius and
Justin, and has been added to the collection for completeness.&nbsp; However the
Bohn text did not include a translation of the fragments.&nbsp; I have obtained
the Latin text in the Loeb edition, and created a public domain English
translation.</p>
