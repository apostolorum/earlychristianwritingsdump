<p>HAMLET. Edited by EDWARD DOWDEN. <i>Demy 8vo. </i>3<i>s</i>. <i>6d.</i></p>
<h3 align="center">History and Biography</h3>
<p>THE LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. Arranged and Edited with Notes by
SIDNEY COLVIN. <i>Demy </i>8<i>vo. 2 vols. </i>25<i>s</i>. <i>net.</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>These highly important and interesting volumes contain the correspondence
  of Robert Louis Stevenson from his eighteenth year to almost the last day of
  his life, selected and edited, with notes and introductions, by Mr. Sidney
  Colvin, his most intimate friend. The letters are very various in subject and
  character, being addressed partly to his family and private friends, and
  partly to such well known living or lately deceased men of letters as Mr.
  Hamerton, Mr. J. A. Symonds, Mr. Henry James, Mr. James Payn, Dr. Conan Doyle,
  Mr. J. M. Barrie, Mr. Edmund Gosse, Mr. F. Locker-Lampson, Mr. Cosmo
  Monkhouse, Mr. Andrew Lang, Mr. W. E. Henley, and the Editor himself. They
  present a vivid and brilliant autobiographical picture of the mind and
  character of the distinguished author. It was originally intended that a
  separate volume containing a full narrative and critical Life by the Editor
  should appear simultaneously with the letters, and form part of the work: but
  the publication of this has for various reasons been postponed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF SIR JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS, President of the Royal
Academy. By his Son, J. G. MILLAIS. With nearly 300 Illustrations, of which 9
are in photogravure. <i>Two volumes. Royal 8vo. </i>32<i>s</i>. <i>net.</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An edition limited to 350 copies will also be printed. This will contain 22
  of Millais' great paintings reproduced in photogravure, with a case containing
  an extra set of these Photogravures pulled on India paper. The price of this
  edition will be £4, 4<i>s. net.</i></p>
  <p>In these two magnificent volumes is contained the authoritative biography
  of the most distinguished and popular painter of the last half of the century.
  They contain the story of his extraordinary boyhood, of his early struggles
  and triumphs, of the founding of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, now first
  given to the world in authentic detail, of the painting of most of his famous
  pictures, of his friendships with many of the most distinguished men of the
  day in art, letters, and politics, of his home life, and of his sporting
  tastes. There are a large <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> number of
  letters to his wife describing the circumstances under which his pictures were
  painted, letters from Her Majesty the Queen, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr. Gladstone,
  Mr. Watts, Sir William Harcourt, Lord Rosebery, Lord Leighton, etc., etc.
  Among them are several illustrated letters from Landseer, Leech, Du Maurier,
  and Mike Halliday. The last letter that Lord Beacons-field wrote before his
  death is reproduced in fac-simile. Mr. Val Prinsep contributes his
  reminiscences of Millais in a long and most interesting chapter. Not the least
  attractive and remarkable feature of this book will be the magnificence of its
  illustrations. No more complete representation of the art of any painter has
  ever been produced on the same scale. The owners of Sir John Millais'<sup> </sup>most
  famous pictures and their copyrights have generously given their consent to
  their reproduction in his biography, and, in addition to those pictures with
  which the public is familiar, over two hundred pictures and sketches which
  have never been reproduced before, and which, in all probability, will never
  be seen again by the general public, will appear in these pages. The early
  chapters contain sketches made by Millais at the age of seven. There follow
  some exquisite drawings made by him during his Pre-Raphaelite period, a large
  number of sketches and studies made for his great pictures, water colour
  sketches, pen-and-ink sketches, and drawings, humorous and serious. There are
  ten portraits of Millais himself, including two by Mr. Watts and Sir Edward
  Burne Jones. There is a portrait of Dickens, taken after death, and a sketch
  of D. G. Rossetti. Thus the book will be not only a biography of high interest
  and an important contribution to the history of English art, but in the best
  sense of the word, a beautiful picture book.</p>

<p>Messrs. METHUEN have in preparation an edition of those novels of Charles
&quot;Dickens which have now passed out of copyright. Mr. George Gissing, whose
critical study of Dickens is both sympathetic and acute, has written an
Introduction to each of the books, and a very attractive feature of this edition
will be the illustrations of the old houses, inns, and buildings, which Dickens
described, and which have now in many instances disappeared under the touch of
modern civilisation. Another valuable feature will be a series of topographical
and general notes to each book by Mr. F. G. Kitton. The books will be produced
with the greatest care as to printing, paper and binding.</p>
<p>The first volumes will be :</p>
<p>THE PICKWICK PAPERS. With Illustrations by E. H. NEW. <i>Two Volumes.</i></p>
<p>NICHOLAS NICKLEBY. With Illustrations by R. J. WILLIAMS. <i>Two Volumes.</i></p>

<p>Messrs. METHUEN intend to produce a series of small books under the above
title, containing some of the famous books in English and other literatures, in
the domains of fiction, poetry, and belles lettres. The series will also contain
several volumes of selections in prose and verse.</p>
<p>The books will be edited with the most sympathetic and scholarly care. Each
one will contain an Introduction which will give (1) a short biography of the
author, (2) a critical estimate of the book. Where they are necessary, short
notes will be added at the foot of the page.</p>
<p>The Little Library will ultimately contain complete sets of the novels of W.
M. Thackeray, Jane Austen, the sisters Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and others. It will
also contain the best work of many other novelists whose names are household
words.</p>
