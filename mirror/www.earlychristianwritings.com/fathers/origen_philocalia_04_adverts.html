special interest of being the production of the very period when the great
transition in the Church's fortunes, from Imperial persecution to Imperial
favour, was leading to the inevitable transformation of her buildings and her
services to suit her altered circumstances. . . . The <i>Testament </i>reflects
this state of things as a mirror. It vibrates, moreover, with the pulsation of
the great controversies through which the Church was passing. The volume is thus
far more than a mere antiquarian curiosity. It had a message to its own time; it
has a message to all time, and very distinctly to the time now present. The <i>Testament
</i>is also a veritable mine at once of devotional expression and liturgical
lore.</font></p>

Messrs. Clark in what is, we think, the boldest and most enterprising venture in
religious literature which has ever been undertaken in this country. We wish
them all the success they deserve, and that success should be very great. The
services of Dr. Hastings and his loyal colleague Dr. Selbie demand an
