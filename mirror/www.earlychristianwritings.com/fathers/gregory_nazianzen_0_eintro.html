<p align="center"><b>Julian the Emperor (1888).&nbsp; Preface to the online
edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">Gregory Nazianzen wrote 40 orations, of which a selection is
already available online in the Ante-Nicene, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers
collection.&nbsp; Not among them were two further orations, nos. 4 and 5, which are
the first and second invectives against
Julian the Apostate.&nbsp; Quasten's <i>Patrology</i>, vol. 3 p.242 reports that
they were probably never delivered in public; and that the tone is so angry and
hostile that their historical value is almost zero.&nbsp; The last point,
however, is probably an over-statement.</p>

<p align="left">The English translations are those of C.W.King, published in
1888 as the first two works in a volume entitled, &quot;Julian the Emperor&quot;
and published by George Bell &amp; co, London in the Bohn's Library
series.&nbsp; The volume also included the funeral oration delivered by the
pagan Libanius, and two pagan works&nbsp; by Julian himself.&nbsp; After some
hesitation, these have been included, and placed in the appendix because of
their historical interest.&nbsp; The whole volume is thus online, including the
advertisements, but the plan of this collection has meant some dispersal of the
material not by Gregory himself.</p>

<p align="left">Reading the translator's preface and notes, the reader will
quickly discover that C.W. King was an enthusiastic partisan of Julian.&nbsp; It
is unusual for a translator to detest the author or the work he is translating,
but the notes by Mr. King leave little doubt that he did so detest these orations of
Gregory.&nbsp; The majority of the notes contain the translator's opinion of the
sentiments expressed, rather than explanation of historical obscurities.&nbsp;
In fact, they seem to form a running rejoinder, in which Gregory is repeatedly
described as a liar or hypocrite.&nbsp; But the reader will recall that a
'vituperation' or 'invective' is a literary form, as Quintilian indicates and as
the Philippics of Cicero remind us, and it is useless to complain that Gregory
does not give a fair picture when he did not set out to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; After
some hesitation, I have reproduced the footnotes anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">This is not the place to write an evaluation of Julian the
Apostate.&nbsp; Julian has been well-served by his apologists and panegyricists,
such as Libanius, and even today is regarded much more positively than any other
member of his dynasty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory reminds us of the darker side of this controversial
reign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
