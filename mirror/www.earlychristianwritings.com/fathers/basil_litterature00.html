<h3 align="center">THE LIFE OF ST. BASIL AND THE ADDRESS TO YOUNG MEN</h3>
<p>The <i>Address to Young Men on the Right Use of Greek Literature </i>is not
the anxious admonition of a bigoted ecclesiastic, apprehensive for the supremacy
of the Sacred Writings. Rather, it is the educational theory of a cultured man,
whose familiarity with classical learning and enthusiasm for it were second only
to his knowledge of the Scriptures and zeal for righteousness. No student of the
classics in Christian times has been more significantly placed for estimating
justly the peculiar excellencies and defects of the Greek learning, and no other
scholar has written with a truer perspective, and with more sanity,
large-mindedness, and justice. These qualities in the address can be adequately
appreciated only after the reader has become acquainted with the remarkable life
of the author.</p>
<p>Moreover, the appreciation of the address demands not only that its pages be
read in the light of the author's career, but also that the place of the essay
in the development of ecclesiastical philosophy be understood.</p>
<p>Accordingly the following pages will attempt to give, first a survey of the
life of Basil, and secondly, a review of the varieties of attitude assumed
toward classical learning by those ecclesiastics who wrote prior to the time of
Basil.</p>
<p>St. Basil was born at Caesarea in the year 329, in a home of culture and
piety. His father, who came from a family which had stood high in military and
civic affairs, followed the profession of rhetoric, and was a man of wealth and
of public spirit, noted for his benefactions. His grandmother Macrina, and
mother St. Emmelia, were to him a Lois and a Eunice, and trained him in the Holy
Scriptures from his infancy. Thus Basil grew up in an atmosphere of gentleness,
of learning, and of Christian fervor. It is a sufficient comment upon this home
life that of the ten children four <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A>
became saints, St. Macrina, St. Gregory Nyssen, St. Peter, and St. Basil; that
three became bishops; and that St. Basil is one of thirteen upon whom the
Catholic Church has conferred the title of Doctor Ecclesiae.</p>
<p>When a lad, Basil was sent to Byzantium to study under Libanius, the
celebrated rhetorician and sophist, then at the height of his popularity. Under
this teacher the youth was trained in the felicities of Greek expression, and
from him derived that love for Greek literature which led him, at the age of
twenty-one, to seek the refined atmosphere of Athens, the centre of learning,
and the home of arts and letters. To this city resorted the most promising young
men of Europe and Asia, and there they devoted themselves to the acquisition of
learning with an intensity which rivaled the most flourishing days of the
schools at Alexandria,</p>
<p>Basil was welcomed to Athens by a Cappadocian youth who had himself but just
arrived, Gregory Nazianzen, and the two young men soon became fast friends. They
were well adapted to each other, for the judicial exactness of Basil, and his
poise—one might almost say his melancholy— were happily complemented by
Gregory's intellectual brilliancy, and his liveliness of disposition. Of this
friendship Gregory wrote as follows: 'It was one soul which had two bodies.
Eloquence, the most inspiring pursuit in the world, incited us to an equal
ardor, yet without creating any jealousy whatever. We lived in each other. We
knew but two walks: the first and dearest, that which led to the church and its
teachers; the other, less exalted, which led to the school and its masters.' [<i>Orat.
</i>43.]</p>
<p>A third young man who shared to some extent in this friendship was Julian,
the cousin of Constantius II, then a scholarly recluse and a Christian, but soon
to become emperor and an apostate.</p>
<p>Within a very short time, their attainments in scholarship and their
remarkable ability as public speakers gave Basil and Gregory an enviable
reputation, not only in Athens itself, but in every other city where learning
was fostered. <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After five years spent in Athens, and when he was giving every promise of an
exceptional career, Basil suddenly announced his purpose to leave the city; he
had been coming to feel that, with all of its learning, Athens laid emphasis
upon the less essential things, that, as he expressed it, 'life there was hollow
blessedness.' In this feeling Gregory to some extent shared, and accordingly
decided to leave with his friend. When the day of departure arrived, companions
and even teachers crowded around and besought them to stay, even offering
violence; but although they prevailed for the time upon the more yielding
Gregory, Basil was resolute, and retired to Caesarea.</p>
<p>For a short period he practiced law in his native city, yet, despite his
brilliant <i>début, </i>his heart was not in his work, and he decided to escape
from business cares and renounce the world. Accordingly, that he might determine
what kind of retirement would prove most agreeable, 'he traveled over much sea
and land,' <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and visited the hermits in Egypt,
Syria, and Asia Minor. On his return he sought out a wild and beautiful retreat
in Pontus, where, surrounded by lofty crags, a mountain stream tossing and
leaping near by, and a lovely plain spread out beneath, he erected a monastery,
and established a brotherhood. This was in 358.</p>
<p>For four years he led here a serene and joyous life, devoted to prayer and
psalmody, the study of the inspired writers, and peaceful labor. In the course
of time he experienced the pleasure of a visit from his beloved friend, and
years later Gregory drew a charming picture of those happy days, in which he
recalled with equal pleasure the songs of praise in the rustic chapel, and the
little plane-tree which he had planted with his own hands.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></p>
<p>Occasionally Basil left his retreat to preach to the country people, or to
perform deeds of mercy, as when, for example, in the course of a famine he sold
his lands to provide bread for the starving inhabitants of the province. It was
characteristic of the man that Jews, pagans, and Christians were treated with
equal consideration. <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this attractive life was not allowed to be permanent, for Basil was
summoned to Constantinople to aid the bishop of Ancyrus in his struggle with
Eunomius, the new and forceful exponent of the Arian heresy. Henceforth he was
never long absent from public life.</p>
<p>In 362 occurred an event which occasioned bitter enmity between Basil and
Gregory and their college friend Julian, and threatened great injury to the
cause of the church. Julian, then emperor, had invited Basil to Rome, and he was
preparing to embark, when word was received that upon the standards of the army
the cross of Christ had been replaced by the images of the gods. Basil correctly
interpreted this as indicative of apostasy, and refused to have any further
intercourse with the Emperor. Julian was greatly angered, and in retaliation
decreed that the study of the classics should be denied to Christians. These
were his haughty and ironical words: 'For us are the eloquence and the arts of
the Greeks, and the worship of the gods; for you, ignorance and rusticity, and
nothing else, I fear; so, your wisdom.' <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> This was
indeed bitter revenge, for the Church had found her hold upon classical learning
the most effective weapon against the pagans. The indignation of Gregory gives
some idea of the consternation which this decree occasioned, and of the value
which he and his friend placed upon classical learning: 'I forego all the rest,
riches, birth, honor, authority, and all goods here below of which the charm
vanishes like a dream; but I cling to oratory, nor do I regret the toil, nor the
journeys by land and sea, which I have undertaken to master it.' <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p>This announcement promised to be but the beginning of a series of
persecutions, but death providentially cut short the career of Julian in 363.</p>
<p>In the following year Basil was ordained priest by Eusebius, bishop of
Caesarea, but the fame which his sermons upon the death of Julian secured for
the young priest aroused<A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A> the jealousy
of the bishop, and Basil retired to Pontus. However, by his modest conduct he
succeeded in regaining the friendship of Eusebius, and after three years was
recalled to help check the Arian heresy. His learning, his ability as an orator,
and his fearless but gentle conduct, all fitted him for such a task.</p>
<p>In 370, despite much bitter opposition, not simply on the part of strangers,
but from his own uncle as well, Basil was raised to the episcopate of Caesarea.
The task which devolved upon him as bishop was to cultivate a spirit of harmony
and of whole-hearted service among his clergy, and, both in his own province and
indirectly in the neighboring provinces, to cherish the orthodox faith as
outlined in the Nicene creed.</p>
<p>In many respects this was the most trying period in the history of the early
Church. Christians were no longer called upon to be martyrs, as had been the
case a century before, but the wealth and prestige to which the Church had
attained was impairing that simplicity which had made the Church of the first
centuries so effective. As a result, many selfish and ambitious men were
attracted to ecclesiastical service, and it was more difficult for even an
unselfish man to lead a godly life. Moreover, the Church was divided into many
warring factions, such as the Arians, the Semi-Arians, and the Sabellians, the
Arians being especially determined and overbearing, because they had gained the
support of the emperor Valens. It is to the glory of Basil that at such a time
he stood for the Apostolic ideals.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the assumption of his new office Basil set about gaining the
good will and allegiance of those of the clergy who had opposed his election.
This work was progressing with reasonable expedition, when suddenly he was
confronted by the emperor himself and commanded to renounce the orthodox faith.
This Basil flatly refused to do, and the cowardly Valens was awed into
admiration. Henceforth Basil had nothing to fear from imperial intervention, and
yet, because most of the other bishops of the <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>
East had complied with the emperor's demands, the task of supporting the true
faith was rendered correspondingly more difficult. The Arians opposed him at
every turn, and, what was harder to bear, the Sabellians misinterpreted his
motives in trying to win back the Semi-Arians to the true faith by mildness and
sympathy, and accused him of heresy. Even some of those who professed the
orthodox belief, and who should have supported him in his heroic efforts to
preserve the integrity of the faith, misunderstood him, and, most distressing of
all, his lifelong friend Gregory accused him of attempting to turn their
friendship to selfish ends. Lastly, even the Pope and the bishops of the West
turned a deaf ear to his appeals for help. Is it any wonder that a body already
weakened by asceticism and wasted by disease gave way in this unequal struggle?</p>
<p>Basil did not live to behold the triumph of the Catholic faith. He saw but
the dark hour before the dawn. And yet he was victorious, victorious because he
kept the rank and file of the Church in Cappadocia true to the faith of the
fathers. The simple folk who hungered and thirsted after righteousness loved and
followed him, attracted by his austere living, the sweetness and integrity of
his character, his singleness of purpose, and his high thoughts. Small wonder
that this was so, for even when oppressed with the duties of his high office and
broken in body, he frequently stole away to be with these simple people, to
comfort them in their afflictions, and to teach them, in sermons which delight
us to-day equally by their Hebraic fervor and their classical form and idiom, to
behold God in his handiwork. Listen as he points out to them the glory of the
heavens: 'There is our ancient native seat, from which the murderous demon has
cast us down. If things created for time are so grand, what will be the things
of eternity? If things visible are so beautiful, what will be the invisible? If
the immensity of the skies surpasses the measure of human thought, what
intelligence can fathom the depths of eternity? If this eye of nature, which so
adorns it, this sun, which, though <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A>
perishable, is yet so beautiful, so rapid in movement, so well adapted in size
to the world, offers us an inexhaustible theme for contemplation, what will be
the beauty of the sun of divine righteousness?' <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></p>
<p>Or again: 'If the ocean is beautiful and worthy of praise to God, how much
more beautiful is the conduct of this Christian assembly, where the voices of
men, women, and children, blended and sonorous like the waves that break upon
the beach, rise amidst our prayers to the very presence of God!' <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></p>
<p>Basil's death occurred on January 1st, 279, when he was but fifty years of
age. Like many another valiant soldier of the Cross, he died with these words
upon his lips: 'Into thy hands I commend my spirit.' The scene at his funeral
was an impressive one. The entire province was given over to grief, and pagans
and Jews united with Christians in their lamentations. As the funeral procession
advanced, many perished in their desire to approach the coffin, but they were
accounted happy to die on such a day, and the people called them the funeral
victims.</p>
<p>So lived and died this scholar and man of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us now turn from the life of St. Basil to a brief consideration of the <i>Address
to Young Men </i>in relation to the attitude assumed by earlier ecclesiastics
toward Greek learning.</p>
<p>If we condense the thought of the essay into the fewest words, the result is
something as follows: While classical philosophy, oratory, and poetry even at
their best do not reveal the truth with absolute accuracy, they yet reflect it
as in a mirror; the truth may be seen face to face only in the Scriptures, yet
it is possible in the pagan writings to trace, as it were, its silhouette.
Accordingly, for those who are not yet prepared for the strong meat of the
Scriptures, the study of Greek literature is a valuable preparatory course.</p>
<p>This is virtually the attitude taken toward classical <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A>
learning by several of the early Church writers, and, therefore a survey of so
much of the ecclesiastical philosophy as concerns Greek poetry and philosophy
will help to establish the antecedents of Basil's essay.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that, when Christianity came in contact with the
speculative genius of the Greeks and the Oriental pantheistic naturalism, there
should be an effort to advance from Christian faith to Christian knowledge, and
to discover a philosophic basis for the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. This
first effort was made by the so-called Gnostics, who exerted their greatest
influence in the middle of the second century. The Hellenic Gnostics attempted
to employ the writings of the Greek philosophers to explain the Scriptures, but
the many perplexing questions which they strove to answer soon led them as far
away from the doctrines of Plato as from those of Paul. Beginning with the
attempt to discover the allegorical significance of the Scriptures, Gnosticism
ended in mere chimerical speculation, in mysticism, mythology, and theosophy. It
exerted little permanent influence, and by the time of Basil was no longer a
force in religious controversy.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously with the flourishing of Gnosticism, however, wrote Justin
Martyr, who influenced very much the ecclesiastical writers of the East during
the third and fourth centuries. As a young man Justin made a thorough study of
the Greek philosophy, being especially attracted to the writings of Plato and of
the Stoics, but as he grew older his admiration for the fortitude of the
Christians, and for their sublime faith—an admiration which was intensified by
his growing distrust in the sovereignty of human reason—led him to embrace
Christianity. Henceforth he was the champion of the new religion. This, however,
was not at the expense of Greek philosophy, for his breadth of view enabled him
to recognize the worth both of the profane and of the Sacred Writings.</p>
<p>Justin bases his philosophy upon the Logos of John's Gospel. Wherever truth
is found, it is an expression of the <A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A>
divine Logos; Plato, Homer, Pythagoras, and Solon received partial revelations
of it, and indeed it reveals itself somewhat to every man, though the one
perfect and complete revelation is Christ, who is the Logos incarnate.</p>
<p>For our present purpose we need observe in detail only that phase of Justin's
philosophy which is concerned with classical literature. Greek philosophy and
poetry are to be esteemed highly, because, to an unusual degree, they express
the divine revelation. Not only did such men as Homer and Plato experience
revelations of the truth, but they were also familiar with the teachings of
Moses, and indeed with all of the Old Testament. Such doctrines in Plato as
eternal punishment, the immortality of the soul, and the freedom of the will,
were borrowed from the early Jewish books.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></p>
<p>Of the other four prominent apologists of the second century, Tatian,
Hernias, and Theophilus condemn and ridicule Greek philosophy, and Athenagoras
assumes an attitude similar to that of Justin. Tatian, who was an Assyrian,
abused all things Greek with barbaric severity,<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>Hermas wrote an <i>Abuse of the Pagan Philosophers, </i>and Theophilus
called the doctrines of the Greek philosophers foolishness.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
Athenagoras, on the other hand, esteemed the Greek philosophers, and quoted them
in support of the unity of God, a truth which he believed the Spirit had
revealed to them despite the prevailing polytheism of their country.<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></p>
<p>The closing years of the second century and the first half of the third were
engrossed in the controversy which the Gnostics had aroused. Anti-Gnosticism
found its most spirited champion in Tertullian, the foremost Latin
ecclesiastical writer of the early centuries. Tertullian believed that
Christianity alone possessed the truth, that philosophy was the source of all
heresies, and that Plato and other Greek philosophers, though they had stolen
certain isolated truths <A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A> from Moses,
which they arrogated to themselves, were exponents of falsehood. So extreme was
his antipathy to philosophy that he eventually declared: <i>Credo quid absurdum
est.</i><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></p>
<p>On the other hand Clement of Alexandria and his pupil, Origen, the founder of
the school to which Basil, Gregory Nyssen, and Gregory Nazianzen adhered,
endeavored to separate the true from the false in Gnosticism. Both of them laid
much stress upon the value of Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>Ueberweg gives the following comprehensive digest of Clement's views
concerning the relation of the pagan writings to the Scriptures: 'Clement adopts
the view of Justin, that to Christianity, as the whole truth, the conceptions of
ante-Christian times are opposed, not as mere errors, but as partial truths. The
divine Logos, which is everywhere poured out, like the light of the sun (<i>Stromata
</i>v. 3), enlightened the souls of men from the beginning. It instructed the
Jews through Moses and the prophets (<i>Paedagogus </i>i. 7). Among the Greeks,
on the contrary, it called forth wise men, and gave them, through the mediation
of the lower angels, whom the Logos had appointed to be shepherds of the nations
(<i>Strom. </i>vii. 2), philosophy as a guide to righteousness (<i>Strom. </i>i.
5; vi. 5). Like Justin, Clement maintains that the philosophers took much of
their doctrine secretly from the Orientals, and, in particular, from the
religious books of the Jews, which doctrine they then, from desire of renown,
falsely proclaimed as the result of their own independent investigations,
besides falsifying and corrupting it <i>(Strom. </i>i. i. 17; <i>Paed. </i>ii.
i). Yet some things pertaining to true doctrine were really discovered by the
Greek philosophers, by the aid of the seed of the divine Logos implanted in them
<i>(Cohortatio </i>vi. 59). Plato was the best of the Greek philosophers (<font face="SPIonic">o(
pa&amp;nta a1ristoj Pla&amp;twn, . . . . oi9on<i> </i>qeoforou&amp;menoj</font>,
<i>Paed. </i>iii. 11; <i>Strom. </i>v. 8). The Christian must choose out that
which is true in the writings of the different philosophers, <i>i. e., </i>whatever
agrees with Christianity <i>(Strom. </i>i. 7; vi. 17). We need the aid of <A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A>
philosophy in order to advance from faith (<font face="SPIonic">pi/stij</font>)
to knowledge (<font face="SPIonic">gnw~sij</font>). The Gnostic is to him who
merely believes without knowing as the grown-up man to the child; having
outgrown the fear of the Old Testament, he has arrived at a higher stage of the
divine plan of man's education. Whoever will attain to Gnosis without
philosophy, dialectic, and the study of nature, is like him who expects to
gather grapes without cultivating the grapevine <i>(Strom. </i>i. 9). But the
criterion of true science must always be the harmony of the latter with faith <i>(Strom.
</i>ii. 4).'<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p>Of Origen, who was the last ecclesiastical philosopher of influence in the
Eastern church prior to the fourth century, it is enough to say that he assumed
the same attitude toward the Greek writers as did his master.</p>
<p>One who has read Basil's essay will readily appreciate the similarity between
the views of Basil and those of Justin, Athenagoras, Clement, and Origen. The
chapters in the essay might almost be arranged as expositions of the various
elements in the above digest from Clement's writings. There is the same belief
in the partial inspiration of the Greek poets and philosophers, the same
advocacy of the study of Hellenic literature as an introduction to the study of
Christianity, the common credence in the indebtedness of Plato and other
philosophers to Moses and the Prophets, and the like insistence upon life as a
growth, and upon knowledge as the complement of faith.</p>
<p>To summarize this brief review: For at least two centuries before Basil wrote
his <i>Address to Young Men on the Right Use of Greek Literature </i>efforts had
been made to determine the true relation between Greek learning and
Christianity. Some writers bitterly opposed Hellenic philosophy and poetry,
others recognized that it contained a partial revelation of the truth. To the
latter view Justin and his followers inclined, and among these followers one of
the most pronounced is Basil.</p>
