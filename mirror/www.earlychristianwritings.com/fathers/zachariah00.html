<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>IN Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 17,202 there is a historical work in Syriac, which has
been published by Dr. Land <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><i> </i>under the title
of <i>Zachariae Ep. Mitylenes aliorumque scripta historica Graece plerumque
deperdita. </i>In the MS. the Chronicle bears no author's name, but is simply
entitled, <i>A volume of records of events which have happened in the world. </i>Extracts
from the same work are contained (also anonymously) in <i>Cod. Syr. Vat. </i>14.6
<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> (formerly 24), fol. 78ff. An account of these
extracts, with quotations, was given by Assemani,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
and the whole was published with a Latin translation by Mai in 1838.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
A passage found among these Vatican fragments is quoted by Dionysius Bar Tsalibi
as from &quot;Zachariah the Rhetor and bishop of Melitene,&quot;<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
whence Assemani entitled the author &quot;Zachariah of Melitene.&quot; The name
of Zachariah is confirmed by the fact that Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 12,154 contains
two extracts from our Chronicle, which it cites as from the &quot;Ecclesiastical
History of Zachariah.&quot;<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Further, Evagrius, in
bks. 2 and 3 of his History, frequently cites a Monophysite writer whom he calls
Zachariah the Rhetor, and these citations agree closely with our text.
&quot;Zachariah the Rhetor&quot; is also cited by Michael the Syrian <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
(who is copied by Gregory Abu'l <A NAME="p2"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|2</SPAN></A> Farag)
for the first Synod of Ephesus, the story of the Seven Sleepers, events of the
reign of Marcian, and the plague in that of Justinian.</p>
<p>On turning, however, to the work as preserved in the London MS. we find that
in the appendix to bk. 2 the author states that bk. 3 is drawn &quot;for the
most part from the Chronicle of Zachariah, a rhetor, which he wrote in Greek to
a man named Eupraxius, who lived at the Court, and was devoted to the service of
the king and queen&quot; ; and the first chapter of bk. 3 opens with the preface
of Zachariah addressed to Eupraxius. Again, in the appendix to bk. 6 it is
stated that that book is derived &quot;from the Greek Chronicle of Zachariah the
Rhetor, who wrote down to this point at great length, according to the Greek
practice of diffuseness.&quot; From this it is clear that the work of Zachariah
ended in 491, and that he was only one of the authorities used by the compiler
of the work before us, who followed him in bks. 3—6 only, and to whom the name
of Zachariah was wrongly attached by later writers. This is confirmed by the
facts that each of the bks. 4-6, and no others, is stated in the preface to be
taken from Zachariah, that the words &quot;Ecclesiastical History of
Zachariah&quot; are found at the top of the page (with two exceptions in bk. i)
in bks. 3—6 only, and that the citations in Evagrius are confined to these
same books. (See Land, Introd. pp. x—xiii.) <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></p>
<p>As to the identity of Zachariah, the Life of Isaiah the monk, published by
Dr. Land<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> from Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 12,174, fol. 142,
is in the MS. ascribed to &quot;Zachariah the Scholastic, who wrote the
Ecclesiastical History,&quot; and a Life of Severus by the same author has been
published by Dr. Spanuth<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A><sup> </sup>from a MS. at
Berlin (Sachau Collection, 321).<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> From the <A NAME="p3"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|3</SPAN></A>
latter we learn that Zachariah was a native of Gaza, that he studied law in
company with Severus at Alexandria and Berytus in the reign of Zeno, and that he
practised as an advocate at Constantinople, where he was living at the time of
writing the Life. There can therefore be little hesitation in identifying him
with the &quot;Zachariah of Gaza&quot; to whom an ode of John of Gaza is
addressed, with the &quot;Zachariah&quot; to whom several letters of Procopius
of Gaza are addressed,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> and with the author of the
Dialogue, <i>De Mundi Opificio</i>,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A><i> </i>inscribed
&quot;<font face="SPIonic">Zaxari/ou<i> </i>Sxolastikou~ Xristianou~ tou~
genome/nou meta_ tau~ta e0pisko&amp;pou Mitulh&amp;nhj</font>,&quot; who in his
preface states that he had studied at Alexandria. The &quot;Melitene&quot; of
Dionysius Bar Tsalibi is therefore an error for &quot;Mitylene.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Zachariah of Mitylene was present at the Synod of 536, but in 553 the see
was occupied by Palladius. Hence we may infer that Zachariah, a rhetor ,or
scholastic of Gaza, residing in Constantinople, between 491 and 518 wrote an
Ecclesiastical History of the years 450-491, and also between 511 and 518 wrote
a Life of Severus,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> at a later time, conforming
perhaps to the Chalcedonian faith,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> was made
bishop of Mitylene, and died or was deposed between 536 and 553.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
The courtier Eupraxius, to whom the History is dedicated, is mentioned also in
the Life of Severus in terms which imply that he was dead,<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
from which it seems to follow that the History was written before the Life. He
is no doubt the same as Eupraxius the chamberlain, to whom a letter of Severus
is addressed.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zachariah's work then forms the basis of our Syriac author's bks. 3-6. The
author did not, however, incorporate Zachariah in full, but epitomated him, as
is clear from the fact that Evagrius quotes as from Zachariah a statement which
is not found in our text.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> On the other hand, the
main narrative in these books is so homogeneous that in general we may assume
that no other source was used. In 3. 1, however, occur three passages which are
found in almost identical words in John of Ephesus,<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
and must therefore have been interpolated either from John or from a common
source, since the identity of language forbids us to postulate a common use of
the Greek Zachariah. To another source also may be ascribed the list of Emperors
and short secular chronicle with which bk. 3 concludes, the chronological
summary at the end of the preface to bk. 4, for which the authority of a certain
<font face="SPIonic">xroniko&amp;n</font><i> </i>is cited,<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
and the notice of Zeno's death and the secular events of his reign in 6. 6.</p>
<p>The compilation opens with an introductory chapter containing a general plan
of the work, from which it is clear that the whole work, heterogeneous as it is,
is the deliberate composition of one man, not a mere collection of extracts. As
to the personality of the writer, there are two possible indications, one in 7.
5 (p. 161), where, in speaking of a certain Gadono who took part in the campaign
at Amida in 503, he says, &quot;I know him&quot;; and another in 9. 18 (p. 264),
where the same expression is used of an Italian named Dominic or Demonicus, who
fled to Constantinople during the Gothic rule; but in neither case can we feel
certain that the author is not copying the expression of some other writer,—a
supposition which is supported in the former instance by the early date of the
events related, in the latter by the fact that John of Ephesus, whom <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A>
our author appears to have used (see below), resided at Constantinople, while
our author's interests lay entirely in the East.<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
As to the place of writing, in 12. 5 the author speaks of an event which
happened at Amida as happening &quot;here,&quot; from which it may be inferred
that he was living at Amida, or at any rate in Mesopotamia;<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
and a connexion with Amida is also rendered probable by his acquaintance with
Eustace, the architect of Amida, which may be gathered from 9. 19 (p. 267), the
special mention of the Amidene who was appointed to command the guard at
Alexandria in 10. 1, and the author's intercourse with the Amidene captives
mentioned in 12.7 (p. 329).<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> If 7. 3-5 is
original, the intimate acquaintance with the history of Amida there shown must
further be added.</p>
<p>The date of writing is given in I. 1 and I. 3 as A.S. 880 = A.D. 569. This
must have been the date of the completion of the work, of which different parts
were written at different times; thus 12. 4 was written in 561, and 12. 7 in 555
; 10. 12, which I have restored from Michael (see below), would appear, on the <i>prima
facie </i>interpretation of the words to have been written in 545 ; but, since
the style of the narrative makes it incredible that it was written within a year
of the events recorded, &quot;this year 8&quot; must be understood to mean
&quot;this year 8, with which we are now dealing.&quot;<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
Throughout the history of Justinian's reign the author speaks of the Emperor in
terms which imply that he was still living.</p>
<p>In respect of the date a difficulty arises from the use of John of Ephesus,
which use seems to be proved by the facts <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>
concerning the letter of Simeon of Beth Arsham in 8. 3. Of this letter our
author and John (preserved in the Chronicle attributed to Dionysius<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>)
have practically the same version, and this version is an abbreviation of the
original letter, which is preserved in Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 14,650 and in a MS.
in the Museum Borgianum and has been edited by Prof. Guidi.<sup><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
</sup>Now two men cannot have made the same epitome of the same document; hence
one must have copied the other; and that the copyist was our author appears from
the fact that in his work the letter stands alone, while in John it is embedded
in a narrative of Homerite affairs. Again, our author's account of the bishops
of Amida in 8. 5 is so similar to that in Assem., <i>B. O. </i>vol. ii. pp. 48,
49, that, though the divergences show that it is not slavishly copied from it,
it is scarcely credible that it is wholly independent.<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
The second part of John's History was, however, not completed before 571,<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
while our author, as we have seen, finished his work in 569. It is not, however,
necessary to suppose that the whole of John's second part was published at one
time; indeed we know from his own statement <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> that
a narrative of the persecution which began in 518, which, if not a portion of
the Ecclesiastical History, must have been afterwards in great measure
incorporated with it, and may well have included an account of the persecution
of the Homerites, was published by him thirty years before 567. If, indeed, this
date is to be taken literally, it is too early for our purpose, since the
headings of the lost chs. 2, 3 of our bk. 10, <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>
dealing with the persecution of Abraham Bar Khili at Amida in 537-539,
correspond with chapters in &quot;Dionysius,&quot; <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
who wrote out John, and must therefore be assumed to be derived from the
latter's work.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> In one of the fragments of the
History,<sup><A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> </sup>however, John mentions an
account of this persecution written by him, from which it follows either that
the history of the persecution was not written before 539, or that a later work
dealing with this second persecution was afterwards added. In either case we
have a sufficient explanation of our author's use of John. Our author did not,
however, merely copy John of Ephesus, even for events preceding 540. For
instance, John's account of the earthquake of Antioch in 526 is preserved,<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
and is quite different from our author's, and his account of the persecution at
Edessa under Asclepius<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> is very hard to combine
with the narrative in our text (8. 4). But the true relation between the two can
only be solved when the full text of &quot;Dionysius&quot; has been published.</p>
<p>This complication often makes it impossible to determine whether a particular
passage of Michael is derived from our author or from John; and therefore,
though the references should give only sources and parallels, not derivatives, I
have thought it best to give the references to Michael throughout rather than
venture on arbitrary decisions,<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> which might be
misleading. As Michael is not published, I have added references to his copyist
Gregory.<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> There is, however, one test by which it
is sometimes possible to discriminate, and that is the method of dating; for
John dates by Seleucid years only, while our author uses also the indictional
reckoning, and generally writes the numeral in Greek, a practice found also <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A>
in the Edessene Chronicle.<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> The use of this method
in certain passages in Michael has enabled me to restore some lost chapters in
bk. 10.</p>
<p>The first book, after the introductory chapter and a discussion of the
chronology of Genesis, contains the History of Joseph and Asnath,<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
the Acts of Silvester,<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> and the narrative of the
discovery of the relics of Stephen, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus by the presbyter
Lucian,<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> concluding with a short account of two
early Syriac writers. Bk. 2, ch. 1, contains the Acts of the Seven Sleepers,<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
while in ch. 2 the continuous historical narrative opens with the Synod of
Constantinople in 448, and at the end of bk. 9 it is brought down to the capture
of Rome in 536. Bks. 2—6 are almost wholly ecclesiastical, but bks. 7—9
contain much valuable information on secular matters, particularly on the
relations between Rome and Persia. So far the work is practically complete,<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
but the <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A> remaining books are
unfortunately fragmentary. Of bk. 10, in which the history is continued to 548,
we have the headings of the chapters complete and portions of the chapters
themselves;<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> the lost chapters I have been able in
part to restore from Michael, Gregory, and the fragments of James of Edessa.<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
Bk. 11 is wholly lost: of bk. 12 we have a fragment extending from the middle of
ch. 4 to the middle of ch. 7, and dealing with the years 553-556. The original
work was, as we are told in the introductory chapter, brought down to 569.</p>
<p>The legendary matter at the beginning, though of great value for comparison
with other versions of the same legends, stands quite apart from the rest of the
work ; and, as it does not contain anything which does not exist in Greek or
Latin, it does not appear worth the space that would be required for translating
it, and is therefore omitted. Of the remainder the translation of I. 9, bk. 2
(omitting ch. 1), and bks. 3-7 is the work of Dr. Hamilton,<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
while for the introductory chapter, bks. 8 and 9, and the fragments of bks. 10
and 12 <A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> I am responsible.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Land, as he states in his preface,<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
thought it better to spend his time in copying fresh documents than in revising
his transcripts, his text is naturally far from accurate, and an examination of
the MS. has enabled us in many instances to correct it. The MS. itself, however,
is considerably corrupted, and supplies a text inferior to that of the Roman
MS., which is later in date. All departures from Land's text on the authority of
the MS., or of Cod. Rom. (which I have examined), or by conjecture, are noted,
except in the case of (1) punctuation, including plural marks; (2) <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A>
division of words; (3) final [Syriac] or [Syriac]; (4) foreign proper names and
technical terms, where there is no doubt what is meant. In many places
assistance has been derived from the work of other writers, of whom mention is
made in the notes.</p>

bk. 7 to Zachariah. The different character of that book is enough to show that
it is derived from another source. It does not, however, follow that it was not

he also wrote a Life of Peter the Iberian ; but the Life contained in this MS.
and in Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 12,174, and edited by Dr.Raabe (Leipzig, 1895), is
not his (see Raabe's Introduction). The Life of Theodosius, published by Land <i>(Anecd.
Syr. </i>iii. p. 341) from Add. 12,174, is ascribed by him to Zachariah ; but
the discrepancies with the account in our 3. 9 make this ascription very
doubtful. All these lives exist in Syriac only.</p>

occurs in the analysis of Jo. Eph. given by M. Nau from &quot;Dionysius,&quot;

obscure event is recorded makes it probable that the author was a native of
Amida. Jo. Eph. was also an Amidene, but the late date of this event makes it
unlikely that the narrative was derived from his work (see below). Moreover, at
that time he seems to have been living in Constantinople or Asia Minor.</p>

321 ff., and by Prof. Nöldeke, in <i>Vienna Oriental Journal, </i>tom. x. p.
160 ff., that the attribution of this Chronicle to Dionysius is a mere blunder
of Assemani; but, as the name is too well established to abandon, I refer to it
as &quot;Dionysius.&quot; I may here add that from Mich. (fol. 223) it appears
that the work of Dionysius, whose preface is there given in full, began at 582,
and was a continuation of Cyrus of Batnae.</p>
<p><A NAME="#27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> <i>Atti dell' Accademia de' Lincei, </i>ser.
3, tom. vii.</p>
<p><A NAME="#28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> See also Hallier, <i>Untersuchungen
über die Edessenische Chronik, </i>p. 67. His argument from the list of
banished bishops, which Mich. (fol. 161 v.) quotes as from Jo. Eph., is,
however, not quite conclusive, since our author's account in 8. 5 is somewhat
different, and the correspondence as to Akhs'noyo may be explained if both drew
from the letter to which our author refers.</p>
<p><A NAME="#29"></A>29.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Jo. Eph. pt. iii. I. 3.</p>
<p><A NAME="#30"></A>30.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> <i>De Beat. Orient</i>. 35 (<i>Anecd.
Syr. </i>ii. pp. 203, 212 ; transl. pp. 130, 135).</p>
<p><A NAME="#31"></A>31.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <i>Cod. Syr. Vat. </i>162, fol. 96. I
made a cursory examination of this MS. in 1894, but I owe most of my knowledge
of &quot;Dionysius&quot; (apart from Assemani's extracts) to M. Nau's analysis
(see p. 4, note).</p>
<p><A NAME="#32"></A>32.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> It does not follow that the narrative
itself was copied, since our author may have taken his subjects from John, and
given his own account of the events.</p>
<p><A NAME="#33"></A>33.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> <i>Anecd. Syr. </i>ii. p. 294;
transl. p. 221.</p>
<p><A NAME="#34"></A>34.&nbsp;<i><sup>4</sup> Anecd. Syr. </i>ii. p. 299 ff.;
transl. p. 224 ff.</p>
<p><A NAME="#35"></A>35.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> <i>Anecd. Syr. </i>ii. p. 291 ff. ;
transl. p. 2i9ff.</p>
<p><A NAME="#36"></A>36.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> This does not apply to the Zachariah
books, in which there can be no doubt that he copies our author.</p>
<p><A NAME="#37"></A>37.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> The references to the <i>Chronicon
Syriacum </i>are to the edition of Bedjan.</p>
<p><A NAME="#38"></A>38.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> See Hallier, <i>op. cit. </i>p. 41.</p>
<p><A NAME="#39"></A>39.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> The translation from the Greek is
ascribed to Moses of Ingila. This chapter has been translated into Latin by
Oppenheim (Berlin, 1886). Part of the Greek version of this legend and a Latin
epitome were published by Fabricius (<i>Cod. Pseudepigr. V. T. </i>vols. i. and
ii.), and a complete text in Greek and Latin has now been published from several
MSS. by the Abbe Batiffol (Paris, 1889-1890). The Greek text has been again
edited by V. M. Istrin (Moscow, 1898).</p>
<p><A NAME="#40"></A>40.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> The Greek Acts are published in
Combefis, <i>Christi martyrum lecti triumphi. </i>Portions are also given by
Cedrenus, and in a shorter form by Geo. Mon. and Zonaras. A Latin version with
large additions exists in a book entered in Brit. Mus. Catalogue under
&quot;Eusebius,&quot; and supposed to have been published at Strassburg in 1470.
Another with slight variations is in Mombritius, <i>Sanctuarium, </i>vol. ii.,
and the Jewish dispute was published by Wicelius (Maintz, 1544). An epitome is
in Surius, <i>Act. Sanct., </i>Dec. 31. The Syriac Acts are also in Add. MS.
12,174, but without the Jewish dispute. See article of A. L. Frothingham in <i>Memorie
dell' Accademia de' Liucei, </i>1882.</p>
<p><A NAME="#41"></A>41.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Lucian's letter exists in two Latin
versions in Migne, <i>Patr. Lat. </i>vol. xli. p. 807 ff. The Greek original is
mentioned by Fabricius (<i>Bibl. Graec. </i>vol. x. p. 327), but is not
published. An epitome is given in Photius, <i>Bibl. Cod. </i>171, which contains
a passage found in our author but not in either of the Latin texts. Another
Latin version, with slight variations from the first of the two in Migne, is
published in Mombritius, <i>Sanctuarium, </i>vol. ii.</p>
<p><A NAME="#42"></A>42.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> For the various versions of this
legend see <i>Act. Sanct., </i>Jul. vol. vi. p. 375 ff., and Guidi, <i>Testi
Orientali Inediti sopra i Sette Dormienti di Efeso </i>(<i>Atti dell' Accademia
de' Lincei</i>, ser. 3, tom. xii.). The Greek Acts are in Migne, <i>Patr. Graec.
</i>vol. cxv. p. 428. A Syriac version similar to our author's is in Add. MS.
14,641, fol. 150. El. Nis. quotes the legend from &quot;John the Jacobite,&quot;
<i>i.e. </i>John of Ephesus.</p>
<p><A NAME="#43"></A>43.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Setting aside small tears and
obliterations, the only losses are a part of I. 6, where a leaf has been lost,
and the end of I. 5, which is also missing. The beginning of I. 6, also
contained on this latter leaf or leaves, is supplied by Dr. Land from Add. MS.
7190.</p>
<p><A NAME="#44"></A>44.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> 10. 16 and a part of 10. 15, missing
in Cod. Brit., are found in Cod. Rom.</p>
<p><A NAME="#45"></A>45.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 14,685.</p>
<p><A NAME="#46"></A>46.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> A translation of bks. 3-6 was
privately printed by Dr. Hamilton in 1892. No other continuous translation,
except of the Vatican fragments, has as yet appeared.</p>
<p><A NAME="#47"></A>47.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> The epitome of Ptolemy's Geography in
12. 7 is omitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="#48"></A>48.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> P. xiv.</p>
