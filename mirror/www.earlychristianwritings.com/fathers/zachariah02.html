2.</b></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">BOOK II</h3>
<p align="center">THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND BOOK</p>
<p>AFTER the <i>Ecclesiastical History </i>of Eusebius of Caesarea, both
Socrates and Theodoret, in the treatises which they successively composed,
reaching down to the thirty-second year of the reign of Theodosius the Less,
wrote for the memory and profit of the prudent, as best they were able, accounts
of the transactions and matters that occurred in various places, which they were
diligent in learning from the volumes, and letters, and records,<sup> </sup>and
words of living speakers, that they examined.</p>
<p>And accordingly I also, insignificant though I be, am beginning to write, as
you asked me, for the instruction of the brethren, and for the gratification of
the lovers of doctrine, and for the confirmation of believers, Christ our Lord
and God consenting and aiding and giving the word of power—by your great
advice, diligent brother, and while you pray that I may write the truth with
eloquence without confusion or cause for blame.</p>
<p>For when, making a commencement of this treatise of the second Book, I am
relating, as concisely as possible, without prolonging the discourse or being
wearisome to the reader or tedious to the hearer, what I was able to discover
from records and Acts or from letters,—truth that was carefully examined,— I
shall set down here the truth of the resurrection, which took place in the days
of Theodosius the king, of the bodies of the seven youths who were in a cave in
the district <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>&nbsp; of Ephesus, and
the Syriac records ; both to keep them in the memory of the saints and for the
glory of God, Who is able to do all things.</p>
<p>And then I shall set down briefly in the form of chapters, so that the
account may not be enlarged of the events of one period which we write in detail
in the Acts that are found in every place, what happened during the ten
remaining years of the life of Theodosius, but in this Book I am writing them so
to speak—what happened in Constantinople respecting Eutyches the archimandrite
and Flavian the chief priest, and the Synod of thirty-one bishops and twenty-two
archimandrites who met together and who brought about the deprivation of
Eutyches ; and also respecting the second Synod which was held in Ephesus
concerning Flavian in the days of Dioscorus and Juvenalis and Domnus, and the
one hundred and twenty-eight bishops who were with them.</p>
<p>And then I begin with the third Book.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER II</b></p>
<p align="center">THE SECOND CHAPTER TELLS ABOUT THE HERESY OF EUTYCHES THE
PRESBYTER, AND HIS DEPRIVATION</p>
<p>There was, in the days of king Theodosius, one Eutyches, a presbyter and
archimandrite, a recluse belonging to those who dwell in Constantinople. This
man was visited by many (who resorted to him ostensibly on account of his
chastity and piety) who happened to be in the city, and especially by the
soldiers of the palace, who were lovers of doctrine. For at that time Nestorius,
who was ejected, was being justly reviled because of his filthy doctrine. This
Nestorius it was who held and taught base opinions respecting the Incarnation of
God the Word ; and he imagined that the two Natures existed separately in Christ
our God after the union ; and he held the precedence of the infant who was
conceived and formed in the Virgin, whom he also called <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
Jesus and Christ; and he thought that God the Word at length descended upon Him,
views scarcely differing from those of Paul of Samosata, and much the same as
the teaching of the school of Diodorus, which he studied, accepted, and loved;
but he lightly and without compunction refused to call the . ever-virgin, holy
Mary, by the title &quot;Theotokos,&quot;<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><i> </i>even
though the true doctors who were before him, Athanasius and Gregory and Basil
and Julius, and the others, had so called her ; and, moreover, he also censured
them, as the letter testifies which he wrote from Oasis to the clergy and
citizens. Whereupon, many being disturbed by his doctrine, a Synod, consisting
of one hundred and ninety-three bishops, was assembled at Ephesus ; and it
carefully examined his teaching ; and it called upon him three times, according
to the canonical rule of the Church, to apologise and to censure his own
interpretations, and at length to confess Jesus to be God the Word Who became
incarnate, one Person and one Nature, as the doctors of the holy Church teach.
But he would not consent, as also Socrates relates in the short account which he
wrote of him, and which is fully told in the original Acts.<sup> </sup>Consequently
his deprivation took place in the days of Celestine, Cyril, and Juvenalis,
before the arrival of John of Antioch and his attendant bishops, who were
delayed.</p>
<p>It<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> was somewhere about this time that Eutyches,
wishing to affirm the one Nature in Christ, rejected the truth of the body
derived from the Virgin, which God the Word took in her and from her. And in the
conversation which he held with those who came together to him, this same
Eutyches affirmed an inaccurate dogma, not having been well instructed.</p>
<p>But he taught many that (the Word became flesh) <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
as <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A> the atmosphere assumes bodily
form and becomes rain or snow under the influence of the wind, or as water by
reason of the cold air becomes ice.</p>
<p>And <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> when the report of his vile teaching was
published abroad it was investigated by Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who happened to
be in the city; and he informed Flavian, the chief priest, concerning it, and he
gave him an indictment.</p>
<p>And he was called upon three times by thirty-one bishops who were there and
twenty-two. archimandrites, to come forward and apologise for his opinions, and
abjure them, and make a written statement of the true confession. And at first,
indeed, he would not do so, at one time saying that it was<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><i>
</i>his fixed determination to remain in perpetual seclusion, and again, that he
was sick, and had a cough, and was old; (and he made these excuses) relying upon
the aid of the soldiers of the palace, who were his friends. Now the king heard
of these matters. But at last, when his deprivation was decreed to take place,
he was compelled to appear before the council of bishops ; however, he did not
recant his doctrine with whole-hearted sincerity, but kept on saying, &quot;Just
as you teach two Natures in Christ, so do I say.&quot;</p>
<p>And, behold ! all these things are written expressly, one after another, in
lengthened discourse in the Acts of that Council. However, that we may not make
our narrative too long, but may compress much into small compass, as the wise
man says,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> we refrain from relating them again in
detail and writing them down here. Then his deprivation took place. Now in the
accusations against him and in the interlocutions,<sup> </sup>and more
especially in what was said by Eusebius of Dorylaeum when contending with him,
the two Natures after the union were expressly taught in conformity with the
doctrine of Nestorius.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> And the interlocution of
Flavian set forth the same views. And <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Eutyches,
rejecting the party of Flavian <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A> and
Eusebius, who deposed him, sent a libel<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i> </i>to
Rome to Leo, who was the chief priest there, begging that these matters should
be investigated in another Synod ; with regard to which libel he received a
reply. And when the party of Flavian heard it they also wrote,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
and sent the Acts of the Council concerning Eutyches to Leo. And the latter
wrote to Flavian the letter called the Tome, in which there are many heads that
have been condemned by the dogmatic doctors; which also were censured at that
time by Dioscorus and his followers, and again by Timothy the Great, who was
with him, and by many treatises of others, which we omit to mention again here
and to write down.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER III</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> THIRD CHAPTER GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN
  CONCISE TERMS OF THE SECOND SYNOD WHICH WAS HELD IN EPHESUS, ABOUT THE MATTER
  OF FLAVIAN THE CHIEF PRIEST AND EUTYCHES THE MONK</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly a Synod was convened, the second in Ephesus, about the matter of
Flavian and Eutyches; and it was held in the presence of the legates of Leo, who
were sent with his letter. And the bishops came together there to the number of
one hundred and eighty-eight, the chief rulers among them being Dioscorus of
Alexandria, and Juvenalis of Jerusalem, and Domnus of Antioch. And the contents
of the Acts of the Constantinopolitan Council concerning Eutyches were examined;<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
and Flavian and Eusebius were ejected. And an outcry was raised by the bishops
who were there ; and they anathematised every one who would say, &quot; There
are two <A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A> Natures in Christ after the
union.&quot; But a question was also raised again there about what Theodoret of
Cyrrhus wrote censuring the twelve Heads which Cyril drew up against Nestorius,
who was previously banished ; and about the letter of Hibo of Edessa which he
wrote to Moris of Nisibis in opposition to Cyril and in favour of Nestorius ;
and about what he said in his interpretations concerning Jesus Christ and Mary,
as his own deacons, who were his accusers, testified. And besides these the
partisans of John of Gaios<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> and others were
deposed. But Eutyches the archimandrite was received, because he presented a
libel of recantation to the Synod, which was held there in Ephesus, and
confessed the true faith. But the Synod appointed Anatolius as bishop of
Constantinople in the room of Flavian, and then dispersed.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IV</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FOURTH CHAPTER DESCRIBES THE REGULAR SUCCESSION OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS
  WHO HELD OFFICE FROM THE FIRST SYNOD OF EPHESUS TO THE DEATH OF KING
  THEODOSIUS, IN THE DAYS OF VALENTINUS,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><sup> </sup>WHO
  WAS SUCCEEDED BY MARCIAN, THE CONVENER OF THE SYNOD OF CHALCEDON IN BITHYNIA,
  WHICH MET IN THE YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FOUR OF THE GREEK ERA OF
  ALEXANDER</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to the regular succession of the chief priests from the first
Synod of Ephesus to the death of Theodosius, it is pertinent to our subject to
relate who they were. In <A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A> Rome, after
Celestine, Leo was bishop for twenty-one years and forty-three days ; and in
Alexandria, after Cyril, Dioscorus was bishop for eight years and three months.
And in Constantinople, Maximus<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> for two years and
two months ; and after him, Proclus for two years and two months; and after him,
Flavian for six years ; and after him, Anatolius for eight years. In Antioch,
Domnus was bishop after John ; and after him Maximus. And in Jerusalem,
Juvenalis was bishop for thirty-six years, who, holding the same position, was
present at the three Synods, because the time of his years was protracted.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER V</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIFTH CHAPTER CONTAINS THE LETTER OF PROCLUS, CHIEF PRIEST OF
  CONSTANTINOPLE, TO THE ARMENIANS. IT IS A VERY EXCELLENT LETTER, SHOWING THE
  FAITH OF THE MAN ; AND TO PRESERVE IT IN MEMORY WE HAVE TRANSCRIBED IT HERE
  FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BELIEVING BROTHERS&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">THE LETTER OF PROCLUS.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;Beloved, the mystery of the true faith is true love, and the pure
undoubting confession of the Trinity equal, undivided, and susceptible of no
addition ; and a mind not varying in its state, but steadfast in its faith
towards God. That is the faith which we do not possess on tables of stone, as in
the type, but receive on the tables of our hearts, as in a mystery; tables (I
say) which are nailed to the cross, and are inscribed with the sprinkling of the
blood of God. And it is right for us not only to believe, but also to follow
earnestly after virtues and morals worthy of the faith.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
For virtue is to be chosen by everyone, especially by those whose beauty of soul
has not been corrupted by a hateful life of lusts. There are indeed <A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
many kinds of virtue. For even the heathen, drowned in error and lost in mind,
wrote memorable things<i> </i>concerning this virtue. But as for this nature
which is visible and flows on without cessation, they only felt after it in
their written teaching. But either their sight was dim from length of time, or
they were blinded by error, so as to hinder them from the perception of the
truth and from real virtue. For they say in their teaching that there are four
kinds of virtue, namely, justice, self-restraint, wisdom, and fortitude; which
things, though they are to be highly accounted, yet are exercised here below and
have their sphere upon the earth. They say, indeed, that fortitude is the
contest with fierce nature, and self-restraint the triumph over the passions,
and wisdom the distinguished government of cities, and justice right division.
And thus they ordered and arranged the world, according to that which is in the
law, and they defined wickedness on both sides. However, anything superior to
and transcending this visible scene they did not understand, nor were they able
to describe it in writing. But with the blindness of their mind they have
contracted virtue itself, and have shut it up within what is visible alone. The
Christians, however, by whose own faith the eyes of their heart have been
enlightened, whose master and teacher is the blessed Paul, have declared that to
be virtue which lifts us up to God, and which governs in orderly fashion the
things that are on earth. This most illustrious Paul, then, considered that
there were many kinds of virtue; but he especially preached about these three,
namely, faith, hope, and love. For faith gives to men something which transcends
human nature, and causes that fleshly nature, as yet encompassed by many
passions, to hold converse with spiritual beings. <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A>
For the knowledge of that which angels and spiritual hosts did not know on
account of its sublimity, faith imparts to men, who walk upon the earth and
wallow in the dust, and it brings them near to the Throne of the Kingdom, and it
tells them of that Nature which is without beginning and without end ; and by
the rays of light which it diffuses, it drives away darkness of thought<i> </i>from
the soul; and when it has cleared off all gloom and denseness from the heart,
then it causes that to be clearly seen which is comprehended in its
invisibility, and also is seen in its incomprehensibility. But hope shows things
to come in the present, not as in a dream, one can say, but forcibly; and,
without a doubt, confirms in the mind that which is future as if it were
actually seen ; and it forms before a man's eyes, so to speak, what he is still
expecting. For this hope is superior to every restraint, and brings near,
without delay, the thing expected to him who is expecting it.</p>
<p>&quot;But love is the chief of all our mysteries, for it persuaded God the
Word, though He is always on the earth, near to all and with all (heaven and
earth being filled by Him), to become incarnate and come by means of the flesh.
And, being God, He became also man; He retained that which properly belonged to
Himself on His own part, and He became like us on our part. These two then agree
together, for faith is the mirror of love, and love is the completion of faith.
We believe, therefore, that God the Word became incarnate without undergoing any
change; and we rightly so believe, for this is the foundation of our salvation.
For His nature receives no change, nor does it cause any addition to the
Trinity. Thus indeed do we also ourselves believe.</p>
<p>&quot;Every Christian, therefore, who is not rich in faith, hope, and love,
is not what he is named ; but even though he seem to have subdued his flesh and
to have delivered himself from the passions of his soul, he is not meet for the
crown of victory, inasmuch as he maintains the outward appearance of virtue, but
he is not united to Him who crowns the conquerors that have resolutely contended
on behalf of virtue in faith and <A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
hope and love. Faith, then, according to what we have said,<sup> </sup>is the
chief of all blessings; let it therefore be kept without guile, and let us not
tarnish it by the falsehood of human thoughts, neither let us toss it about in
the midst of confusing voices, nor by the explanations of those who are reputed
to be wise: for faith is not to be explained ; faith is a mystery. Let it then
remain within the limits of the Gospel of the apostles; and let no man dare to
contend in his explanation with this faith by which he is saved, and which he
confessed in baptism by the signature of his tongue. For this lofty height of
faith has repelled every attack and all vaunting and rashness, not of man only,
but also of every spiritual nature. And the blessed Paul testifies, crying out,
'If we or an angel from heaven should preach anything beside what ye have
received, let him be accursed,'<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> For the angel has
been appointed to minister and not to preach doctrine, and he brings punishment<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
upon any who does not remain in his allotted station, but seeks after what is
too high for his nature ; but even though he displays the exaltation of his
nature, let not the novelty of his preaching be received. Let us then guard what
we have received with sleepless care; and by the bright shining of our faith let
the eye of our soul be always open. But what have we received from the Divine
Scriptures except this, that God by His word created the world out of nothing
and brought the creation, which had no previous existence, into being; and made
man in His own image and likeness, and honoured him by the law of nature ; and
gave him the commandment when he was in a state of freedom ; and showed him how
to help himself, that by the choice of the good he should flee from the evil;
and the propensity of man being biassed towards the evil expelled disobedience <A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A>
from Paradise? And again, by the fathers and patriarchs, and by the Law, the
judges, and the prophets, our Creator instructed our nature, that we should keep
far away from sin, and should concern ourselves about the good and do it. And at
last when sin established its kingdom over us by our own will, because the law
of nature had been corrupted on its part,<sup><A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> </sup>and
the written law had been despised, and the prophets, after the manner of men,
brought deeds to remembrance but did not raise up our fleshly humanity from the
depth of the evils, God the Word Himself, even He who is without beginning and
without end, incomprehensible, invisible, and almighty, God the Word (I say)
came and became incarnate ; for He could be whatsoever He willed. God the Word
then, Who is one of the Trinity, became incarnate; but He became incarnate
because He so willed. And wishing to show<i> </i>everywhere that He was really
man, He was born from the Virgin. For the evangelist did not say that He entered
into a perfect man, but that He 'became flesh,' meaning thereby His natural
beginning and referring to the origin of His birth. For just as a man who is
naturally born does not come forth complete in the perfection of active power
all at once, but the seed of the nature at first becomes a body, and afterwards,
little by little, at length attains the strength of the passions and of the
whole active power; so God the Word went to meet the origin and root of the
birth. God the Word then became perfect man, and He did not take away anything
from His own unchangeable nature by the miracle which He wrought—a miracle
which did not enter into the heart of man to conceive, but which we learn by
faith and have not comprehended by investigation. And having become man, He
saved by His flesh the whole human race, and He paid the debt of sin, in that He
died as man for all men; but as God the hater of evil, He destroyed him that had
the evil power of death, that is, Satan. But He showed the capability of the Law
by fulfilling all righteousness. And He gave to our nature its pristine beauty ;
and by becoming man He honoured the nature <A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A>
which was derived from the earth, and showed Himself to be its Creator. There is
therefore one Son, for we worship the Trinity in unity, and we do not introduce
a fourth into this number; but there is one Son, begotten from the Father,
without beginning and without end, through whom we believe that the worlds were
made, He Who was from that root, He Who without flux sprang from the Father;
that same God the Word Who, without change of place, issues from the Father, yet
remaining as He is. For although He became man and appeared on the earth, yet He
did not depart from Him who begat Him.</p>
<p>&quot;God the Word therefore wished to save the being whom He created ; and
He dwelt in the womb which is the gate of the universal nature of all, and He
revived and blessed the womb, and by issuing forth from it He sealed it. And by
His supernatural birth He showed that He became incarnate in a manner
transcending reason; for there are none among the beings above and beneath who
know how He became incarnate. There is not, then, one who is Christ and another
who is God the Word (away with such a thought!), for the divine nature does not
know two sons; He therefore was begotten the only One from One; for where there
is not copulation of parents, there duality of the offspring is not possible.
'In the name of Jesus Christ,' indeed, 'every knee shall bow, of things in
heaven and on earth, and of things under the earth.'<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
For if Christ is another and not God the Word, then of necessity Christ must be
mere man ; and how can the exalted nature of heavenly beings bow the knee and
worship His Name, if He be not God of God ? or how shall we receive the voices
of prophets, crying, 'God appeared upon earth and held converse with men'? <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
For concerning His Incarnation it is said, 'He appeared,' and the expression,
'He held converse,' is used concerning His converse which He displayed with men
in the end of the ages. For thus He that is exalted in greatness showed His
almighty power; and as the universal Ruler to Whom everything is easy, He
remained what He was on His own part, and became what He willed for us. <A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But if the swaddling clothes, and the lying in the manger, and the
growth of the body, and the sleeping in the ship, and the weariness on the
journey, and the occasional hunger, and all those things which happened to Him
Who was truly man, be a cause of stumbling to some persons, let them know that
if they be in doubt concerning His sufferings, they deny the dispensation; but
when they deny the dispensation they do not believe in the Incarnation, but when
they do not believe in the Incarnation they lose their own lives. For if from
the foundation of the world a man was not born who trod a way of birth like
this, let these new Jewish wranglers<sup> </sup>show it, and then indeed their
troublesome contention will be disclosed. But if this is the universal beginning
of nature, and God the Word truly became man, how then, while confessing with us
the dispensation, do they deny the sufferings ? Let them therefore choose for
themselves one of two things: either let them by denying the sufferings deny
also the dispensation and be reckoned among the ungodly; or, if they accept the
benefit which is derived from the dispensation, let them not be ashamed of the
sufferings. I am amazed indeed at the blindness of their heart, who by a newly
invented way have trodden the path that leads to error. For I myself know and
have rightly learned from the Holy Scriptures only one Son ; and I believe in
one nature of God the Word Who became man, and the same endured the sufferings
and wrought the miracles, Who was begotten from His Father before all things,
and became incarnate in the end of the ages, and was born from Mary, the <i>Theotokos.
</i>And we confess that He is God over all, and we introduce no foreign element
into the nature of the Deity, for no addition is possible to the Trinity in
Unity; but the same Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom were all things, also endured our
sufferings and carried our infirmities, <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A>
as the prophet <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> says; and He, being the same,
wrought the miracles and suffered in our stead.</p>
<p>&quot;But perhaps in their contention these new Jews will strive with us,
inventing thoughts weaker than a spider's web, and say that if indeed the
Trinity be one essence then the Trinity is without suffering; and our Lord Jesus
Christ is reckoned in the Trinity, and He is God the Word, therefore He is
without suffering; consequently He Who was crucified must be another, and not
God the Word Who is without suffering. Truly they who speak in this fashion are
weaving the texture of a spider's web, and they who excogitate these new
definitions are writing upon water; and 'thinking themselves to be wise they
have become foolish, and their silly heart is darkened.'<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
For the eye, which has been dazzled by the brilliant light of the sun, cannot
see clearly; and the mind that is sick cannot receive the sublimity of the
faith.</p>
<p>&quot;What then do we say ? That, so far as the Godhead is concerned, the
Trinity is one essence, and is exalted above all sufferings. And when we say
that the Son suffered, we do not mean that He suffered according to Nature, for
His Nature is above sufferings. But in confessing that God the Word, one of the
Trinity, became incarnate, we give a reason for the understanding of those who
in faith ask us why He became incarnate. Because man who was formed in the image
of God, and to whom imperial freedom was given, erred in this freedom, and was
led by the counsel of the deceiver; and he gave himself up to error, and he
became the slave of lustful passions—passions all of which exercise dominion
over a composite being—passions whose end is death—passions which none among
the created beings is able to destroy. God the Word willed to destroy those
passions whose end is death. He willed, indeed, to become incarnate and to be a
composite being ; that is, a perfect man in all points like us, sin only
excepted; because it was not possible for that Nature, which is incorruptible,
intangible, and invisible, to receive passions, for all passions are struggles
of all composite <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A> beings. For with
that exalted Nature of the Godhead, which alone is uplifted high above all
things, there is no composition ; passion therefore was unable to enter where
composition could not be. God the Word then willed to destroy the passions which
reign over nature subject to passions (as we said before) whose citadel was
death; and He became flesh from the Virgin, in a manner that He, God the Word,
knew; and He became man perfectly, being at the same time God over all. For He
did not abandon what properly belonged to Him when He became like us; but being
God, He became man, for such was His will. He emptied Himself, therefore, by His
own will by taking the likeness of a slave, and He became man, and suffered in
our stead, by His own will, though His Godhead was not in any respect limited;
and thus He saved the whole human race. Wherefore Gabriel also, when announcing
the might and dominion of Him that should be born, said to Mary, 'He shall save
His people from their sins.'<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;But the people are not the people of a man but of God, and a man cannot
deliver the world from sins, because he also entered into the world in a state
of corruption. But necessarily He is the same ; He is not divided into two (away
with such a thought!) ; but being one, by being born from a woman, He shows that
He is truly man ; but by becoming man without copulation, and preserving His
mother's virginity, He declared Himself to be God. The Lord Jesus Christ,
therefore, Who came into the world and held converse with men, as the Holy
Scriptures testify, saved the world. Now, if Christ be man, and not God the
Word, how did He create everything in the beginning, when He Himself had no
existence ? For if man was later than the (other) created things, it is evident
that this Christ also did not bring into being what had existence before Him.
How then does Paul cry, saying, 'There is one Lord Christ, through Whom were all
things'?<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> For if all things were through Christ,
it is evident that Christ is God the Word. The evangelist also testifies,
saying, 'In the beginning was the Word, and <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A>
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God,
and all things were by Him.' <sup><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> </sup>If,
therefore, the evangelist cries that all things were by the Word, and Paul,
interpreting this expression, says, There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom were
all things, it is evident that Christ is God over all. But if the objectors
bring forward to us the voices of the Scriptures, in which He is called man,
namely, that of Peter, who says, 'Jesus of Nazareth, a man';<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
and of Paul, who says, 'By that man in Whom God has ordained that we should
believe';<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> and of our Lord Himself, Who says
respecting Himself, 'Why do ye seek to kill Me, a man?'<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
let them know that either through their dulness they have been hindered from the
understanding of Scripture, or through their wickedness they are perverting what
is well written, according to their own deceitfulness. For also Christ is truly
man ; but He became man, not having been so before, but only God ; for just as
He is uncreated God, so also He, the same, is man, truly, personally, and
certainly, without change and without any kind of phantasy. And we do not
confess that the body of our Lord is from heaven ; indeed we excommunicate
everyone who says so; but we confess that it is by the Holy Ghost and the power
of the Highest which overshadowed the holy Virgin Mary, the <i>Theotokos. </i>But
if the Virgin did not bear God, then she who remained undefiled is not deserving
of admiration. But if the voices of the prophets foretelling the
incomprehensible nature of our mystery, cried out, 'Behold a virgin shall
conceive, and bear a son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which is, God
with us,' <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> why <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A>
do they take away from the glory of His mother, seeing that He Who was born in
lowly fashion is God over all ?<i> </i>But perhaps the objectors will raise this
objection, that truly every one who is born is of the same nature as the mother
who bore him ; if, then, she who bore him was human, it necessarily follows that
he who was born was human also. Ye say well, O vain babblers ! but then the
child is of the same nature as she whom the birth-pangs smite when he who is
born comes according to the natural course; however, the naturally-born child is
corrupt from the beginning, because copulation precedes corruption. But where
this reproach did not even enter the mind, but there was an ineffable miracle,
the birth having been supernatural, there He that was born was God. We confess
Him to be the same who created the world, and gave the Law, and put the Spirit
in the prophets, and in the end of the times for the sake of the life and
salvation of men became incarnate and was made man ; and He inspired the
apostles, and sent them forth for the salvation of people and nations. Let us
flee, then, my brothers, from these troubled streams of error; I mean the
doctrines that fight against God—namely, from the mad folly of Arius, who was
dividing the indivisible Trinity; and from the rashness of Eunomius, who limited
beneath his science the incomprehensible nature; and from the frenzy of
Macedonius, who would sever from the Godhead the Spirit proceeding not
departing;<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> along with all the other heretics lost
in their error; but especially from this new doctrine and blasphemy formulated
by Nestorius, who far surpasses the Jews in his blasphemy. For those former
heretics were despising the everlasting Son, Who is from all eternity with the
Father, and depriving the root of its fruit; but these teachers of our day by
their doctrine are bringing in another in addition to Him Who is from all
eternity, Who became man for our salvation, so that they make a plurality of
sons in that one and incorruptible Nature which is from one essence. <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A>
Let us say, then, with Paul, that Christ is He Who ' made both one'; <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A><i>
</i>for of Jews and heathen through baptism, He has created one new man, and by
His power He made that one, which, through the exercise of its freedom was
divided. Let these impious teachers, then, dread the sentence of judgment if
what was divided has been brought into unity, but that one Person Who made both
one is, after their manner of reasoning, divided.</p>
<p>&quot;But now we shall leave the multitude of words and come to the concise
statement of true doctrine. Whoever desires to know that the alone and
only-begotten Son, Who was before the life of Abraham—that the same became
incarnate in the end of the times, let him ask Paul, who thunders with his
voice, declaring rightly that He Who was born from the Jews in the flesh is the
everlasting God ; for, while telling and declaring the contempt of the Jews and
the contention of the people with God, and the root which is the Father, and the
seed which is Christ our Lord, he says thus, 'Whose is the adoption'<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>—for
God cried through His prophets, 'Israel is My son; My firstborn and My glory';<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
and indeed they reaped immeasurable glories from the constant miracles and the
covenants with Abraham, which told of the multitude of the people and the
blessings—'and the. giving of the law,'—that of Mount Sinai, which was
written by the finger of God,— 'and the promises,'—both the land of
Palestine and that in the seed of Abraham the nations should be
blessed,—'whose are the fathers,'—for in the night of error they arose and
as stars of the,faith—'from whom Jesus Christ appeared in the flesh, Who is
God over all.' And he does not say this only and deem it sufficient; for also
indeed the beginning of God the Word, Who is without beginning and without end,
is not from the time of His birth by Mary. Who then is this Christ? He Who was
begotten of the Father before the worlds in a manner which the mind of created
beings cannot comprehend, and in the end of the times took flesh and became <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A>
man from the Virgin Mary, the <i>Theotokos</i>; He Who was shut up in the womb
and in the cave, in a manner which He Himself knows ; He Who was laid in the
manger; He Who grew in the flesh ; He Who came down to the lower parts of the
earth, and by His own will endured all the sufferings of men, that He might be
believed to be man, and to be no other than the One Who came down ; but He Who
came down and He Who went up is the same; however, He did not go up first, but
came down. For He did not become God by addition (away with such a thought!),
but He became man by the dispensation, for the race of men was in need of this.
And you shall not hear this from me or from any other, but from Peter and from
Paul—Peter when he says, 'Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God'; <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A><i>
</i>and Paul also, who learned by revelation from the Father concerning the Son,
and says, 'When God Who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His
grace, was pleased to reveal His Son by my means.' <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
This Paul has truly taught you who Jesus Christ is when he cries and says, 'Of
whom is Christ in the flesh, Who is God over all, blessed for ever.' <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
What occasion of calumny does not the word of Peter and Paul drive away from
those who love calumny! for he called Him 'Christ' to show that He truly became
man ; he said of Him, 'Who is of the Jews in the flesh,' to show that His
existence does not date only from the time when He became incarnate; he said of
Him, 'He is,' to tell us by his mode of expression that He is without beginning;
he said of Him, 'Who is over all,' to proclaim Him Lord of created things; he
said of Him, 'Who is God,' that we should not be drawn aside by the outward
appearance and sufferings so as to deny his incorruptible Nature; he said of
Him, 'blessed,' that we should worship Him as the Ruler of all, and not regard
Him as a&nbsp; <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A> fellow-slave; he said
of Him, 'Who is for ever,' to show that it is He Who by His word created all
things, visible and invisible, whereby His Godhead is glorified. We have, then,
Christ Who is God over all, Whom we shall worship, and we shall say to the
heretics, 'In whomsoever the Spirit of Christ is not, he is none of His.' For we
have the mind of Christ, and therefore we look for the revelation of God our
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, Who Himself shall reward the well-doers with the
crown of victory, but the despisers with the recompense of their rashness. See,
then, my brothers, that no man rob you by impious words, or turn you aside by
false science from the simplicity and unadorned modesty of the pure beauty of
the faith. But again, I repeat to you the word of Paul, 'Beware lest any man rob
you by the vain philosophy of the traditions of men'<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>—men
who are inventors of vain things, who have not taught us as the prophets and
apostles teach, but have gone astray by their own wisdom and followed the
interpretation of their own mind; wherefore their teaching is a stumbling-block
to the Church of God, which He purchased with His precious blood. For other
foundation of the true faith can no man lay except that which is laid, that
there is one God, the Father, Ruler of all, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom
were all things, Who is from all eternity with the Father, from Him and of the
same Nature with Him ; and one Holy Spirit, the Lord and Life-giver, Who
proceeds from the Father, and together with the Father and the Son is worshipped
and glorified. Stand, then, in one spirit and one mind, and fight for the faith,
and be not in anything troubled by the adversaries, but keep the tradition which
you have received from the blessed Fathers, who,<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
out of the whole creation, met together by the operation of the Holy Spirit, and
preached to us the true and undefiled faith, which we have from one end of the
earth to the other.&quot;</p>
<p>The end of the letter which the blessed Proclus, bishop of <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>
Constantinople, wrote to Great Armenia of the Persians, concerning the true
faith.</p>
<p>But<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Theodosius lived, as the Chronicle informs
us, fifty years ; of these he reigned forty-two years, for he was eight years
old when he began to reign. And the acts of thirty-two years of his reign are
related in the ecclesiastical history of Socrates, and those of the other ten
years more are written concisely above in this second Book. He died then in the
three hundred and eighth Olympiad ; and Marcian succeeded him in the kingdom.
And in the year seven hundred and sixty-four by the reckoning of the Greek era
of Alexander, he gathered to Chalcedon a Synod of five hundred and sixty-seven
bishops, whose acts we shall describe as concisely as possible in this third
Book which is written below, and in its chapters, which have been taken for the
most part from the history of Zachariah the Rhetorician, which he wrote in Greek
to a man called Eupraxius, who lived in the royal palace and was engaged in the
service of kings. But the body of the holy John the bishop, who is called
Chrysostom, had been brought back from the place of his banishment, and it was
honoured with a procession in Constantinople. And Eudocia the queen, the wife of
Theodosius, went to Jerusalem for prayer, and returned, and then died. But
Geiseric subdued Carthage of Africa and reigned over it. And John the general
was killed by the servants of Arbindus,<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> and there
were earthquakes in various places. And then Theodosius died.&nbsp;</p>
