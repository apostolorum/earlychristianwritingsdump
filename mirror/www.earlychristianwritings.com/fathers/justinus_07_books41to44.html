</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b>THE Parthians, in whose hands the empire of the east now is, having
divided the world, as it were, with the Romans, were originally exiles from
Scythia. This is apparent from their very name; for in the Scythian language
exiles are called <i>Parthi. </i>During the time of the Assyrians and Medes,
they were the most obscure of all the people of the east. Subsequently, too,
when the empire of the east was transferred from the Medes to the Persians, they
were but as a herd without a name, and fell under the power of the stronger. At
last they became subject to the Macedonians, when they conquered the east; so
that it must seem wonderful to every one, that they should have reached such a
height of good fortune as to rule over those nations under whose sway they had
been merely slaves. Being assailed by the Romans, also, in three wars, under the
conduct of the greatest generals, and at the most flourishing period of the
republic, they alone, of all nations, were not only a match for them, but came
off victorious; though it may have been a greater glory to them, indeed, to have
been able to rise amidst the Assyrian, Median, and Persian empires, so
celebrated of old, and the most powerful dominion of Bactria, peopled with a
thousand cities, than to have been victorious in war against a people that came
from a distance; especially when they were continually harassed by severe wars
with the Scythians and other neighbouring nations, and pressed with various
other formidable contests.</p>
<p>The Parthians, being forced to quit Scythia by discord at home, gradually
settled in the deserts betwixt Hyrcania, the Dahae, the Arei, the Sparni <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
and Marsiani. They then advanced their borders, though their neighbours, who at
first made no opposition, at length endeavoured to prevent them, <A NAME="p273"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|273</SPAN></A>
to such an extent, that they not only got possession of the vast level plains,
but also of steep hills, and heights of the mountains; and hence it is that an
excess of heat or cold prevails in most parts of the Parthian territories; since
the snow is troublesome on the higher grounds, and the heat in the plains.</p>
<p><b>II. </b>The government of the nation, after their revolt from the
Macedonian power, was in the hands of kings. Next to the royal authority is the
order of the people,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> from which they take generals
in war and magistrates in peace. Their language is something between those of
the Scythians and Medes, being a compound of both. Their dress was formerly of a
fashion peculiar to themselves; afterwards, when their power had increased, it
was like that of the Medes, light and full flowing. The fashion of their arms is
that of their own country and of Scythia.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> They have
an army, not like other nations, of free men, but chiefly consisting of slaves,
the numbers of whom daily increase, the power of manumission being allowed to
none, and all their offspring, in consequence, being born slaves. These bondmen
they bring up as carefully as their own children, and teach them, with great
pains, the arts of riding and shooting with the bow. As any one is eminent in
wealth, so he furnishes the king with a proportionate number of horsemen for
war. Indeed when fifty thousand cavalry encountered Antony, as he was making war
upon Parthia, only four hundred of them were free men.</p>
<p>Of engaging with the enemy in close fight, and of taking cities by siege,
they know nothing. They fight on horseback, either galloping forward or turning
their backs. Often, too, they counterfeit flight, that they may throw their
pursuers off their guard against being wounded by their arrows. The signal for
battle among them is given, not by trumpet, but by drum. Nor are they able to
fight long: but they would be irresistible, if their vigour and perseverance
were equal to the fury of their onset. In general they retire before the enemy
in the very heat of the engagement, and, soon after their <A NAME="p274"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|274</SPAN></A>
retreat, return to the battle afresh; so that, when you feel most certain that
you have conquered them, you have still to meet the greatest danger from them.
Their armour, and that of their horses, is formed of plates, lapping over one
another like the feathers of a bird, and covers both man and horse entirely.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
Of gold and silver, except for adorning their arms, they make no use.</p>
<p><b>III. </b>Each man has several wives, for the sake of gratifying desire
with different objects. They punish no crime more severely than adultery, and
accordingly they not only exclude their women from entertainments, but forbid
them the very sight of men. They eat no flesh but that which they take in
hunting. They ride on horseback on all occasions; on horses they go to war, and
to feasts; on horses they discharge public and private duties; on horses they go
abroad, meet together, traffic, and converse. Indeed the difference between
slaves and freemen is, that slaves go on foot, but freemen only on horseback.
Their general mode of sepulture is dilaniation by birds or dogs; the bare bones
they at last bury in the ground.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> In their
superstitions and worship of the gods, the principal veneration is paid to
rivers. The disposition of the people is proud, quarrelsome, faithless, and
insolent; for a certain roughness of behaviour they think becoming to men, and
gentleness only to women. They are always restless, and ready for any commotion,
at home or abroad; taciturn by nature; more ready to act than speak, and
consequently shrouding both their successes and miscarriages in silence. They
obey their princes, not from humility, but from fear. They are libidinous, but
frugal in diet. To their word or promise they have no regard, except as far as
suits their interest.</p>
<p><b>IV. </b>After the death of Alexander the Great, when the kingdoms of the
east were divided among his successors, the government of Parthia was committed
to Stasanor, a foreign <A NAME="p275"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|275</SPAN></A> ally,
because none of the Macedonians would deign to accept it. Subsequently, when the
Macedonians were divided into parties by civil discord, the Parthians, with the
other people of Upper Asia, followed Eumenes, and, when he was defeated, went
over to Antigonus. After his death they were under the rule of Seleucus Nicator,
and then under Antiochus and his successors, from whose great-grandson Seleucus
they first revolted, in the first Punic war, when Lucius Manlius Vulso and
Marcus Attilius Regulus were consuls. For their revolt, the dispute between the
two brothers, Seleucus and Antiochus, procured them impunity; for while they
sought to wrest the throne from one another, they neglected to pursue the
revolters.</p>
<p>At the same period, also, Theodotus, governor of the thousand cities of
Bactria, revolted, and assumed the title of king; and all the other people of
the east, influenced by his example, fell away from the Macedonians. One
Arsaces, a man of uncertain origin, but of undisputed bravery, happened to arise
at this time; and he, who was accustomed to live by plunder and depredations,
hearing a report that Seleucus was overcome by the Gauls in Asia, and being
consequently freed from dread of that prince, invaded Parthia with a band of
marauders, overthrew Andragoras his lieutenant, and, after putting him to death,
took upon himself the government of the country. Not long after, too, he made
himself master of Hyrcania, and thus, invested with authority over two nations,
raised a large army, through fear of Seleucus and Theodotus, king of the
Bactrians. But being soon relieved of his fears by the death of Theodotus, he
made peace and an alliance with his son, who was also named Theodotus; and not
long after, engaging with king Seleucus, who came to take vengeance on the
revolters, he obtained a victory; and the Parthians observe the day on which it
was gained with great solemnity, as the date of the commencement of their
liberty.</p>
<p><b>V. </b>Seleucus being then recalled into Asia by new disturbances, and
respite being thus given to Arsaces, he settled the Parthian government, levied
soldiers, built fortresses, and strengthened his towns. He founded a city also,
called Dara, in Mount Zapaortenon, of which the situation is such, that no place
can be more secure or more pleasant; for it is so encircled with steep rocks,
that the strength of its position needs no defenders; and such is the fertility
of the adjacent <A NAME="p276"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|276</SPAN></A> soil, that it is
stored with its own produce. Such too is the plenty of springs and wood, that it
is amply supplied with streams of water, and abounds with all the pleasures of
the chace. Thus Arsaces, having at once acquired and established a kingdom, and
having become no less memorable among the Parthians than Cyrus among the
Persians, Alexander among the Macedonians, or Romulus among the Romans, died at
a mature old age; and the Parthians paid this honour to his memory, that they
called all their kings thenceforward by the name of Arsaces. His son and
successor on the throne, whose name was also Arsaces, fought with the greatest
bravery against Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, who was at the head of a hundred
thousand foot and twenty thousand horse, and was at last taken into alliance
with him. The third king of the Parthians was Priapatius; but he was also called
Arsaces, for, as has just been observed, they distinguished all their kings by
that name, as the Romans use the titles of Caesar and Augustus. He, after
reigning fifteen years, died, leaving two sons, Mithridates and Phraates, of
whom the elder, Phraates, being, according to the custom of the nation, heir to
the crown, subdued the Mardi, a strong people, by force of arms, and died not
long after, leaving several sons, whom he set aside, and left the throne, in
preference, to his brother Mithridates, a man of extraordinary ability, thinking
that more was due to the name of king than to that of father, and that he ought
to consult the interests of his country rather than those of his children.</p>
<p><b>VI. </b>Almost at the same time that Mithridates ascended the throne among
the Parthians, Eucratides began to reign among the Bactrians; both of them being
great men. But the fortune of the Parthians, being the more successful, raised
them, under this prince, to the highest degree of power; while the Bactrians,
harassed with various wars, lost not only their dominions, but their liberty;
for having suffered from contentions with the Sogdians, the Drangians, and the
Indians, they were at last overcome, as if exhausted, by the weaker <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
Parthians. Eucratides, however, carried on several wars with great spirit, and
though much reduced by his losses in them, <A NAME="p277"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|277</SPAN></A>
yet, when he was besieged by Demetrius king of the Indians, with a garrison of
only three hundred soldiers, he repulsed, by continual sallies, a force of sixty
thousand enemies.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><sup>&nbsp;</sup> Having
accordingly escaped, after a five months' siege, he reduced India under his
power. But as he was returning from the country, he was killed on his march by
his son, with whom he had shared his throne, and who was so far from concealing
the murder, that, as if he had killed an enemy, and not his father, he drove his
chariot through his blood, and ordered his body to be cast out unburied.</p>
<p>During the course of these proceedings among the Bactrians, a war arose
between the Parthians and Medes, and after fortune on each side had been some
time fluctuating, victory at length fell to the Parthians; when Mithridates,
enforced with this addition to his power, appointed Bacasis over Media, while he
himself marched into Hyrcania. On his return from thence, he went to war with
the king of the Elymaeans, and having conquered him, added this nation also to
his dominions, and extended the Parthian empire, by reducing many other tribes
under his yoke, from Mount Caucasus to the river Euphrates. Being then taken
ill, he died in an honourable old age, and not inferior in merit to his
great-grandfather Arsaces.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b>AFTER the death of Mithridates, king of the Parthians, Phraates his
son was made king, who, having proceeded to make war upon Syria, in revenge for
the attempts of Antiochus on the Parthian dominions, was recalled, by
hostilities on the part of the Scythians, to defend his own country. For the
Scythians, having been induced, by the offer of pay, to assist the Parthians
against, Antiochus king of Syria, and not having <A NAME="p278"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|278</SPAN></A>
arrived till the war was ended, were disappointed of the expected remuneration,
and reproached with having brought their aid too late; and when, in discontent
at having made so long a march in vain, they demanded that &quot;either some
recompence for their trouble, or another enemy to attack, should be assigned
them,&quot; being offended at the haughty reply which they received, they began
to ravage the country of the Parthians. Phraates, in consequence, marching
against them, left a certain Himerus, who had gained his favours in the bloom of
youth, to take care of his kingdom. But Himerus, unmindful both of his past
life, and of the duty with which he was entrusted, miserably harassed the people
of Babylon, and many other cities, with tyrannical cruelties. Phraates himself,
meanwhile, took with him to the war a body of Greeks, who had been made
prisoners in the war against Antiochus, and whom he had treated with great pride
and severity, not reflecting that captivity had not lessened their hostile
feelings, and that the indignity of the outrages which they had suffered must
have exasperated them. As soon therefore as they saw the Persians giving ground,
they went over to the enemy, and executed that revenge for their captivity,
which they had long desired, by a sanguinary destruction of the Parthian army
and of king Phraates himself.</p>
<p><b>II. </b>In his stead Artabanus, his uncle, was made king. The Scythians,
content with their victory, and with having laid waste Parthia, returned home.
Artabanus, making war upon the Thogarii, received a wound in the arm, of which
he immediately died. He was succeeded by his son Mithridates, to whom his
achievements procured the surname of Great; for, being fired with a desire to
emulate the merit of his ancestors, he was enabled by the vast powers of his
mind to surpass their renown. He carried on many wars, with great bravery,
against his neighbours, and added many provinces to the Parthian kingdom. He
fought successfully, too, several times, against the Scythians, and avenged the
injuries received from them by his forefathers. At last he turned his arms
against Ortoadistes,<sup><A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></sup> king of Armenia.</p>
<p>But since we here make a transition to Armenia, we must look a little farther
back into its origin; for it is not right that so great a kingdom should be
passed in silence, since its territory, <A NAME="p279"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|279</SPAN></A>
next to that of Parthia, is of greater extent than any other kingdom. Armenia,
from Cappadocia to the Caspian Sea, stretches over a space of eleven hundred
miles, and is seven hundred miles in breadth. It was founded by Armenius, the
companion of Jason of Thessaly, whom King Pelias, wishing to procure his death
from dread of his extraordinary ability, which was dangerous to his throne,
despatched on a prescribed expedition to Colchis, to bring home the fleece of
the ram so celebrated throughout the world; hoping that the man would lose his
life, either in the perils of so long a voyage, or in war with barbarians so
remote. But Jason, having spread abroad the report of so glorious an enterprise,
at which the chief of the youth from almost all the world <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
came flocking to him, collected a band of heroes, who were called Argonauts.
Having brought his troop back safe, and being again driven from Thesssaly by the
sons of Pelias, he set out on a second voyage for Colchis, accompanied by a
numerous train of followers (who, at the fame of his valour, came daily from all
parts to join him), by his wife Medea, whom, having previously divorced her, he
had now received again from compassion for her exile, and by his step-son Medus,
whom she had by Aegeus king of the Athenians; and he re-established his
father-in-law Aeetes <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> who had been driven from
his throne.</p>
<p><b>III. </b>He then carried on great wars with the neighbouring nations; and
of the cities which he took, he added part to the kingdom of his father-in-law,
to make amends for the injury that he had done him in his former expedition, in
which he had carried off his daughter Medea and put to death his son Aegialeus, <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
and part he assigned to the people that he had brought with him; and he is said
to have been the first of mankind, after Hercules and Bacchus (whom tradition
declares to have been kings of the east), that subdued that quarter of the
world. Over some of these nations he appointed Recas and Amphistratus, the
charioteers of Castor and Pollux, to be their rulers. With the Albanians he
formed an alliance, a people who are said to have followed Hercules out of
Italy, from the Alban <A NAME="p280"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|280</SPAN></A> mount, when,
after having killed Geryon, he was driving his herds through Italy, and who,
remembering their Italian descent, saluted the soldiers of Pompey in the
Mithridatic war as their brothers. Hence almost the whole east appointed divine
honours, and erected temples, to Jason, as their founder; temples which
Parmenio, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, caused many years after to
be pulled down, that no name might be more venerated in the east than that of
Alexander After the death of Jason, Medus, emulous of his virtues, built a city
named Medea in honour of his mother, and established the kingdom of the Medes
after his own name, under whose dominion the empire of the east afterwards fell.
On the Albanians border the Amazons, whose queen Thalestris, as many authors
relate, sought the couch of Alexander. Armenius, too, who was himself a
Thessalian, and one of the captains of Jason, having re-assembled a body of men,
who, after the death of Jason were wandering about, founded Armenia, from the
mountains of which the river Tigris issues, at first with a very small stream,
out after running some distance, is lost in the earth, and then, flowing five
and twenty miles underground,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> rises up a great
river in the province of Sophene; and thus it is received into the marshes of
the Euphrates.</p>
<p><b>IV. </b>Mithridates king of the Parthians, after his war with Armenia, was
banished from his kingdom for his cruelty by the Parthian seriate. His brother
Orodes, who took possession of the vacant throne, besieged Babylon, whither
Mithridates had fled, for some time, and reduced the people, under the influence
of famine, to surrender. Mithridates, from confidence in his relationship to
Orodes, voluntarily put himself into his hands; but Orodes, contemplating him
rather as an enemy than a brother, ordered him to be put to death before his
face. After this, he carried on a war with the Romans, and overthrew their
general Crassus, together with his son and all the Roman army. His son Pacorus,
who was sent to pursue what remained of the Roman forces, after achieving great
actions in Syria, incurred some jealousy on the part of his father, and was
recalled into Parthia; and during his absence the Parthian army left in Syria
was cut off, with all its commanders, by <A NAME="p281"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|281</SPAN></A>
Cassius the quaestor of Crassus. Not long after these occurrences the civil war
among the Romans, between Caesar and Pompey, broke out, in which the Parthians
took the side of Pompey, both from the friendship that they had formed with him
in the Mithridatic war, and because of the death of Crassus, whose son they
understood to be of Caesar's party, and supposed that, if Caesar were
victorious, he would avenge his father's fate. When Pompey's party was worsted,
they sent assistance to Cassius and Brutus against Augustus and Antony; and,
after the war was ended, they made an alliance with Labienus, and, under the
leadership of Pacorus, again laid waste Syria and Asia, and assailed, with a
vast force, the camp of Ventidius, who, like Cassius before him, had routed the
Parthian army in the absence of Pacorus. Ventidius, pretending to be afraid,
kept himself a long time in his camp, and suffered the Parthians to insult him.
At last, however, when they were full of security and exultation, he sent out
part of his legions upon them, and the Parthians, put to flight by their onset,
went off in several directions; when Pacorus, supposing that his fugitive troops
had drawn off all the Roman forces in pursuit of them, attacked Ventidius's
camp, as if it had been left without defenders. Upon this, Ventidius, pouring
forth the rest of his troops, put the whole force of the Parthians, with their
king Pacorus, to the sword; nor did the Parthians, in any war, ever suffer a
greater slaughter.</p>
<p>When the news of this discomfiture reached Parthia, Orodes, the father of
Pacorus, who had just before heard that Syria had been ravaged, and Asia
occupied by his Parthians, and was boasting of his son Pacorus as the conqueror
of the Romans, was affected, on hearing of the death of his son and the
destruction of his army, at first with grief, and afterwards with disorder of
the intellect. For several days he neither spoke to any one, nor took food, nor
uttered a sound, so that he seemed to have become dumb. Some time after, when
his sorrow found vent in words, he did nothing but call upon Pacorus; Pacorus
seemed to be seen and heard by him; Pacorus appeared to talk with him, and stand
by him; though at other times he mourned and wept for him as lost. After long
indulgence in grief, another cause of concern troubled the unhappy old man, as
he had to determine which of his thirty sons he should choose for his successor
in the room of Pacorus. His numerous concubines, from whom so large a progeny
had sprung, were perpetually working <A NAME="p282"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|282</SPAN></A>
on the old man's feelings, each anxious for her own offspring, But the fate of
Parthia, in which it is now, as it were, customary that the princes should be
assassins of their kindred; ordained that the most cruel of them all, Phraates
by name should be fixed upon for their king.</p>
<p><b>V. </b>Phraates immediately proceeded to kill his father, as if he would
not die, and put to death, also, all his thirty <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
brothers. But his murders did not end with his father's sons; for finding that
the nobility began to detest him for his constant barbarities, he caused his own
son, who was grown up, to be killed, that there might be no one to be nominated
king. On this prince Antony made war, with sixteen effective legions, for having
sent troops against him and Caesar; but being severely harassed in several
engagements, he was forced to retreat from Parthia. Phraates, upon this success,
becoming still more insolent, and being guilty of many fresh acts of cruelty,
was driven into exile by his subjects. Having then, for a long time, wearied the
neighbouring people, and at last the Scythians, with entreaties for aid, he was
at last restored to his throne by a powerful Scythian force. During his absence,
the Parthians had made one Tiridates king, who, when he heard of the approach of
the Scythians, fled with a great body of his partisans to Caesar,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
who was then carrying on war in Spain,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> taking
with him, as a hostage for Caesar, the youngest son of Phraates, whom, being but
negligently guarded, he had secretly carried off. Phraates, on hearing of his
flight, immediately sent ambassadors to Caesar, requesting that &quot;his slave
Tiridates, and his son, should be restored to him.&quot; Caesar, after listening
to the embassy of Phraates, and deliberating on the application of Tiridates
(for he also had asked to be restored to his throne, saying that &quot;Parthia
would be wholly in the power of the Romans, if he should hold the kingdom as a
gift from them&quot;), replied, that &quot;he would neither give up Tiridates to
the Parthians, nor give assistance to Tiridates against the Parthians.&quot;
That it might not appear, however, that nothing had been obtained from Caesar by
all <A NAME="p283"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|283</SPAN></A> their applications, he sent
back to Phraates his son without ransom, and ordered a handsome maintenance to
be furnished to Tiridates, as long as he chose to continue among the Romans.
Some time after, when Caesar had finished the Spanish war, and had proceeded to
Syria to settle the affairs of the east, he caused some alarm to Phraates, who
was afraid that he might contemplate an invasion of Parthia. Whatever prisoners,
accordingly, remained of the army of Crassus or Antony throughout, Parthia, were
collected together, and sent, with the military standards that had been taken,
to Augustus. In addition to this, the sons and grandsons of Phraates were
delivered to Augustus as hostages; and thus Caesar effected more by the power of
his name, than any other general could have done by his arms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b>HAVING narrated the history of the Parthians and other eastern
nations, and of almost the whole world, Trogus returns home, as if after a long
journey in foreign parts, to relate the rise of the city of Rome, thinking it
would be the mark of an ungrateful citizen, if, after he had set forth the acts
of other nations, he should be silent concerning his native country alone. He
therefore briefly touches on the origin of the Roman empire, so as neither to
exceed the bounds of the work that he had proposed, nor to pass unnoticed the
origin of a city which is now the mistress of the world.</p>
<p>The first inhabitants of Italy were the Aborigines, whose king, Saturn, is
said to have been a man of such extraordinary justice, that no one was a slave
in his reign, or had any private property, but all things were common to all,
and undivided, as one estate for the use of every one; in memory of which way of
life, it has been ordered that at the Saturnalia slaves should everywhere sit
down with their masters at the entertainments, the rank of all being made equal.
Italy was accordingly <A NAME="p284"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|284</SPAN></A> called, from
the name of that king, Saturnia; and the hill on which he dwelt Saturnius, on
which now stands the Capitol, as if Saturn had been dislodged from his seat by
Jupiter. After him, third in descent, they say that Faunus was king, in whose
time Evander came into Italy from Pallanteum, a city of Arcadia, accompanied
with a small band of his countrymen, to whom Faunus kindly gave land, and the
mountain which he afterwards called Palatium. At the foot of this mountain he
built a temple to the Lycaean god, whom the Greeks call Pan, and the Romans
Lupercus,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> the naked statue of the deity being
covered with a goat-skin, in which dress the priests now run up and down during
the Lupercalia at Rome. This Faunus had a wife named Fatua, who, being
constantly filled with a spirit of divination, gave notice, in fits of frenzy as
it were, of things to come; and hence, to this day, those who are accustomed to
be thus inspired, are said <i>fatuari.</i><A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> Of an
illicit connection between a daughter of Faunus and Hercules, (who, having
killed Geryon about that time, was driving his herds, the prize of his victory,
through Italy), was born Latinus, in whose reign Aeneas came from Ilium <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
into Italy, after the destruction of Troy by the Greeks, and being immediately
received with hostile demonstrations, led out his troops into the field, but
being first invited to a conference, raised such admiration of himself in
Latinus, that he was both admitted to a share of his throne, and became his
son-in-law by a marriage with his daughter Lavinia. After this event, they had
to carry on war in concert against Turnus, king of the Rutulians, because he had
been disappointed of marrying Lavinia; and in the war both Turnus and Latinus
were killed, Aeneas, in consequence, becoming by right of victory master of both
nations, built a city which he called Lavinium, from the name of his wife. Some
time afterwards, he went to war with Mezentius, king of the Etrurians, and being
killed in it, Ascanius his son succeeded him, who, removing from <A NAME="p285"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|285</SPAN></A>
Lavinium, built Alba Longa, which for three hundred years was the metropolis of
his kingdom.</p>
<p><b>II. </b>At length, after many kings had reigned in this city, Numitor and
Amulius became joint sovereigns. But Amulius, having deprived Numitor, who was
the elder, of his share of the throne, condemned his daughter Rhea to perpetual
virginity, that no male offspring of Numitor's family might arise to claim the
crown, palliating the injury by an appearance of honour, so that she might not
seem to have been compelled, but to have been chosen one of the vestal virgins.
Being shut up, accordingly, in a grove sacred to Mars, she gave birth to two
boys, whether the offspring of an illicit connexion with a mortal, or of the god
Mars, is uncertain. This affair becoming known, Amulius, whose fears were
increased by the birth of twins, ordered the children to be exposed, and threw
his niece into prison, of which ill-treatment she died. Fortune, however, having
a care for the raising of Rome, threw the children in the way of a she-wolf to
be suckled, which, having lost her cubs, and longing to empty her overcharged
teats, offered herself as a nurse to the infants. As she made frequent returns
to the children, as if they had been her own offspring, Faustulus, a shepherd,
observed her proceedings, and, withdrawing them from the beast, brought them up
in a rude way of life among his cattle. That they were the sons of Mars, was
believed, as on plain proof, either because they were born in the grove of Mars,
or because they were nursed by a wolf, which is under the protection of Mars.
The names of the boys were Remus and Romulus. As they grew up among the
shepherds, daily contests in strength increased their vigour and agility. While
they were frequently engaged, with great activity, in preventing robbers from
seizing the cattle, it happened that Remus, having been taken by the robbers,
was brought before the king,<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> as if he had himself
been guilty of that which he was endeavouring to prevent in others, and had
been accustomed to make depredations on Numitor's flocks. He was consequently
given up to Numitor for punishment. But Numitor, <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
who was touched with <A NAME="p286"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|286</SPAN></A> compassion
for the stripling's youth, was led to suspect that he might be one of his
exposed grandchildren, and while the resemblance of his features to those of his
daughter, and his age corresponding with the time of the exposure, kept him in
suspense, Faustulus unexpectedly came in with Romulus, and the origin of the
youths being ascertained from him, a conspiracy was formed, the young men taking
up arms to revenge the death of their mother, and Numitor to recover the throne
of which he had been deprived.</p>
<p><b>III. </b>Amulius being killed, the throne was restored to Numitor, and the
city of Rome was founded by the two young men. A senate was next appointed,
consisting of a hundred old men who were called Fathers. Soon after, as the
neighbouring people disdained to intermarry with shepherds, the Sabine virgins
were seized by force; and the surrounding tribes being brought under their sway,
the sovereignty of Italy, and afterwards that of the world, was acquired. In
those times kings, instead of diadems, had spears, which the Greeks called
sceptres; for the ancients, from the earliest period, worshipped spears as gods,<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
and in memory of this superstition spears are still given to the statues of the
gods.</p>
<p>In the time of King Tarquin, a company of Phocaeans from Asia, sailing up the
Tiber, formed an alliance with the Romans, and proceeding from thence to the
inmost part of the gulf of Gaul,<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> built the city
of Marseilles amidst the Ligurians and the savage Gallic tribes, and performed
great exploits there, both in defending themselves against the fierce Gauls, and
in attacking, of themselves, those by whom they had previously been molested.</p>
<p>The Phocaeans, compelled by the smallness and infertility of their territory,
had applied themselves more to the sea than to the culture of the ground,
supporting themselves by fishing, merchandise, and above all by piracy, which in
those days was <A NAME="p287"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|287</SPAN></A> thought an
honourable occupation.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> Venturing accordingly to
visit the remotest shores of the ocean, they came into the gulf of Gaul and to
the mouth of the river Rhone; and, charmed with the pleasantness of the country,
and relating, on their return home, what they had seen, they tempted others to
go to the same parts. Of the fleet Simos and Protis were the captains, who
applied to the king of the Segobrigii, named Nannus, in whose territory they
were anxious to build a city, desiring his friendship. On that day, as it
happened, the king was engaged in preparing for the nuptials of his daughter
Gyptis, whom, after the custom of that people, he intended to give in marriage
to a son-in-law to be chosen at the feast. The suitors having been all invited
to the wedding, the Grecian strangers were also requested to join the festival.
The maiden was then introduced, and being desired by her father to give water
to him whom she chose for her husband, she overlooked all the rest, and turning
to the Greeks, held out water to Protis, who, from the king's guest becoming his
son-in-law, was presented by his father-in-law with the ground for building a
city. Marseilles was accordingly built near the mouth of the river Rhone, in a
retired bay, and as it were in a corner of the sea. The Ligurians, jealous of
the growing greatness of the city, harassed the Greeks with continual war; but
they, repelling their attacks, rose to such a degree of strength, that they
conquered their enemies and planted several colonies in the lands which they
captured.</p>
<p><b>IV. </b>From the people of Marseilles, therefore, the Gauls learned a more
civilized way of life, their former barbarity being laid aside or softened; and
by them they were taught to cultivate their lands and to enclose their towns
with walls. Then too, they grew accustomed to live according to laws, and not by
violence; then they learned to prune the vine and plant the olive; and such a
radiance was shed over both men and things, that it was not Greece which seemed
to have immigrated into Gaul, but Gaul that seemed to have been transplanted
into Greece.</p>
<p>After Nannus, king of the Segobrigii, from whom the ground for building the
city had been received, was dead, and his son Comanus had succeeded to the
throne, a certain <A NAME="p288"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|288</SPAN></A> Ligurian told
him that &quot;Marseilles would one day be the ruin of the neighbouring people,
and that he ought to suppress it in its rise, lest, when it grew stronger, it
should overpower him.'' To this prediction he added the following fable: &quot;A
bitch once asked a shepherd, when she was big with young, for a place to bring
forth her puppies; having obtained it, she requested again that she might be
allowed to bring them up in the same place; and at last, when her young were
grown up, and she could depend upon their support, she claimed possession of the
place as her own. In like manner,&quot; he continued, &quot;the people of
Marseilles, who are now regarded as your tenants, will one day become masters of
your territory.&quot; Moved by these persuasions, the king formed a plan to
overthrow Marseilles; in pursuance of which, on the day appointed for the feast
of Flora, he sent into the city several stout and able men. who were admitted as
friends; an additional number he ordered to be conveyed concealed in wagons,
covered over with baskets and boughs of trees; while he himself lay hid among
the neighbouring hills, that after the gates had been opened in the night by the
men before mentioned, he might come up in time to execute the plot, and might
fall upon the city overcome with sleep and the fumes of wine. But a certain
woman, a relative of the king, who had an intrigue with a Greek youth, revealed
the plot to him, through compassion for his youth and beauty, during their
intercourse, and bade him escape from the danger. He however reported the matter
to the magistrates, and the treachery being thus made public, all the Ligurians
were seized, those concealed being dragged from among their baskets; and when
they were all put to death, a plot was formed to surprise the plotter, and seven
thousand of the enemy, with the king himself, were slain. Since that time the
Massilians, on festal days, have been accustomed to shut their gates, to keep
watch, to place sentinels on the walls, to examine strangers, to take all kinds
of precaution, and to guard the city as carefully in time of peace as if they
were at war. Thus what was wisely instituted, is still observed, not from the
necessity of circumstances, but from the habit of acting prudently.</p>
<p><b>V. </b>Subsequently they had great wars with the Ligurians and Gauls,
which increased the fame of their city, and rendered the valour of the Greeks,
by their manifold victories, <A NAME="p289"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|289</SPAN></A>
renowned among their neighbours. The forces of the Carthaginians,<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
too, in a war which rose between them about the capture of some fishing boats,
they often routed, and granted them peace under defeat; with the Spaniards they
made an alliance; with the Romans they faithfully observed the league concluded
almost at the foundation of the city, and effectively supported their allies, in
all their wars, with auxiliary troops. Such conduct both increased their
confidence in their own strength, and secured them peace from their enemies. But
after a time, when Marseilles was at the height of distinction, as well for the
fame of its exploits as for the abundance of its wealth and its reputation for
strength, the neighbouring people, on a sudden, conspired to destroy the very
name of Marseilles, as they would have united to put out a fire that threatened
them all. Catumandus, one of their petty princes, was unanimously chosen
general, who, when he was besieging the enemy's city with a vast army of select
troops, was frightened in his sleep by the vision of a stern-looking woman, who
told him that she was a goddess, and of his own accord made peace with the
Massilians. Having then asked permission to enter their city and pay adoration
to their gods, and having gone into the temple of Minerva, and observed in the
portico the statue of the goddess whom he had seen in his sleep, he suddenly
exclaimed &quot;that it was she who had frightened him in the night; that it was
she who had ordered him to raise the siege;&quot; then, congratulating the
Massilians that they were under the care, as he perceived, of the immortal gods,
and offering a neck-lace of gold to the goddess, he made a league with them for
ever.</p>
<p>After peace was thus obtained, and security established, some deputies from
Marseilles, as they were returning from Delphi, whither they had been sent to
carry presents to Apollo, heard that the city of Rome had been taken and burned
by the Gauls. This calamity, when the news of it was brought home to them, the
Massilians lamented with a public mourning, and contributed gold and silver,
both public and private, to make up the sum to be given to the Gauls, from whom
they knew that peace was bought. For this service an exemption from taxes was
decreed them, a place in <A NAME="p290"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|290</SPAN></A> the
theatre assigned them among the senators, and a league made with them upon equal
terms.</p>
<p>At the end of this book Trogus relates that his ancestors had their origin
from the Vocontii; that his grandfather, Trogus Pompeius, received the right of
citizenship from Cnaeus Pompey in the Sertorian war; that his uncle led a troop
of cavalry under the same Pompey in the war with Mithridates; and that his
father served under Caius Caesar, and had the charge of his correspondence, of
receiving embassies <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> and of his ring.<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A></p>

<p><b>I. </b>SPAIN, as it forms the boundary of Europe, will also form the
conclusion of the present work. This country the ancients first called Iberia,
from the river Iberus, and afterwards Hispania, from some person named Hispanus.
It lies between Africa and Gaul, and is bounded by the Ocean Strait <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
and the Pyrenees. It is less than either of these countries, but more fruitful
than either; for it is neither scorched, like Africa, by a burning sun, nor
disturbed, like Gaul,<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> by incessant winds, but,
being situate betwixt both, it is rendered, by moderate heat on the one hand,
and genial and seasonable showers on the other, fertile in all kinds of fruits
of the earth, <A NAME="p291"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|291</SPAN></A> so that it supplies
abundance of everything, not only for its own inhabitants, but for Italy and the
city of Rome. From hence, indeed, comes not only great plenty of corn, but of
wine, honey, and oil. Its iron is excellent, and its breed of horses swift. Not
only is the produce of the surface to be admired, but the abundant riches of the
metals hidden beneath it. There is great plenty, too, of flax and hemp, and
certainly no country is more productive of vermilion. The courses of the rivers
are not violent and rapid, so as to be hurtful, but gentle, watering the
vineyards and the plains; they are also well stocked with fish from the
estuaries of the sea, and most of them are rich in gold, which they carry down
with their waters.<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> It is joined to Gaul by one
unbroken ridge of the Pyrenees; on every other side it is surrounded by sea. The
shape of the country is almost square, except that it grows narrower towards the
Pyrenees, the shores contracting in that quarter. The length of the Pyrenees is
six hundred miles. The salubrity of the air is the same through the whole of
Spain, for its atmosphere is infected with no unwholesome mists from fens.
Besides, there are constant breezes from the sea on every side, by which, as
they penetrate the whole country, the exhalations from the earth are dispersed,
and the greatest health is secured to the inhabitants.</p>
<p><b>II. </b>The bodies of the inhabitants are well adapted to endure privation
and fatigue; their minds are inured to contempt of death. A strict and
parsimonious abstinence prevails among them all. They prefer war to peace; and,
if no foreign enemy offers himself, they seek one at home. Many have died under
torture, to conceal what has been entrusted to them; so much stronger is their
love of honour than of life. The patience of a slave, too, is greatly praised,
who, having avenged his <A NAME="p292"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|292</SPAN></A> master in
the war with the Carthaginians, exulted with smiles in the midst of tortures,
and defied, with serenity and cheerfulness, the utmost cruelty of his
tormentors. The activity of the people is extraordinary; their minds restless.
To many, their war-horses and arms are dearer than their blood. There is no
sumptuous preparation among them for festival days; nor was it till after the
second Punic war that they learned from the Romans to use warm baths.</p>
<p>During so long a course of years they have had no great general besides
Viriatus,<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> who maintained a struggle against the
Romans for ten years with various success; so much more similar are their
dispositions to those of wild beasts than of men; and this very leader they
followed, not as having been chosen by the judgment of the people, but as being
well qualified to take precautions against the enemy, and artful in avoiding
danger. His temperance and moderation were such, that though he often defeated
armies commanded by consuls, yet, after such achievements, he made no change in
the fashion of his dress or arms, or in his diet, but adhered to the same way of
life with which he commenced his military career; so that any one of the common
soldiers seemed better off than the general himself.</p>
<p><b>III. </b>In Lusitania, near the river Tagus, many authors have said that
the mares conceive from the effect of the wind; but such stories have had their
origin in the fecundity of the mares, and the vast number of herds of horses,
which are so numerous, and of such swiftness, in Gallaecia and Lusitania, that
they may be thought, not without reason, to have been the offspring of the wind.
As for the Gallaecians, they claim for themselves a Greek origin; for they say
that Teucer, after the end of the Trojan war, having incurred the hatred of his
father on account of the death of his brother Ajax, and not being admitted into
his kingdom, retired to Cyprus, where he built a city called Salamis, from the
name of his native land; that, some time after, on hearing a report of his
father's death, he returned again to his country, but, being hindered from
landing by Eurysaces the son of Ajax, he sailed to the coast of Spain, and took
possession of those parts where New Carthage now stands, and, passing from
thence to Gallaecia, and <A NAME="p293"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|293</SPAN></A> fixing
his abode there, gave name to the nation. A part of the Gallaecians are called
Amphilochi. The country produces abundance of brass and lead, as well as of
vermilion,<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> which has given name to a river near
the part in which it is found. It is also very rich in gold, so that they
sometimes turn up clods of gold <A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> with the plough.
In the territory of this people there is a sacred mountain, which it is thought
impious to open with any tool of iron, but whenever the earth is rent with
lightning, an occurrence common in these parts, it is allowable to pick up the
gold that may be laid open, as a gift from the deity of the place. The women
manage household affairs, and the culture of the ground; the men attend only to
arms, and the pursuit of spoil. Their iron is of an extraordinary quality, but
their water is more powerful than the iron itself; for the iron, by being
tempered in it, becomes keener; nor is any weapon held in esteem among them
which has not been dipped either in the Bilbilis or the Chalybs. <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
From the latter river those who dwell on its banks are called Chalybes, and are
said to surpass the rest of the people in the manufacture of steel.</p>
<p><b>IV. </b>The forests of the Tartesians, in which it is said that the Titans
<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> waged war against the gods, the Cunetes <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
inhabited, whose most ancient king Gargoris, was the first to collect honey.
This prince, having a grandson born to him, the offspring of an intrigue on the
part of his daughter, tried various means, through shame for her unchastity, to
have the child put to death; but he, being preserved by some good fortune,
through all calamities, came at last to the throne, from a compassionate feeling
for the many perils that he had undergone. First of all he ordered him to be
exposed, that he might be starved, and, when he sent some days after to look for
his body, he was found nursed by the milk of various wild beasts. When he was
brought home, he caused him to be <A NAME="p294"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|294</SPAN></A>
thrown down in a narrow road, along which herds of cattle used to pass; being so
cruel that he would rather have his grandchild trampled to pieces, than
despatched by an easy death. As he was unhurt also in this case, and required no
food, he threw him to hungry dogs, that had been exasperated by want of food for
several days, and afterwards to swine, but as he was not only uninjured, but
even fed with the teats of some of the swine, he ordered him at last to be cast
into the sea. On this occasion, as if, by the manifest interposition of some
deity, he had been carried, amidst the raging tide, and flux and reflux of the
waters, not on the billows but in a vessel, he was put on shore by the subsiding
ocean; and, not long after, a hind came up, and offered the child her teats. By
constantly following this nurse, the boy acquired extraordinary swiftness of
foot, and long ranged the mountains and woods among herds of deer, with
fleetness not inferior to theirs. At last, being caught in a snare, he was
presented to the king; and then, from the similitude of his features, and
certain marks which had been burnt on his body in his infancy, he was recognized
as his grandson. Afterwards, from admiration at his escapes from so many
mischances and perils, he was appointed by his grandfather to succeed him on the
throne. The name given him was Habis; and, as soon as he became king, he gave
such proofs of greatness, that he seemed not to have been delivered in vain,
through the power of the gods, from so many exposures to death. He united the
barbarous people by laws; he was the first that taught them to break oxen for
the plough, and to raise corn from tillage; and he obliged them, instead of food
procured from the wilds, to adopt a better diet, perhaps through dislike of what
he had eaten in his childhood. The adventures of this prince might seem
fabulous, were not the founders of Rome said to have been suckled by a wolf, and
Cyrus, king of the Persians, to have been brought up by a dog. By him the people
were interdicted from servile duties, and the commonalty were divided among
seven cities. After Habis was dead, the sovereignty was retained for many
generations by his successors.</p>
<p>In another part of Spain, which consists of islands,<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
the <A NAME="p295"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|295</SPAN></A> supreme power was in the hands
of Geryon. Here there is such abundance of food for cattle, that unless the
feeding of the animals were occasionally interrupted, they would burst. Hence
the herds of Geryon, which in those days were accounted the only species of
wealth, were so renowned, that they tempted Hercules out of Asia by the
greatness of such a prize. Geryon himself, too, they say, was not a man with
three bodies, as is told in fables, but that there were three brothers living
in such unanimity, that they seemed all actuated by one soul; and that they did
not attack Hercules of their own accord, but, seeing their herds driven off,
endeavoured to recover what they had lost by force of arms.</p>
<p><b>V. </b>After the rule of kings was at an end, the Carthaginians were the
first that made themselves masters of the country; for when the Gaditani,
according to directions which they received in a dream, had removed the sacred
things of Hercules from Tyre, whence also the Carthaginians had their origin,
into Spain, and had built a city there, the neighbouring people of the country,
being jealous of the rise of this new city, and in consequence attacking the
Gaditani in war, the Carthaginians sent them succour as being their kindred. The
expedition being successful, they both secured the Gaditani from injury, and
added the greatest part of the province to their own dominions. Subsequently,
too, the success of their first attempt encouraging them, they sent their
general Hamilcar, with a large army, to take possession of the whole country,
who, having performed great exploits, but pursuing his fortune too rashly, was
drawn into an ambush and killed. In his stead was sent his son-in-law Hasdrubal,
who was also killed by the slave of a certain Spaniard, to avenge the unjust
death of his master. Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar, succeeded him, a greater
general than either of them; for, surpassing the achievements of both, he
subdued the whole of Spain, and then, making war upon the Romans, he harassed
Italy for sixteen years with various calamities, during which the Romans,
sending the Scipios into Spain, first drove the Carthaginians out of the
province, and afterwards carried on terrible wars with the Spaniards themselves.
Nor would the Spaniards submit to the yoke, even after their country was <A NAME="p296"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|296</SPAN></A>
over-run, until Caesar Augustus, having subdued the rest of the world, turned
his victorious arms against them, and reduced this barbarous and savage people,
brought by the influence of laws to a more civilized way of life, into the form
of a province.</p>

<p><A NAME="#24"></A>24.&nbsp;* Thucyd. i. 13: &quot;The Phocaeans, who founded
Marseilles, conquered the Carthaginians in a sea-fight.&quot; See also Herod. i.
166.</p>
<p><A NAME="#25"></A>25.&nbsp;* <i>Legationum</i>----<i>curam.</i>] To receive
embassies, and introduce them to the emperor, was the duty, under the later
emperors, sometimes of the <i>magister officiorum, </i>or master of ceremonies,
sometimes of the <i>magister epistolarum, </i>or secretary, as the author of the
<i>Notitia utriusque Imperii </i>has observed. Among the Persians this duty
devolved upon a chiliarch or military officer, who was next in rank to the king,
as appears from Corn. Nep. Vit. Conon., and Aelian. V. H. i. 21. In Egypt
Josephus speaks of Nicanor having been appointed by Ptolemy to receive
ambassadors, Antiq. xii. 2.----<i>Berneccerus.</i></p>
<p><i><A NAME="#26"></A></i>26.&nbsp;<i>+ Annuli.</i>] The same office which Maecenas
and Agrippa held under Augustus, and Mucianus under Vespasian, as appears from
Dion. Cass. and his epitomiser. See Kirchmann de Annulis, c. 6.----<i>Berneccerus.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#27"></A>27.&nbsp;++ <i>Oceani freto</i>.] The <i>Fretum Gaditanum, </i>Strait
of Gibraltar.</p>
<p><A NAME="#28"></A>28.&nbsp;&sect; Not all Gaul, but only the coasts of it.---- <i>Wetzel.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#29"></A>29.&nbsp;* <i>In paludibus</i>.] Berneccerus, Vorstius,
Graevius, and Faber, are unanimous in preferring <i>in balucibus, </i>which is a
correction of Salmasius ad Solin. p. 277. <i>Hispani quod minutum est </i>(<i>aurum</i>),<i>
balucem vocant. </i>Plin. H. N. xxxiii. 21. But Wetzel retains the old reading <i>paludibus,
</i>and I cannot but think him right; for the preposition <i>in </i>seems to
require that word rather than the other. It may be doubted, indeed, whether <i>in
balucibus vehunt </i>can be regarded as Latin. For <i>in balucibus </i>substitute
<i>in minutis particulis: </i>would Justin, or any other Latin author, have said
<i>amnes aurum in minutis particulis vehunt? </i>I think not. <i>In minutas
particulas friatum, disruptum, discerptum </i>would be more likely forms of
expression.</p>
<p><A NAME="#30"></A>30.&nbsp;* See Flor. ii. 17; Vell. Pat. ii. 1, 90; Aurel.
Vict. 71; Did. Sic. xxxiii. fragm. 3, 11, 22.</p>
<p><A NAME="#31"></A>31.&nbsp;* <i>Minio </i>] Hence the name of the river <i>Minho.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#32"></A>32.&nbsp;+ <i>Glebas aureas.</i>] Pliny makes the same
statement, H. N. xxxiii. 21.</p>
<p><A NAME="#33"></A>33.&nbsp;++ Isaac Vossius in his notes to Catullus says
that the Chalybs is a river between the Ana and the Tagus, which is called by
Ptolemy and Martianus <font face="SPIonic">Kali/pouj</font> or <font face="SPIonic">Ka&lipoj</font>.
I think him right.----<i>Graevius.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#34"></A>34.&nbsp;&sect; Tradition places the Titans in Thessaly, not in
Spain.---- <i>Wetzel.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#35"></A>35.&nbsp;|| They dwelt about Cape Cuneus, now C. St.
Vincent, in Portugal. The word is a correction of Isaac Vossius's, for the old
reading <i>Curetes, </i>who were a people of Crete.</p>
<p><A NAME="#36"></A>36.&nbsp;* <i>Quae ex insulis constat</i>] Wetzel thinks
that Justin supposed Geryon to have lived in the Balearic isles. How then did
Hercules drive off his herds? The whole story of Geryon is in a great degree
fabulous, and Justin was wrong in imagining that any part of Spain consisted of
islands.</p>
