<p align="center"><b>Eutropius: Historiae Romanae Breviarium (Abridgment of
Roman History) -- Preface to the online edition.</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">The Breviarium is a very short history of Rome from its
foundation down to the death of Jovian.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was written
around 369AD, and dedicated to Valens.&nbsp; In the late empire, even emperors
were often uneducated men with little knowledge of the history of Rome.&nbsp;
Eutropius condensed this history into ten short books.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The Breviarium gives only two facts about its author.&nbsp; It
tells us that he was an imperial bureaucrat who held the post of <i>Magister
memoriae</i> (Secretary of State for General Petitions) under Valens, and had
accompanied Julian the Apostate on his Persian campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Eutropius used two sources, themselves abbreviations.&nbsp; He
used a lost epitome of Livy, together with a set of imperial lives.&nbsp; This
latter work is now lost, but several late epitomes have sections of text which
are verbally identical, indicating the existence of a common source.&nbsp; The
unknown source is known as the <i>History of the Emperors / Kaisergeschichte</i>
and its existence was first postulated by A. Enmann in 1883.</p>

<p align="left">The Breviarium proved popular and was quickly translated into
Greek.&nbsp; The first version was made around 379 by Paeanius, and is still
extant. Another was made by Capito of Lycia, probably early in the 6th century,
of which fragments survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The Breviarium became a standard handbook, both in the Latin
west and Byzantine east.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 800 AD, Paul the Deacon, a
well-educated Lombard at the court of Charlemagne made a revised and extended
version.&nbsp; He had given a copy of the Breviarum to his friend Adelperga,
Duchess of Benevento.&nbsp; She complained that it was too short, and hardly
mentioned Christianity at all.&nbsp; In response he compiled the Historia
Romana, which extended Eutropius to the collapse of Gothic power in Italy in
552.&nbsp; He added material from Orosius, Jerome and others, together with six
books of his own.&nbsp; Paul's work is extant in very many manuscripts, and was
plainly popular, but fortunately did not supercede Eutropius entirely.&nbsp;
Eutropius was well-known to Bede, for instance.</p>

<p align="left">Around 1000 AD, the Historia Romana was revised itself by
Landolfo Sagax, who added more books and brought the story down to the 9th
century.&nbsp; This is the Historia Miscella.&nbsp; Both derivative works use
Eutropius verbatim in large chunks, and so are of value for correcting his text.</p>

<p align="left">Some 80 manuscripts have survived, of which 6 are
important.&nbsp; The variants in the text divide them into two families A and
B.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Family A contains the codex Gotha Membr. I. 101 (9th
    century), from Murbach (G), and F, a lost manuscript from Fulda collated by
    F. Sylburg.&nbsp; F is like G, but better.&nbsp; Further manuscripts of this
    family also exist, although of questionable independent value.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Family B contains codex Vaticanus latinus 1981 (11th
    century), codex Leidensis BPL 141 (10th century), codex Saint-Omer 697 (11th
    century) and codex Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 129 (13th century), as
    well as a host of inferior manuscripts.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">There may also have been a superior Italian family of the
    text, now lost.&nbsp; Codex Bamberg Class. 31 (E.III.22) was written in
    Italy in the early 10th century. It contains such excellent texts of Florus
    and Festus as to suggest a very good original.&nbsp; Sadly only the
    dedication of Eutropius was copied into this volume, but this is the only
    manuscript to give us the author's title: <i>Eutropius v.c. magister
    memoriae.</i></li>
</ul>

<p align="left">In the 18th and 19th centuries Eutropius was used as a school
text, and some very literal translations with notes were made for the purpose,
and constantly reprinted.</p>

<p align="left">The online translation is that made by the Rev. John Selby
Watson for the Bohn's Classical Library, and reprinted throughout the later 19th
century.&nbsp; My copy was an 1886 reprint.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; made two changes
to the translation.&nbsp; Watson renders 'Sulla', the republican general, as
'Sylla', and uses both 'Hadrian' and 'Adrian' for the emperor.&nbsp; I have
normalised these as 'Sulla' and 'Hadrian'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">A modern translation with copious notes has been made by
H.W.Bird, from whom I have taken many of these details.&nbsp; The reader is
referred to it for all the historical details of the period covered by
Eutropius.&nbsp; In particular Bird's notes give the ancient sources available
for the history in each chapter of Eutropius, which makes it very useful.</p>

<p align="left">Watson's notes seem to be rather dull, but I have transcribed
them anyway.&nbsp; In a couple of places where Watson indicates a difficulty I
have added a note based on H.W. Bird's version.</p>
