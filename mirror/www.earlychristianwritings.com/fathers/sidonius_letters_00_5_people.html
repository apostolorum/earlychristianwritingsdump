Nominated Emperor of the East by Leo, in 467, after the death of Severus. On the occasion of his second consulship in 468 Sidonius addressed a panegyric to him (<I>Carm. </I>ii), which helped to secure for him the Prefecture of Rome. Anthemius was not a strong ruler, though Arvandus was brought to justice in his reign.

<P>
<B>*Constantius. </B>*I.i; *III.ii; *VII. xviii; *VIII. xvi; II. x,3; <A NAME="pclxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxv</SPAN></A>
IX. xvi. 1. Priest. Of a noble family in Lyons; reputed for eloquence, judgement, and love of letters. The publication of Sidonius' Letters was suggested by him, and the first Letter dedicates the book to him. The eighth book, collected at the request of Petronius, was to be issued under his auspices. Constantius wrote little himself, his principal work being a Life of St. Germain of Auxerre, composed at the request of Patiens. His reputation as a poet led Patiens to ask of him a metrical inscription for his great church at Lyons (II. x). The character of Constantius was a noble one, and his influence wide. When the capital of Auvergne was laid desolate by the Visigothic siege, Sidonius sent for him, and his arrival had the most salutary effect upon the desperate population (III. ii). He is supposed to have died at an advanced age about 488. Cf. <I>Hist. litt, de la France, </I>ii; Chaix, ii, p. 206.
</P>
<P>
<B>Crocus</B>. VII. vi. 9. Bishop. Considered by Sirmond to have occupied the see of Nîmes; but the only recorded Crocus lived in the seventh century. (Duchesne, <I>Fastes épiscopaux, </I>i, p. 313.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Dardanus.</B> V. ix. i. Prefect of Gaul, <I>temp. </I>Honorius, 409-10. After his prefecture he appears to have embraced Christianity. Letters were addressed to him by Jerome and Augustine. For an inscription relating to him, cf. note, 60. 4,
p. 237.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Desideratus</B>. *II. viii. Friend: perhaps an ancestor of St. Desideratus, Bishop of Clermont after St. Avitus. His poetical judgement was highly valued in Auvergne, and Severianus considered it an advantage to publish a treatise on rhetoric under his auspices. <I>(Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, p. 576.)
</P>
<P>
*<B>Domitius</B>. *II. ii. Friend. Perhaps born at Lyons, but teaching as a grammarian in the schools of Ameria. Mentioned in <I>Carm. </I>xxiv. 10-16 as a severe critic, and compared to the censorious person who had only laughed once in his life.
</P>
<P>
<B>*Domnicius.   </B>*IV. xx; V. xvii. 6.    Friend.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Domnulus</B>. *IV. xxv; IX. xiii. 4, xv. i. Friend; living at Arles. Served as Quaestor. Poet and philosopher, with an interest in theology, and a Churchman. One of the four poets whom Majorian invited during his sojourn in Gaul.
<A NAME="pclxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxvi</SPAN></A> Probably still living, as an  old man, in 483 or 484.    Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xiv; <I>Hist. litt, de la France, </I>ii, p. 507.
</P>
<P>
<B>*Donidius. </B>*II. ix; III. v; VI. v. Friend. <I>Vir spectabilis. </I>Living on his ancestral estate at Eborolacum (Ebreuil, near Gannat), in the valley of the Sioule, part of which he lost during the disturbances of 474.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Ecdicius</B>. *II. i; *III. iii; II. ii. 15; V. xvi. 1. Son of the emperor Avitus; brother of Papianilla and brother-in-law of Sidonius. Patrician. An athlete and patriot, who became the champion of his countrymen during the last resistance of Auvergne to Euric's aggression. Ecdicius continued the policy of his father Avitus in conciliating the barbaric princes, and his diplomacy confirmed the Burgundians in their support of the Gallo-Romans against Euric; but he was also a defender of the purity of the Latin language against encroaching barbarism. During the misery which followed Euric's invasion, Ecdicius rivalled Patiens in the generosity with which he relieved the starving. Some consider that he is the Isicius who succeeded Mamertus as Bishop of Vienne (Chaix, ii, p. 209). It is also thought that he is the Decius whom Jornandes describes as leaving his country in disgust after its surrender to the Goths <I>(Get. </I>xlv).
</P>
<P>
*<B>Elaphius</B>. *IV. xv. Friend. Resident in Rodez, where he built a baptistery. Perhaps subsequently a bishop. (Ruricius, <I>Ep. </I>II. vii; <I>Gallia Christiana, </I>iii, p. 593; Tillemont, <I>Mem. </I>xvi, p. 260.)
</P>
<P>
*<B>Eleutherius</B>. *VI. xi. Bishop. (Tillemont, <I>Mem. </I>xvi, p. 232.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Eminentius</B>.    IV. xvii. 1.   Friend of Arbogast.
</P>
<P>
<B>Epiphanius.</B> V. xvii. 10. <I>Scriba </I>or Secretary, either of Filimatius or Sidonius.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Eripbius</B>. *V. xvii. Friend; of Lyons. Son-in-law of Filimatius.
</P>
<P>
<B>Eucherius</B>. IV. iii. 7. St. Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons, previously monk at Lerins, D. 449. Author of various treatises and homilies. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xvi, 1. 115; <I>Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, p. 275; Duchesne, <I>Fastes épiscopaux, </I>ii, p. 163.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Eucherius</B>. *III. via; VII. ix. 18. Friend. <I>Vir illustris.</I> <A NAME="pclxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxvii</SPAN></A>
A man of integrity, for whom the decaying Roman empire found no important post. Sirmond conjectures him to be the same Eucherius who, under Count Victorius, when Euric had seized Auvergne, was falsely accused, and put to death. (Gregory of Tours, <I>Hist. Franc. </I>II. xx; Tillemont, <I>Mem. </I>xvi,
p. 303.)
</P>
<P>
*<B>Euphronius</B>. *VII. viii; *IX. ii; IV. xxv. 2. Bishop of Autun. His visit to Châlon with Patiens, described in IV. xxv, must have taken place about 470, when he was advanced in years. Of his writings, there remains only a letter written jointly with Lupus of Troyes to the Bishop of Angers on questions of ecclesiastical discipline. He died at a great age about 476. <I>(Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, p. 465; Chaix, ii, p. 74; Duchesne, <I>Fastes épiscopaux, </I>ii, p. 117.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Euric</B> (Eoricus, Evarix). VII. vi. 4; VIII. iii, ix. 5. Cf. I. vii. 5; II. i. 3; IV. viii. 1; VIII. ix. 1. King of the Visigoths. Murderer and successor of his brother Theodoric II. A bigoted Arian, conqueror, and energetic ruler, who extended his territory from Septimania, until by the conquest of Auvergne and Berry, and the cession by Odovakar of the last territory preserved to Rome in Provence, it embraced the whole of southern France outside the Burgundian dominions. Euric probably died in 484-5 in the nineteenth year of his reign (Jornandes, <I>Getica, </I>c. lvii), though Isidore of Seville and Gregory of Tours give different dates. Cf. Chaix, ii, p. 330.
</P>
<P>
<B>Eusebius</B>. IV. i. 3. Teacher of philosophy at Lyons, where he taught Sidonius and many of his friends.
</P>

Faustmus. IV. iv. I; vi. 1. Friend of Sidonius from his youth. Entered the Church, and perhaps became the successor of Hermentarius at Velay. <I>(Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii. p. 551 ; cf. Chaix, ii, pp. 116, 118.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Faustus.</B> Born in Britain. Abbot of Lerins (433-4) for twenty-seven years, where he established a school. Subsequently Bishop of Riez (462).

Preached at the dedication of Patiens' new church at Lyons (IX. iii). Published a famous letter maintaining the materiality of the soul (IV. iii; Guizot, <I>Hist. de la Civ. en France, </I>v. 165 f.), wrote against the Arians, for which he was exiled by Euric to the district of Limoges, where he enjoyed the intercourse of Ruricius; liberated in 484, and died at an advanced age <I>(c. </I>490). His writings, which give evidence of a modified Pelagianism, were regarded as heretical after his death, but were not condemned in his lifetime. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xvi. See <I>Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii. 587; <I>Mon. Germ. Historica, </I>viii (Auctorum Antiquiss. pp. liv ff.); Chaix, i, pp. 248-9; ii, p. 294; Duchesne, <I>Fastes épiscopaux, </I>i, p. 284.

Though a Catholic, he was selected by Euric as minister, in which capacity he doubtless made easier the lot of many of his co-religionists.

Summoned to the see of Troyes in 426 or 427. Opponent of Pelagianism.

<P>
<B>Riochatus</B>. IX. ix. A priest (or bishop) and monk <I>(antistes ac monachus), </I>who visited Clermont, bearing with him works by Faustus of Riez.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Riothamus</B>. *III. ix. Commander of the Bretons engaged to join the Empire in resisting the advance of the Visigoths. He engaged Euric before Roman support could reach him and was defeated by that king at Bourg-de-Déols on the Indre, whereupon he took refuge with the Burgundians. Cf. Introduction, p. xxxvi.
</P>
<P>
<B>Roscia. </B>V. xvi. 5. Daughter of Sidonius and Papianilla. Cf. Introduction, p. xiv.

*<B>Ruricius</B>. *IV. xvi; *V. xv; *VIII. x. Friend. Member of a patrician family connected with the Gens Anicia. Married, before 470, Iberia, daughter of the Arvernian Ommatius, Sidonius writing their epithalamium <I>(Carm. </I>xi). After some years, he renounced the world for a life of piety. In 484 he became Bishop of Limoges. Author of two books of Letters, in which an imitation of Sidonius is sometimes apparent. These mostly date from the time previous to his episcopate, and though exemplary in their piety, and showing an admirable character, contain little of interest for the historian. Of them Bk. I. ix, xvi are addressed to Sidonius. (<I>Hist. litt. de la France, </I>iii, pp. 49-56.) See also Krusch, <I>Mon. Germ. Historica, </I>viii (Auctorum Antiquissimorum, pp. lxiiff.).

</P>
<P>
*<B>Salonius</B>. * VII. xv. Friend; living at Vienne. Some have considered him to be the son of St. Eucherius of the same name, who was a bishop when Sidonius was quite young, but this view is not universally accepted. <I>(Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, p. 433; Tillemont, <I>Mémoires, </I>xvi, p. 207; Sirmond, note to VII. xv.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
*<B>Secundus</B>. *II. xii. Nephew of Sidonius, or grandson of one of his uncles (Mommsen, <I>Praefatio, </I>p. xlvii).
</P>
<P>
<B>Seronatus</B>. II. i. i; V. xiii. i, 4; VII. vii. 2. Perhaps Governor of Aquitanica Prima (cf. Introduction, p. xxxviii). He was guilty of more open treason and even worse oppression than his predecessor. The people of Auvergne brought him to justice, and he received the penalty of death. Cf. Tillemont, <I>Hist, des Empereurs, </I>vi, p. 352; Chaix, i, p. 377.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Serranus</B>. *II. xiii. Friend; living at Narbonne. Adherent of the Emperor Petronius Maximus. Friend of Marcellinus.

</P>
<P>
<B>Severinus.</B> I. xi. 10, 16. Consul of the year 461. Guest at the banquet of Majorian.
</P>
<P>
<B>Sigismer.</B> IV. xx. A young Frankish (?) prince. Cf. Introduction, p. xciii.
</P>
<P>
<B>Simplicius.</B>    VII. vi. 9.    A bishop.
</P>
<P>
<B>Simplicius.</B> VII. viii. 2, 3; ix. 16, 25. Son of Eulogius and son-in-law of Palladius, both bishops of Bourges. Nominated by Sidonius to the same see. (Chaix, ii, p. 20.)

</P>
<P>
*<B>Syagrius</B>, *V. v; *VIII. viii. Great-grandson of the preceding. Man of letters. At one period living much at the Burgundian court; at another on his estate of Taionnacus near Autun. It seems best to follow the Benedictine <I>Histoire littéraire de la France, </I>ii, p. 651, in regarding this personage as distinct from Syagrius, son of Aegidius of Soissons, defeated by Clovis in 486. Sirmond and others, however, regard V. v. at least, if not both letters, as written to that Syagrius. The objection to this view is that the ruler of Soissons would hardly have been able to live among Burgundians or in a country-house so far away from his proper sphere of interest.
</P>
<P>
<B>Symmachus Quintus Aurelius</B>. I. i. i; II. x. 5; cf. VIII. x. i. Flourished in the second half of the fourth century. Consul 391. Famous as an orator, though most of his speeches are lost. His <I>Letters </I>survive in ten books, and are written in a style which compared with that of Sidonius is simple and
<A NAME="pclxxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxxxi</SPAN></A> direct. The best known is that relating to the proposed restoration of the altar of Victory in the Senate. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>ix. 304.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Tetradius</B>. *III. x. Friend. A jurisconsult of Arles. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xxiv. 80-3; <I>Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, pp. 577-8.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Thaumastus</B>. *I. vii; I. vii. 4; V. vi. i. Friend. Brother of Apollinaris. Associated with Tonantius Ferreolus in the impeachment of Arvandus. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xxiv. 85.

<P>

Succeeded in 453 after the assassination of his brother Thorismond. Supported the election of Avitus as emperor, having been acquainted with him in former years, and on his deposition and death opposed Majorian, by whom he was defeated before Arles. Afterwards once more reconciled to the Empire, but assassinated by his brother Euric in 466. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>vii. 262, &amp;c.; and see Introduction, p. xvi.
</P>
<P>
<B>Theodorus.</B> III. x. i. <I>Vir clarissimus. </I>Introduced by Sidonius to the jurisconsult Tetradius.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Theoplastus</B>. *VI.v. Bishop of Geneva (?). (Duchesne, <I>Fastes épiscopaiix, </I>i, p. 227.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Thorismond</B> (Thorismodus). VII. xii. 3. King of the Visigoths. Son of Theodoric I, who died in the great battle of Maurica, and brother of Theodoric II, by whom he was assassinated in 453. Besieged Arles soon after the defeat of Attila, but was induced to withdraw through the practical diplomacy of Tonantius Ferreolus <I>(q. v</I>.).
</P>
<P>
*<B>Tonantius Ferreolus</B>. *VII. xii. i; I. vii. 4; II. ix. i. Grandson of the Consul Afranius Syagrius, and through his mother, Papianilla, connected with the Aviti. An important Gallo-Roman noble, son of a Prefect of the Gauls, himself three times Prefect, and Patrician. With Avitus, he was instrumental in arranging the co-operation of the Visigoths with the Romans, which resulted in the defeat of Attila at Maurica by Aëtius. He was gifted with diplomatic powers which enabled him to save the town of Arles when besieged by the new Visigothic king Thorismond, at the trifling cost of a dinner (VII. xii), but his qualities as a strong and just
<A NAME="pclxxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxxxii</SPAN></A> administrator led to his selection, after his official career, as the principal accuser of Arvandus (I. vii). His tastes were cultivated; cf. the description which Sidonius gives of his country-house Prusianum (II. ix). Born about 420, he died about 485, and was thus a lifelong contemporary of his friend Sidonius. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xxiv, 1. 36; <I>Hist. Hit. de la France, </I>iii, p. 540.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Tonantius</B>. *IX. xiii; IX. xv. Son of Tonantius Ferreolus. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xxiv. 34.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Trygetius</B>. *VIII. xii. According to Sirmond, the same Trygetius sent on an embassy to Attila with St. Leo and Avienus. At the time of Sidonius' visit to his friends at Bordeaux, Trygetius was living at his house at Bazas. Cf. Chaix, ii, pp. 225-6.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Turnus</B>.    *IV. xxiv.   Friend.   Son of Turpio.
</P>
<P>
<B>Turpio</B>. IV. xxiv. Friend; of tribunician rank. On his death-bed requested Sidonius to help his family in the matter of a debt to Maximus. See Turnus.
</P>
<P>
<B>Valerianus</B>, Priscus. V. x. 2. Prefect of Gaul, and relative of the Emperor Avitus. Father-in-law of Pragmatius. Consulted by Sidonius on the merits of his Panegyric of Avitus. Cf. <I>Carm. </I>viii. See also <I>Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, p. 360; Chaix, ii, p. 183.
</P>
<P>
*<B>Vectius</B> (Vettius). *IV. xiii; IV. ix. i. Friend. A noble living in the world, but practising austerities in secret. His home was near Chanteile in the Bourbonnais. (Chaix, ii, p. 239.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Victorius.</B> VII. xvii. i. Cf. IV. x. 2. Appointed Count of Auvergne by Euric, after he obtained possession of that country in 475. Probably the <I>patronus </I>of IV. x. 2. Gregory of Tours, who describes him as duke, gives him a much worse character than Sidonius <I>(Hist. Franc. </I>II. xx. and <I>De gloria Confessorum, </I>c. xxxiii).
</P>
<P>
<B>Victorius.</B> V. xxi. Uncle of Sacerdos and Justin. Sirmond thinks it probable that the person to whom this letter is addressed is Victorius of Aquitaine, who in 457 under the Consulate of Constantine and Rufus composed the Paschal Cycle, and had some repute as a poet (cf. V. x). His
<A NAME="pclxxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxxxiii</SPAN></A> home was among the hills of the Gabalitani, now the district of La Lozère. <I>(Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, pp. 419, 424.) The poet and the author of the Cycle are distinguished.
</P>
<P>
<B>*Vincentius.</B>    *I. vii.    Friend.
</P>
<P>
<B>Vindicius. </B>V. i. 2; VII. iv. i. Friend. A deacon of Auvergne, who assisted Sidonius in his literary work.
</P>
<P>
<B>*Volusianus. </B>*VII. xvii; IV. xviii. 2. Intimate friend. At Sidonius' request he assisted with advice and support Auxanius <I>(q. v</I>.), successor of St. Abraham, as abbot of the monastery of St. Cirgnes, near Clermont. On the death of Perpetuus he became bishop of Tours. (Chaix, ii, pp. 222, 224.)
