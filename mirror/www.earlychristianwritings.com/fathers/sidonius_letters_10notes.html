</P>
<P>
1. 1. Both Petrarch (Letters: preface) and Politian (Letters, I. i.) imagined that in this passage Sidonius was depreciating Cicero; but modern commentators take the more natural view that the greatest of Roman letter-writers is placed among authors of supreme excellence, and regarded as beyond imitation. Cf. Sirmond, Notes, p. 7; Germain, i, p. 81; Baret, pp. 76, 105.
</P>
<P>
The Symmachus mentioned in the text is Q. Aurelius Symmachus, who flourished at the close of the fourth century and has left ten books of Letters. An orator as well as a writer and a prominent Senator, and one of the last distinguished defenders of paganism, he is remembered for his effort to secure the restoration of the altar of Victory to the Senate House.
</P>
<P>
Julius Titianus, an orator, lived in the time of Maximin I, who chose him as tutor in rhetoric for his son; during the latter part of his life he presided over the Schools of Lyons and Besancon. He was the author of geographical agricultural works, and of a book of fables. The 'Letters of Famous Women' were placed in the mouths of heroines, after the manner of the Heroides of Ovid. Cf. <I>Histoire litteraire de la France, </I>i, pp. 401-4.
</P>
<P>
2. M. Cornelius Fronto, orator, the distinguished master of Marcus Aurelius, who bestowed the consulship on him in 161.
<A NAME="p216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
2. 1. The poems of Sidonius were probably published in 468, several years before this first book of the Letters. This date is probable because the Panegyric of Anthemius begins the book, out of its chronological order, a fact which points to publication during the reign of that emperor.
</P>
<P>
3. 1. A corrupt passage. The text reads: <I>Cervix non </I>[sedet nodis] <I>sed nervis.</I>
</P>
<P>
2. Reading: <I>genis ut adhuc vesticipibus. </I>Another reading is: <I>genas ad usque forcipibus, </I>which would recall the use of the tweezers so frequently found in Teutonic cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
3. This allusion to Theodoric's Arian clergy, and his mechanical outward conformity, is probably intended to reconcile the orthodox Gallo-Romans to a possible extension of the Visigothic king's influence. See Introduction, p. xvi.
</P>
<P>
4. 1. The doorway of the hall was screened by curtains outside which was a barrier; the guards were posted between the two. Sirmond quotes Corippus (III. ch. vi) on the audience hall of Justin, where a similar arrangement prevailed. Cf. also Cassiodorus <I>(Variae, </I>XL vii).
</P>
<P>
2. Sidonius uses the word <I>toreuma </I>here, as in II. xiii and IX. xiii, for <I>toral </I>or <I>forale, </I>the covering of a couch.   In
this he follows Prudentius and Salvian (Sirmond, Notes, p. 9).
</P>
<P>
5. 1<I>. Tabula. </I>The use of this word implies that the game was played with a board, while the mention of <I>calculi </I>a few lines below shows that 'men' were probably used in addition to the dice. Various suggestions as to the game here intended have been made; the game of <I>Duodecim scripta, </I>in which both 'men' and dice were used, seems probable. Cf. Marquardt, <I>Privatleben, </I>p. 857.
</P>
<P>
2. The words are: <I>Sine motu evaditur, sine colludio evadit. </I>The verb may refer merely to the breaking up of the party; but the allusion may be, as Hodgkin thought, to the process of getting the men out of one's opponent's 'table'.
</P>
<P>
6. 1. <I>Organa hydraulica. </I>Cf. Vitruvius, ix. 9 and x. 1,13. Hydraulic organs are said to have been invented by Ctesibius of Alexandria in the time of Ptolemy Euergetes (247-222 B.C.). Hero of Alexandria (<I>Pneumatica, </I>ch. lxvi) describes
<A NAME="p217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A> one; another description is given by Vitruvius. Athenaeus, Tertullian, and Claudian all allude to such organs, which were evidently very popular in the Roman empire from the third century. An example is represented in a terra-cotta found at Carthage (Daremberg and Saglio, <I>Dictionnaire des antiquites grecques et romaines, </I>iii, p. 312, and fig. 3919).
</P>
<P>
7. 1. The Calpurnian law permanently excluded from the Senate, and punished by a fine, those convicted of political intrigue. The Julian law excluded for five years only. The emperors, when they nominated to magistracies, attached penalties to this offence. Sidonius speaks retrospectively, without particular regard for the circumstances of his own day.
</P>
<P>
2. For the Palatine Service see Cassiodorus <I>(Variae, </I>vi. 6 ff.). It is sometimes described as <I>militia Palatina, </I>the former word bearing no necessary relation to military service. Cf. VI. i below.
</P>
<P>
3. Gaudentius, as tribune of the praetorium, had occupied a lower rank than the Vicarii, who represented the prefect in the several dioceses. Filimatius is urged to accept membership of the Prefect's Council, because it conferred important privileges, and a status above those who had only served Vicarii in the same manner. For the advisory bodies of high officials in the provinces, see Reid in C. M. H. i, p. 48.
</P>
<P>
4. The text is: <I>Scamnis tamen amicalibus deputabuntur. </I>The general sense appears to be that Gaudentius was of a generous nature and caused the officials of his court to assign good places to his detractors. P'or the position of the Vicarius, cf. Reid in C. M. H. i, p. 32.
</P>
<P>
8. 1. There is here a lacuna in the text, after which there appears to be a change of subject.
</P>
<P>
9. 1. A private person could only avail himself of the <I>cursus publicus </I>or imperial post service, by land or water, if he had received an imperial summons and was furnished with an imperial letter. (Cf. Theodoret, ii, 11; Symmachus, <I>Ep. </I>ii, 63.) Cassiodorus mentions the state galleys maintained on the Po in Theodoric's time <I>(Variae, </I>II. xxxi). Cf. also Marquardt, <I>Romische Staatsverwaltung, </I>i, pp. 558 ff.
<A NAME="p218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
10. 1. For the story of Phaethon's sisters, who, upon his death, mourned so bitterly that they were changed into poplars, and their tears into amber-coloured gum, see Ovid, <I>Metamorphoses, </I>ii.
</P>
<P>
2. Many of the epithets applied by Sidonius to these rivers are those used by Virgil and Claudian.
</P>
<P>
3. Virgil, Eclogue ix, 28:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<I>Mantua vae miserae nimium vicina Cremonae.</I>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
4. For the frogs, and the scarcity of drinking-water in Ravenna, cf. Martial, <I>Epigrams, </I>iii, 5 r, 56. Ravenna proper, Classis its port, and the suburb which grew up along the road connecting the two, really formed a single city.
</P>
<P>
11. 1. Ariminum was the first city to pass under Caesar's power when he had crossed the Rubicon, after his 'rebellion' against the Senate. Fanum received its name from the temple to Fortune erected there in memory of the victory of 207 B. c., when Hasdrubal was slain on the Metaurus.
</P>
<P>
2. Cf. Horace, <I>Sat. </I>i. 5. The Atabulus, or Sirocco, derived its name from the Greek words
a!th<I> </I>and ba&amp;llw;<I> </I>as we might say, 'death-dealing.'
</P>
<P>
12. 1. These epithets are again employed by earlier authors. Cf. note 10. 2 above.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Apostolorum liminibiis affusus. </I>The basilica of St. Peter was not included in the <I>pomoerium </I>until the time of Leo IV, the builder of the 'Leonine City'; that of St. Paul has always been without the walls. To reach either, Sidonius would have to make a detour, as the Flaminian Way entered Rome at the north, where the Piazza del Popolo now stands at the top of the Corso.
</P>
<P>
3. For Ricimer, see pp. xix ff. The marriage with Anthemius' daughter, Alypia, was a purely political union; see Introduction, pp. xxv, xxxiii.
</P>
<P>
4. Shouts of 'Thalassio' were raised at Roman weddings when the bride was conducted to the bridegroom's house. The traditional explanation is that the word signifies the name of a Roman senator of the time of Romulus. During the rape of the Sabine women, a maid of exceptional beauty was carried off for him, the bearer shouting 'for Thalassius' in order to protect himself from interference.
<A NAME="p219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A>&nbsp; (Cf. Marquardt, <I>Privatleben, </I>p. 54.) Fescennine verses, of an outspoken character, were sung at marriage feasts. The present passage seems to show that the Christian wedding still admitted many pagan features in the year 467, though Sidonius may be writing 'classically' with an eye rather to literary effect than to reality. The early Christians disapproved of the usage of the garland at weddings (cf. Tertullian, <I>De Corona, </I>xiii); but the custom was afterwards restored. For the <I>corona </I>in Christian times, see J. Schrijnen, <I>La Couronne nuptiale dans l'antiquite chretienne, </I>in <I>Melanges d'archeologie et d'histoire, </I>xxxi, p. 309.
</P>
<P>
13. 1. <I>Militiae Palatinae.    </I>Cf. note 7. 2 above.
</P>
<P>
14. 1. <I>In qua unica totius orbis emitate soli barbari et servi peregrinantur. </I>The allusion is to the extension of Roman citizenship by Caracalla to the whole empire, after which all but aliens and slaves were 'at home' within the walls. With the preceding eulogy of the city, cf. Cassiodorus, <I>Var. </I>i. 49; II. i; x. 7.
</P>
<P>
15. 1. <I>Conatuum tuorum socius adjutor praevius particeps ero. </I>Cf. Pliny, <I>Ep. </I>vi. 9.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Casus Arvandi.    </I>See Introduction, p. xxx.
</P>
<P>
16. 1. <I>Comite sacrarum largitionum. </I>The functions of the 'Count of the Sacred (Imperial) Largesses' expanded with the lapse of time, and included multifarious duties. But he was essentially the great imperial Minister of Finance. Cf. Cassiodorus, <I>Var. </I>vi. 7, &amp;c.; Symmachus, <I>Ep. </I>x. 33. See also Mommsen, <I>Libri Theodosiani XVI, </I>vol. i, p. 45; Hodgkin, <I>Italy and her Invaders, </I>i, pp. 216, 217, and <I>Letters of Cassiodorus, </I>p. 88; Reid in C.M.H. i, pp. 43, 47.
</P>
<P>
2. The <I>gesta decretalia </I>embodied the provincial decree and formed the credentials of the envoys, without which they could not be heard. (Codex Theod. <I>De legatis.</I>) Cf. <I>Pagina decretalis, </I>in VII. ix. 6.
</P>
<P>
3. For Tonantius Ferreolus, Petronius, and Thaumastus, see List of Correspondents. L. Afranius Syagrius was consul in the reign of Gratian.
</P>
<P>
18. 1. The manuscripts have the word <I>decemviris. </I>An accused senator was usually judged by the Prefect of the City,
<A NAME="p220"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|220</SPAN></A>
assisted by a committee of five senators chosen by lot. If <I>decemviris </I>is not a mistake for <I>quinqueviris, </I>we must suppose that the usage admitted of exceptions. Cf. Cod. Theod. xiii: <I>De accusationibus, </I>and Cassiodorus, <I>Var. </I>iv. 22, 23.
</P>
<P>
19. 1. <I>Respondere legati, quanquam valde nequiter, constaret, quod ipse dictasset. </I>A difficult passage. Mohr (<I>Praefafio, </I>p. xiii) takes <I>constaret as = iterum affirmaret, </I>i.e. 'let him repeat the admission that he himself dictated the letter'.
</P>
<P>
20. 1. The island in the Tiber where a temple of Aesculapius stood. The great temple of Aesculapius was at Epidaurus, and the serpent was his attribute as Healer.
</P>
<P>
2. The law of Tiberius only granted ten days' reprieve; Theodosius extended the term to thirty.
</P>
<P>
21. 1. The Rhone mists are still proverbial in the Lyons of modern times.
</P>
<P>
2. The clergy were forbidden to trade or to lend money at unfair usury. 'Readers', however, traded (cf.VI. viii), and clergy occasionally had money out at interest, a practice which Sidonius himself seems to sanction, provided the rate was fair (cf. IV. xxiv). The Syrians, described by Jerome as <I>avarissimi mortalium, </I>were the ubiquitous traders of the early Christian centuries in the West.
</P>
<P>
23. 1. Sidonius had come to Rome as a member of a mission from Auvergne. Cf. Introduction, p. xxvii.
</P>
<P>
24. 1. The <I>opusculum </I>is the Panegyric of Anthemius, which is counted as <I>Carmen </I>ii in the poems of Sidonius.
</P>
<P>
25. 1. Thraso is the bombastic soldier in the <I>Eunuchus </I>of Terence; Pyrgopolinices, the <I>Miles gloriosus </I>of Plautus.
</P>
<P>
2. For the functions of the <I>Praefectus annonae </I>in these late centuries, cf. Cassiodorus, <I>Var. </I>IV. lxviii; Symmachus, <I>Ep. </I>X. xlviii. As in Tacitus' day, the theatre was always the principal scene of discontent if the corn supplies ran short. The Vandal command of the Mediterranean was the reason for Sidonius' anxiety.
</P>
<P>
26. 1. The quotation is from Horace, <I>Sat. </I>II. i. 82 ff., and the allusion to the law of the Twelve Tables against libel. 27.1. The events here described occurred during Majorian's
<A NAME="p221"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|221</SPAN></A>
visit to Arles in 461, after his pacification of Auvergne.   See Introduction, p. xxiii, and cf. Chaix, i, pp. 132 ff.
</P>
<P>
2. The especial reference is to the setting up of Nero's verses in gold letters on the Capitol, as related by Suetonius.
</P>
<P>
28. 1. <I>Qui genus? unde domo?    </I>Virgil, <I>Aeneid, </I>viii. 114.
</P>
<P>
2. Chremes was the avaricious father of comedy.
</P>
<P>
3. <I>Coniuratio Marcelliana. </I>The word in its existing form can hardly be correct (Mohr, <I>Praefatio, </I>p. xv) if Marcellinus was the hero of the rebellion. See Introduction, p. xx.
</P>
<P>
29. 1. <I>Pharsalia, </I>v. 322.
</P>
<P>
30. 1 . The couch was the <I>stibadium, </I>often called <I>sigma, </I>from its resemblance to the C-shaped form of that Greek letter: we might call it a 'horse-shoe' couch. The places of honour were at the end of the right and left 'horns'; in the present case the emperor was at the right, the consul at the left extremity.
</P>
<P>
31. 1. Sidonius had probably been given the rank of count by Majorian. Constantine used this older title as an honorific designation for various officers, and four of the highest members of the imperial service bore it. In course of time it was divorced from the Court, and those whom it designated were divided into grades, the honour in some cases (as perhaps in that of Sidonius) being purely honorary. (Reid, in C. M. H.
i, pp. 46, 47.)
</P>
<P>
34. 1. The name <I>Seronatus </I>is the opposite of <I>Citonatus, </I>'quick born', and intended to signify an easy delivery. Sidonius gives it a meaning of his own, and then cites it as an example of antiphrasis (as Euxine for an inhospitable sea, Parcaefor the implacable Fates, &amp;c.).
</P>
<P>
35. 1. <I>Nec dat pretia contemnens, nec accipit instrumenta desperans. </I>Gregory of Tours <I>(Hist. Franc. </I>IV. xii) quotes this phrase, applying it to the avaricious bishop Cautinus. The sense in that place seems to preclude the idea that the bishop neglected to furnish himself with deeds, because in the sequel he insists upon having them. The point here seems to be that Seronatus mistrusted deeds, as possible sources of evidence against him. Cf. Chaix, i, p. 377.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Leges Theudosianas calcans Theudoricianasque proponens. </I>Paronomasia is used to give effect to the charge that
<A NAME="p222"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|222</SPAN></A>
Seronatus was barbarophile for treasonable purposes of his own. His contemporary, Euric, the successor of Theodoric II, issued a new code about 476, improving upon those of his predecessors, Theodoric I and II. All incorporated much from the Roman (Theodosian) Code, for which see Mommsen, as tinder note 16. I. Seronatus, who, though nominally a Roman official, was openly acting in the Gothic interest, is depicted as giving barbaric law an unfair preference. See Introduction.
</P>
<P>
3. i. e. by the tonsure: they would enter the Church.
</P>
<P>
36. 1. <I>Samia mihi mater fuit. </I>Terence, <I>Eunuchus, </I>I. ii. 27 (107).
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Avitaci sumus. </I>The villa of Avitacum, named from Avitus, is the estate which Sidonius received with his wife Papianilla. Fauchet considered that it was situated by the lake of Sorlieu, then called Abitac, and now, perhaps, Obier (<I>Antiquites francaises, </I>i, p. 53). But the position is uncertain; another opinion favours the lake of Aydat, in Puy-de-Dome. In any case, Avitacum was not far from Clermont. The description is modelled on Pliny's pictures of his country-houses (<I>Ep. </I>II. xvii; V. vi). Cf. Chaix, i, pp. 148 ff.
</P>
<P>
37. 1. <I>Balneum. </I>For the arrangement of the Roman bath, see Daremberg and Saglio, <I>Dict. des antiquites grecques et romaines, </I>s. v. <I>Balnea, </I>and Marquardt, <I>Privatleben, </I>pp. 279 ff. Cf. also the two letters of Pliny mentioned in the preceding note. The principal rooms were the <I>tepidarium, </I>or hot-air chamber; <I>caldarium, </I>or warm bath, <I>frigidarium, </I>or cold bath. The <I>destrictarium </I>or <I>unctorium, </I>near the <I>tepidarium, </I>was for rubbing-down and anointing; the <I>apodyterium
</I>for undressing. The <I>piscina, cisterna, </I>or <I>baptisterium, </I>was in the <I>frigidarium. </I>The <I>exedra </I>was a conversation-room. The verses on the walls of Sidonius' baths, 'which people might read once and would not wish to read again,' are probably those preserved to us in <I>Carm. </I>xviii and xix.
</P>
<P>
38. 1. Philistio was a mimeograph of the Augustan age.
</P>
<P>
41.  1.   Cf. II. ix; III. iii;   IV. iv; V. xvii.
</P>
<P>
42. 1. <I>Agonem Drepitanum Troianae superstitionis. </I>The Arvernians claimed a Trojan descent (cf. VII. vii and p. 243,
<A NAME="p223"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|223</SPAN></A>
note 110. 2).    The allusion  is to the games instituted  at Drepanum by Aeneas in honour of Anchises (Virgil, <I>Aen. </I>v). 43.  1. The title was probably that of Patrician.    Magnus Felix was never consul.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Tua felicitate. </I>Such punning plays upon personal names have a peculiar attraction for Sidonius. Cf. II. xiii, <I>Tuus Maximus maxima </I>. . . <I>documento; </I>IV. xxii, (<I>Gaudentius</I>)<I> gaudeat; </I>IX. ix, play on the name Faustus, &amp;c. Cf. Introduction, p. cxxix.
</P>
<P>
3. The reference is to the rash action of Lucius Papirius Cursor in giving battle in the absence of Fabius from the army. Cf. Livy, viii. 29-35. Sidonius says the same thing to Claudianus Mamertus. See IV. iii.
</P>
<P>
48. 1. <I>Infortunatam fecunditatem. </I>An echo of the phrase of Tacitus: <I>Infelici fecunditate fortunae totiens obnoxia (Ann.</I>
ii. 75).
</P>
<P>
49. 1. <I>Injuste tibi justa persoluta. </I>Cf. III. iv, xii; VII. xvii; and Ovid, <I>Met. </I>ii. 627.
</P>
<P>
2. The situation of the villa of Prusianum is thought to coincide with Bresis on the Garden, lying on the main road between Nimes and Clermont. Cf. below, note 51. 3.
</P>
<P>
3. Aracynthus, a mountain in Aetolia or Acarnania; it is uncertain what Mt. Nysa is here intended.
</P>
<P>
50. 1. <I>Sphaeristarum contrastantiumparia.   </I>Cf. note 41. 1.
</P>
<P>
2. This passage is interesting as a description of the library in a Roman villa, but is tantalizing by its incompleteness,
like the allusions of Cicero to the rooms where he kept his
books (<I>Ep. </I>IV. v; VI. viii).
</P>
<P>
We gather that there were high cases <I>(armaria) </I>round the walls as in the small library discovered at Herculaneum, with shelves on which rolls were laid horizontally, with the <I>umbilicus </I>outwards; the <I>armaria </I>must also have had higher shelves for the books or <I>codices, </I>which were now in common use. Boethius in his <I>Consolation of Philosophy </I>indicates that in his time <I>armaria </I>were glazed and ornamented with ivory; in addition to the book cases there are desks (<I>plutei</I>),<I> </I>on which books in use were laid. For the library of Consentius in the villa Octaviana near Narbonne, cf. VIII. iv. See also Justus
<A NAME="p224"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|224</SPAN></A>
Lipsius, <I>De Bibliothecis, </I>Synt. ix; Marquardt, <I>Privatleben, </I>p. 115. The <I>Athenaeum, </I>at Rome, where authors read or recited their compositions, was founded by Hadrian; but the provincial capital had also its Athenaeum, as, for instance, Lyons (IV. viii; IX. ix). In earlier times authors gave their readings in the houses of wealthy men, who kindly lent a large apartment for the purpose; the custom, which was a necessary part of 'publication', is frequently mentioned by Pliny and other authors.
</P>
<P>
51. 1. Turranius Rufinus, born in the mid-fourth century and baptized about 372. He remained in the East for twenty-six years, and shared the admiration which Jerome at one time felt for Origen. On his return to Italy, he translated into Latin Pamphilus' Apology for Origen, and the latter's books
<font face="SPIonic">
Peri\<I> </I>a)rxw~n</font>.<I> </I>He died in Sicily, <I>c. </I>410. Adamantius was a person in the Dialogue
<font face="SPIonic">
Peri\ th~j ei0j Qeo_n o)rqh~j pi/stewj</font>,<I> </I>held by Rufinus to be a work of Origen, but no longer so regarded. Cf. the edition by Van de Sande Bakhuyzen in the series: <I>Die christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten dreijahrhwtderte,
</I>Leipzig, 1901.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Clepsydrae. </I>The water-clocks mentioned by Sidonius appear to belong to the class strictly described as 'hydraulic horologia'. In the simpler forms of these instruments, the water rose from one level to another, and from mark to mark on the sides of the receptacle into which it poured. In more elaborate types lines were engraved on a cylinder or column, to which an indicator, actuated by rising water, pointed. Clepsydrae of this kind only became common in the early Christian centuries. See Daremberg and Saglio, <I>Dict. des antiquites grecques et romaines, </I>iii, p. 261 f. Cf. also Marquardt, <I>Privatleben, </I>p. 256.

2. The extemporized vapour-bath here described recalls the customs of eastern Europe, Asia, and primitive America.

54. 1. This description of the church of Patiens at Lyons presents several features of interest. It was built close to the junction of the Rhone and Saone, near the road from Lyons to Narbonne, and replaced the earlier church of the Maccabees (the first martyrs of Lyons were so called), built by Zachariah, successor of Irenaeus. After it received the relics of St. Justus, it was called by his name, and under this appellation was probably known to Sidonius (V. xvii); it was destroyed by the Huguenots in 1562 (Fertig, ii, p. 37). Its dedication was celebrated by a festival which lasted a whole week, and was signalized by an address from Faustus, Bishop of Riez (IX. ii), at which Sidonius was present. The church seems to have been a basilica, orientated, and with an atrium of the usual type. (Cf. H. Holtzinger, <I>Die altchristliche Architektur in systematischer Darstellung, </I>1889, pp. 53, 70, 179; Chaix, i, p. 322.) Most commentators take lines 16-21 of the poem as referring to the wealth of columns in the interior of the building; but it would seem that Sir Thomas Jackson is right in making the words apply to the atrium. (<I>Byzantine and Romanesque Architecture, </I>ii, p. 31.) They run:

78. 1. <I>Avi. </I>The prefect Apollinaris, on whom see p. clxi. 2. <I>Tam bustualibus favillis quam cadaveribus. </I>This passage, with others in the Letters, seems to imply that cremation was still practised in Gaul in Sidonius' time. See Introduction, p. cxiv. The cemetery here mentioned was just outside the church of St. Just at Lyons (see note 54. 1 above), which itself lay on the edge of the town.
</P>
<P>
79. 1. The words are: <I>torsi latrones. </I>Ampere <I>(Hist. litt. de la France meridionale, </I>ii, p. 233) considered that Sidonius had the men subjected to torture at the grave-side; in this he is followed by Germain. But the simpler meaning seems preferable, though the law certainly prescribed torture (Mommsen, <I>Theodosiani Libri XVI, </I>vol. I, pt. ii, pp. 463 ff.; II, p. 114).

2. The reference is probably to Patiens, Bishop of Lyons, for whom see p. clxxv.

83. 1. <I>Vesicarum ruptor fractorque ferularum. </I>The close association of these two epithets seems to justify Savaron's view that <I>vested </I>should be taken literally, and not metaphorically, in the sense of 'bombast'. His reference to Seneca, <I>Nat.

11. 1. Below, and in the sixth Letter of this book, Faustinus is described as <I>antistes, </I>which should mean 'bishop' (but cf. note 23. 2). The word 'frater', as applied to him, is not to be taken literally. Sidonius uses it of various persons with whom he was on a footing of intimacy, or of those whom he regarded as his sons in Christ.

12. 1. <I>Gozolas, </I>a Jew. Cf. III. iv. Under the Franks, Jews were expelled or baptized by force. (Gregory, <I>Hist. Franc. </I>V. xi, VI. xvii; cf. Gregory the Great, <I>Ep. </I>i. 45.) It is interesting to note that Chilperic had a Jewish furnisher of objects of art and luxury, who resisted conversion by Gregory of Tours <I>(Hist. Franc, </I>VI. v). For the relations of the Ostrogoths with Jews, cf. Cassiodorus, <I>Variae, </I>IV. xliii, V. xxxvii. The present Letter perhaps alludes to the mission of the quaestor Licinianus, sent from Rome to treat with the Goths on the subject of Auvergne. Cf. III. vii.

28. 1. Auvergne was perhaps at this time already under the dominion of Euric, whose hostility to Catholicism had proved disastrous to the Catholic churches, because he kept sees and parishes vacant, so that the fabrics fell into disrepair and new buildings were not erected.

33. 1. Perpetuus, Bishop of Tours, rebuilt in 470 the old church erected by St. Brice over the remains of St. Martin. The new church was not as durable as Sidonius hoped, and had to be rebuilt by Gregory of Tours. (<I>Hist. Franc. </I>II. xiv; IV. xx; X. xxxi.) It had been set on fire by Wiliachair
<A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A>
and his wife, and the inscription of Sidonius perished in the flames. (<I>Hist. Franc. </I>IV. xx.) Gregory describes the church as 160 feet long by 60 feet broad, the height 'to the vault' being 45 feet. It had 32 windows in the nave, and 20 in the presbytery. The whole building had thus 52 windows. It had 120 columns, of which 41 were in the choir, and 8 doors, of which 5 were in the same part of the building. This description by Gregory long ago made it clear to archaeologists that the church of Perpetuus was a vaulted building, part of which was of the 'central' type, and allied to the memorial churches of the Christian East (H. Hübsch, <I>Die altchristlichen Kirchen nach den Baudenkmalen, </I>1862, p. 108 and plate xlviii, figs. 6-9; J. Quicherat, <I>Revue archeologique, </I>1869-70, and <I>Melanges d'arch. et d'histoire, </I>1886; G. Dehio and G. von Bezold, <I>Die kirchliche Baukunst des Abendlandes, </I>i, p. 267): in these peculiarities the church built by Namatius, described by Gregory in the same chapter, must have shared. The excavations carried out on the site of the old church of St. Martin during a series of years ending in 1887, confirmed these anticipations in a striking manner, revealing a round-ended choir with five projecting chapels (hemicycles), concentric with an interior columned space which must have enclosed the shrine (plan in G. Dehio's article in <I>Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen,
</I>x; 1889, pp. 13ff.). The dimensions were found to agree closely with those given by Gregory; and it became certain that the plan was inspired by such memorial churches as those erected by Constantine in the Holy Land, the combination of a basilican nave with a choir on the 'central' system, especially recalling the arrangement of the <I>Anastasis, </I>or church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. The choir of St. Martin's was, in fact, as Dehio observed, half a ' Central-Bau'. This analogy with the <I>Anastasis </I>and other Eastern memorial types, together with the correspondence of the remains with Gregory's dimensions, makes the presumption very strong that whether the actual fabric of the choir discovered is of Perpetuus' time, or a reconstruction of some centuries later (as R. de Lasteyrie, <I>Mem. de
l'Acad. des Inscriptions,</I> <A NAME="p233"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|233</SPAN></A>
xxxiv, pp. I ff., and <I>L'architecture religieuse en France a l'epoque romane, </I>1912, p. 38), the lines of the original building were very closely followed. The salient points of interest are: (a) that Perpetuus in A.D. 470, having to build a church to contain a shrine visited by great numbers of pilgrims, adopted a style of architecture approved elsewhere as most suited for this particular purpose, but hitherto unknown in Gaul; and (b) that the type of choir thus introduced was the point of departure from which the 'chevet' of French Romanesque and Gothic architecture developed (Dehio, as above, pp. 21 ff.). The erection of Perpetuus' church was, therefore, no ordinary occurrence, but an epoch-making event in the history of Western architecture, and, as already remarked in the Introduction, p. ciii, it is curious that Sidonius seems to have seen nothing very remarkable in it beyond its splendour. It was vaulted throughout, probably with barrel-vaults (Dehio, p. 26, note 3); but Hubsch's conjecture that it had a central dome with numerous colonnettes, would appear to be somewhat problematical. In any case, with the church built by Namatius, it must have formed a complete contrast to the plain basilican type with wooden roof, such as the church of Patiens at Lyons. (Note 54. 1.) 2. Gregory of Tours (<I>Hist. </I>XI. xxxi) describes Perpetuus as sixth, not after St. Martin, but after St. Gatien; in <I>Hist. </I>II. xiv he mentions him as fifth after St. Martin.

35. 1. The arms and equipments which follow, suggest that this young prince was a Frank rather than a Burgundian. The skin garments of his suite may be the <I>rhenones, </I>so called because worn by peoples of the Rhine: <I>securis missilis </I>may be the <I>francisca, </I>and <I>lanceus uncatus </I>the <I>angon. </I>Cf. Introduction, p. xciii. The description, which has attracted the notice of all historians of the fifth century, gives a vivid picture of the wealth of the barbaric princes and the splendour of their attire. Prince Sigismer was to wed a Burgundian princess, perhaps the daughter of Chilperic (Schmidt, <I>Geschichte, </I>p. 380).

Maximus lent the money when a layman, but as cleric he still considers himself entitled to both principal and interest, only remitting the latter when he hears that the borrower is mortally ill and in difficulties. The tenor of the Letter shows that Sidonius considers his friend perfectly justified in his claims, and that he regards any remission as an act of grace.

54. 1. <I>Varicosi Arpinatis. </I>Sidonius refers to Cicero more than once as 'the Arpinate'; he is fond of describing an author as of the city of his birth or residence. <I>Varicosus </I>is presumably applied to Cicero, because as an orator he was continually standing and therefore subject to varicose veins.

2. <I>Magistro militum Chilperico. </I>Schmidt considers that the Chilperic in question can only be Chilperici I, sole king of the Burgundians, for he alone would be qualified to bear this imperial title: the word <I>tetrarcha </I>in the next Letter he regards as a mere literary epithet, after Sidonius' manner. Chilperic II, nephew of Chilperic I, was more strictly a 'tetrarch', for he shared sovereignty with three brothers, of whom Gundobad, as the eldest, reigned at Lyons, Chilperic himself holding his court at Vienne. (Schmidt, <I>Geschichte, </I>pp. 376, 380.) For the office of <I>magister militum, </I>cf. Reid in C. M. H. i, p. 46.

2. This passage makes mention of several minor offices; civil or municipal, which in Gaul as in Italy, the barbaric administration had to retain. The municipium elected to the office of <I>flamen </I>from the ranks of the <I>decuriones, </I>and this, priesthood was regarded as conferring dignity upon electors and elected (Marquardt, <I>Romische Staatsverwaltung, </I>pp. 173, 326). The phrase <I>munuscula legatis </I>is perhaps explained by Cassiodorus, <I>Variae, </I>VII. xxxiii, where the present <I>(humanitas) </I>given to an ambassador is mentioned as a customary gift. On minor offices in the imperial and municipal service, see Marquardt, as above, i, pp. 92, 558 ff.; ii, 298 ff.; T. Hodgkin, <I>The Letters of Cassiodorus, </I>p. 108.

58. 1. Sidonius alludes to Chilperic and his queen as Tarquin the Elder and his consort Tanaquil, who is said to have commanded in his household. (Cf. Juvenal, <I>Sat. </I>iii. 566.) Tarquin was originally styled Lucumo; he was the son of Demaratus of Tarquinii in Etruria.

3. Ablabius or Ablavius, whose authorship of the verses is only mentioned by Sidonius, was <I>Praefectus praetorio </I>A.D. 326-37. He was a favourite of Constantine, who at one time gave him charge of his son Constantius. The new emperor, however, stripped Ablavius of his dignities, exiled him to Bithynia, and countenanced his assassination. The blood-guiltiness here implied would seem at first sight to apply with less force to Chilperic I than to his nephew
<A NAME="p237"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|237</SPAN></A>
Gundobad, who, exiled by his brothers Chilperic II and Godomar, finally repossessed himself of Lyons, killing Chilperic and murdering his queen and children. But if the preceding Letter refers to the first Chilperic, it seems probable that this does also. Cf. note 55. 2 above.
</P>
<P>
60. 1. Fausta, wife of Constantine, accused Crispus, son of that emperor by Minervina, of a guilty passion. The emperor sentenced Crispus to death; but on the discovery of his innocence, Fausta was herself put to death by suffocation in the vapour of a hot bath. Sidonius is the earliest authority for the statement that Crispus died by poison. It may be noted that he does not take the more favourable view of Constantine's character. Cf. Introduction, p. cxxv.
</P>
<P>
2. If the two preceding Letters are concerned with the times of Chilperic I, it seems probable that this too is of his period, and not that of his nephews. Cf. notes 55. 2, 59. 3.
</P>
<P>
3. Apollinaris (cf. III. xii), grandfather of Sidonius, was Prefect of the Gauls. (See Introduction, pp. xii and clxi.) (Decimus) Rusticus, grandfather of Aquilinus, held the same office in 410-11 trader the tyrant Constantine (III). Captured by the generals of Honorius, Rusticus was rudely handled. Cf. Gregory of Tours, <I>Hist. Franc. </I>II. ix.
</P>
<P>
4. Jovinus assumed the purple in Gaul while the tyrant Constantine was still alive, but was killed at Narbonne in 412. Dardanus was Prefect in Gaul under Honorius in 409-10; a more favourable view of his character than that of Sidonius is taken by Jerome and Augustine. For the inscription commemorating the opening by Dardanus of a mountain road near Sisteron, cf. C. I. L. xii. 1524,

Gerontius, general of the tyrant Constantine in Spain, raised Maximus to the purple and besieged Constantine in Arles; on the appearance of Constantius before that city, and the desertion of his own troops, he fled into Spain, where he died.

61. 1. The offices of tribune and notarius were in like manner both borne by the grandfather of Cassiodorus in the reign of Valentinian III. The first was military, corresponding to our 'colonel', the second was secretarial, involving

64. 1. The enforced service of Calminius was probably exceptional; for though Gallo-Romans served in the Burgundian army, it was not the habit of the Visigoths to admit them to their ranks. (L. Schmidt, <I>Geschichte, </I>p. 294.)

2. The description of the ball-play in this Letter would be more interesting if we could form an idea of the rules of the game. From the fact that a number of players are engaged, and that violent collisions occur, w,e may hazard a guess that it is the <I>Harpastum</I> (a(rpasto&amp;n),<I> </I>in which one player throws the ball high in the air, and the others run forward to seize it before he can catch it again.

84. 1. Lit. <I>auctoritas coronae tuae. </I>The clerical 'crown' is the tonsure, and the word <I>corona </I>is used to designate a priest, as <I>purpura </I>to signify an emperor. Cf. VII. viii.

<P>
2. <I>Vargus, </I>as we gather from the Ripuarian and Salic laws of the Franks (cf. <I>Lex Salica, </I>xiv, <I>add. </I>5, and lv. 2), literally meant, in the Teutonic dialect, one 'outlawed', or exiled from his country. (Cf. Sirmond, Notes, p. 65.) The episode to which this letter relates is rather difficult to follow. Most commentators have assumed that the woman was carried off from Clermont to Troyes. But Sidonius commonly uses <I>iste </I>for 'this', and <I>istic </I>for 'here' (cf. VIII. ix. 15, line 17 of the poem: <I>nos istic positos, </I>i.e. here, at Bordeaux); it seems probable, therefore, that when he says <I>isto deductam . . . isticque distractam, </I>he is referring to Clermont. The victim may have been abducted from some other place in or near Auvergne, and taken to the market at Clermont to be sold, afterwards passing into the control of Sidonius' man of affairs <I>(negotiator noster) </I>or of some man of business with whom he was acquainted ('<I>our friend the banker</I>'<I>----</I>Hodgkin). The necessity for a visit by the parties to Troyes would, on this theory, arise simply from the fact that Prudens, whose evidence was essential, had returned to his home in that city. The Vargi in many respects resembled the Bagaudae of a rather earlier time.

88. 1. <I>Epistulam formatam. </I>The 'formal' or canonical letter was an attestation given by the bishop to priests and clerks of his diocese when they travelled abroad; without it they were not admitted to the sacrament or to ecclesiastical functions in the districts which they visited. The bishop himself had to obtain a similar letter from the metropolitan or primate when he travelled. Such letters were a safeguard against deception at a time when privilege of clergy made imposture profitable, and they were drawn up with great care. The letters authorizing temporary absence were called <I>Commendatitiae
</I>(ei0rhnikai/, sustatikai/); those accorded when the applicant did not intend to return were styled <I>dimissoriae </I>(a)polutikai/).<I> </I>See Sirmond, Notes, p. 66; Gregoire and Collombet, ii. 146-7, with the references there given; and Fertig, ii, p. 36.

128. 1. <I>Antistes. </I>This word usually signifies a bishop; but the terms of the present letter hardly suggest that dignity for Himerius. Claudianus Mamertus, a simple priest, is elsewhere described as <I>antistes ordine in secundo </I>(IV. xi); it seems probable that the word should also be understood 'of the second order' in the present place, and that Himerins had not attained episcopal rank. (See Gregoire and Collombet, ii. 269-70.) In this case the words <I>dignitatis auctorem
</I>would imply that he was ordained by Lupus. <A NAME="p244"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|244</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

129. 1. The point of the Letter is that Sidonius, who has never seen his correspondent, claims, on the ground of a common culture, a greater intimacy with Philagrius than any mere neighbours in whom such culture was lacking. He reinforces his opinion, which he seems to hold with unnecessary emphasis, with some parade of scientific argument. The philosophical ideas here developed are derived from Platonism (cf. Chaix, i, p. 355 f.), but the manner is reminiscent of Seneca.

130. 1. The allusion is to encaustic painting in which the colour is mixed with wax, applied in a molten state with a spatula.

4. The Euphrates, by which Abraham was born, was also one of the rivers of Paradise.
</P>
<P>
5. <I>Lirinensium sive Grinincensium. </I>For Lerins, see note 80. 1.  The Grinincenses were a community dwelling at Grigny, on the Rhone, not far from Vienne. (Tillemont, <I>Memoires, </I>xvi, p. 259.) The community founded by Abraham at Clermont became the monastery of St. Cirgues.
</P>
<P>
136. 1. <I>A te principium, tibi desinet. </I>Virgil, <I>Ecl. </I>viii. ii. Cf. I. i.
</P>
<P>
140. 1. Apollonius of Tyana, if not often openly attacked, was as a rule viewed with disfavour by the Church, and regarded as something of a charlatan. Cf. J. S. Phillimore, <I>Philostratus in honour of Apollonius of Tyana, </I>Oxford, 1912, Introduction, pp. xciv. ff.
</P>
<P>
2. Nicomachus and Tascius Victorianus were two scholars who corrected and revised current editions of ancient authors, just as Sidonius himself corrected the Heptateuch for Ruricius (V. xv).
</P>
<P>
3. <I>Translatio. </I>Sirmond, arguing from other occurrences of this word in Sidonius (e.g. IX. xi, xvi), considers that it here means transcription. It may, however, as Fertig thinks (Part ii, p. 22), bear its proper sense; if so, the translation has not survived.
</P>
<P>
4. The fortress or castle of Livia, where Sidonius was confined by Euric, was between Carcassonne and Narbonne. Cf. Introduction, p. xliv.
</P>
<P>
141. 1. The peoples beyond the sea and on the Waal are the Vandals of Africa, and the Franks respectively.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
 145. 1. Virg. <I>Georg. </I>iv. 176; <I>Ecl. </I>i. 23.&nbsp; <A NAME="p246"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|246</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
146. 1. Turcius Rufius Astyrius, or Asterius (as his name is usually written), consul with Protogenes in 449. Some of his 'consular diptychs' are preserved, and the words <I>datique fasti </I>may refer, as Sirmond suggests, to the distribution of such diptychs. The <I>sportula </I>might take the form of silver baskets. Cf. Symmachus, <I>Ep. </I>ii. 81; ix. 109.
</P>
<P>
147. 1. This was a law of Theodosius promulgated in Constantinople twenty-five years before the consulship of Asterius, but not in force in Gaul until the latter date. Cf. Sirmond, Notes, p. 85; Th. Mommsen, <I>Theodosiani Libri XVI, </I>vol. I, pt. ii, p. 194.
</P>
<P>
148. 1. Amyclae, situated on the coast of Italy between Gaeta and Terracina (?), was a colony of Sparta, and may be held to have inherited a reputation for Laconism. Virgil (<I>Aen. </I>x. 564) calls it <I>tacitae, </I>and Servius, in his Commentary, gives more than one conjectural reason for the epithet, in addition to that mentioned above. (Cf. Gregoire and Collombet, ii. 365.) But the Laconian Amyclae may be intended. 2. <I>Vitruvius . . . Columella. </I>Well-known writers, the first on architecture, the second on agriculture. Vitruvius lived in the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Columella in that of Claudius.
</P>
<P>
149. 1. The statement that the Saxons returned to their homes '<I>de continenti</I>' rather suggests that they came from islands which might either be situated off the coast of Schleswig or even be themselves the British Isles. For the evidence as to Saxon settlement in England before the middle of the fifth century, see Beck in C. M. H. pp. 382 ff.
</P>
<P>
Namatius was 'admiral' for Euric on the Atlantic seaboard, with the duty of beating off piratical attacks.
</P>
<P>
150. 1. M. Terentius Varro (116-28 B.C.), a voluminous writer who produced nearly 500 books on historical, scientific, and antiquarian subjects. His <I>Logistorics </I>were probably dialogues like those of Cicero. Eusebius of Caesarea, the chronographer (A.D. 265-338), sought to confirm the data of the Bible. His work is divided into two parts, the <I>Chronographia </I>containing the material for the synthetic treatment of the second part or <I>Canones, </I>which gives the rulers of
<A NAME="p247"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|247</SPAN></A>
the world in parallel columns, with notes, while a separate column gives the years of the world's age. The Canons were translated by Jerome. Cf. J. B. Bury, Gibbon's <I>Decline and Fall, </I>II, Appendix i; Stewart in C. M. H. i, p. 582.
</P>
<P>
151. 1. The Emperor Julius Nepos began his reign by an attempt to render the civil and military services more efficient.
</P>
<P>
152. 1. Serranus and Camillus are quoted as examples of illustrious Romans of the Republican period devoted to rural life. Serranus was an <I>agnomen </I>of Regulus, who was actually engaged in sowing when his elevation to the consulship was announced to him in 257 B.C.
</P>
<P>
153. 1. Racilia was the wife of Cincinnatus.
</P>
<P>
154. 1. <I>Satur est cum dicit Horatius Evohe. </I>Juvenal, <I>Sat. </I>vii. 62. The poet suggests that a well-nourished system is essential to the production of good poetry, and that when Horace wrote <I>Od. </I>ii. 19 he had dined well.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Necdum enim quidquam de hereditate socruali vel in usum tertiae sub pretio medietatis. </I>One of the most difficult passages in the Letters. Mommsen <I>(Praefatio, </I>p. xlvii) supposes Sidonius to have the usufruct of a third of the property, on condition that he is to buy half of the estate from the heirs, of whom he is not one----a supposition which presents various difficulties. Equal difficulties attend the effort to represent the third part as the <I>tertia </I>exacted from Roman landowners by their Teutonic conquerors. In the translation, I have adopted a suggestion kindly made by Prof. J. S. Reid, who, however, thinks it rather daring for definite adoption, because there is no authority for <I>medietas </I>as anything but a half-share. I have taken the risk of another rendering, because Sidonius employs several Latin words in an irregular and unclassical way, and it seems quite possible that he may here use <I>medietas </I>in the general sense of 'portion', as 'moiety' is sometimes used in English.
</P>
<P>
3. Sidonius was now detained by Euric at Bordeaux. See Introduction, p. xlv.
</P>
<P>
155. 1. A town in Phocis, sacred to Apollo. For the Boeotian Muses (<I>Hyantiae Camenae</I>), cf. <I>Carm. </I>ix. 285.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Istic positos, </I>i.e. at Bordeaux.    The following lines, <A NAME="p248"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|248</SPAN></A>
with their ethnographical details, are perhaps the best known in Sidonius. (Cf. Introduction, p. xciii.) The 'glaucous' cheeks of the Herulians were perhaps painted rather than tattooed. The tribe was settled on the Lower Rhine (cf. Cassiodorus, <I>Variae, </I>III. iii), and their representatives were probably at Bordeaux, because Euric was regarded as their protector against Frankish aggression. (Schmidt, <I>Geschichte, </I>pp. 268-9, note 5). Italy's prayer for aid in expelling the barbarian may refer to the Roman desire for the expulsion of Odovakar (ibid.).
</P>
<P>
156. 1. <I>Arsaces </I>is here used for a monarch of the later Sassanian dynasty----Peroz, or Firoze, at this time engaged in hostilities with the White Huns, who were encouraged by the East Roman Empire. (Procopius, <I>De Bella Persico, </I>I. iv; Tabari, <I>Geschichte der Perser and Araber, </I>Noldeke's ed., p. 119.)
</P>
<P>
157. 1. <I>Meliboeus esse coepi. </I>The reference is to Virgil's Eclogue, where Meliboeus is the countryman dispossessed of his lands.
</P>
<P>
2. This maxim does not occur in the writings of Symmachus which have come down to us.
</P>
<P>
158. 1. Cf. Pliny, <I>Ep. </I>i, 20, and vi. 33. The most famous speech of each orator is quoted.
</P>
<P>
159. 1. Vesunnici and Nitiobroges.
</P>
<P>
2. Drepanius, author of a panegyric on Theodosius. Anthedius, a poet mentioned elsewhere by Sidonius. Paulinus, perhaps a rhetor of Perigueux, though there is more than one person of the name who might be intended here. Alcimus, orator and poet, whose real name was Alethius. On these personages see <I>Hist. Litt. de la France, </I>i, p. 419; ii, pp. 136-8, 469, 537.
</P>
<P>
160.  1. Orpheus.
</P>
<P>
2. A Thracian huntress-goddess, 'Or she', &amp;c. The reference is to Atalanta.
</P>
<P>
3. The text is:
</P>
<blockquote>

</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Possibly the <I>compagus </I>may be the kind of shoe described. Cf. Marquardt, <I>Privatleben, </I>p. 589.
</P>
<P>
162. 1. <I>Echoicos.   </I>Sirmond quotes the following lines of Pentadius, to illustrate the meaning of <I>versus echoici: Per cava saxa sonat pecudum mugitibus Echo Voxque repulsa iugis per cava saxa sonat. </I>For the <I>versus recurrens, </I>or palindrome, see note 207. 1.
</P>
<P>
'By repetitions' <I>(per anadiplosin). </I>Repetition is a poetical artifice commonly employed by Virgil, e.g.:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sequitur pulcherrimus Astur,&nbsp;<br>
 Astur equo fidens, </I>&amp;c.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
164. 1. For a concise statement of the elements of astrological belief in Roman times, see Daremberg and Saglio, article <I>Divinatio, </I>p. 302. Also A. Maury, <I>La magie et l'astrologie dans l'antiquite, </I>1862; F. Lenormant, <I>La divination et la science des presages chez les Chaldeens, </I>1875; A. Habler, <I>Astrologie im Alterthum, </I>1879. Of the persons mentioned in the next paragraph, Vertacus, Thrasybulus, and Saturninus, the first and third are named as mathematicians in the letter to Leontius preceding <I>Carm. </I>xxii.
</P>
<P>
166. 1. Langon (Alingo) is on the left bank of the Garonne, south-east of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Catonis in Syrte. </I>Cato with ten thousand men crossed the desert of Leptis in thirty days. The exploit, which became almost legendary, is recorded by Strabo and Lucan.
</P>
<P>
167. 1. <I>Tabula calculis strata bicoloribus. </I>This mention of a board, with men of two colours, seems to confirm the belief that the game played by Theodoric was something akin to backgammon. Cf. p. 216, note 5. 1.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Medulicae supellectilis epulones. </I>The oysters of Medoc were famous even in Rome. Cf. Ausonius, <I>Ep. </I>vii and ix.
</P>
<P>
170. 1. Cf. p. 239, note 80. 1.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Archimandritas. </I>An archimandrite, in the Orthodox Eastern Church, approximately corresponds to an abbot in the West.
<A NAME="p250"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|250</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
172. 1. The prophecy of St. Annianus (Aignan) is recorded by Gregory of Tours <I>(Hist. Franc. </I>ii. 7). Orleans was hard pressed by Attila, and the bishop promised succour from Aetius. That general arrived at the very moment when the walls of the town were breached, and prevented the Huns from entering the city. The story is not accepted by modern historical criticism.
</P>
<P>
173. 1.   Juvenal, <I>Sat. </I>i. 5-6.
</P>
<P>
174. 1. Cf. Symmachus, <I>Ep. </I>iii. to Siburius, quoted by Sirmond: <I>Si tibi vetustatis tantus est amor, pari studio in verba prisca redeamus, quibus Salii canunt, </I>&amp;c.
</P>
<P>
176. 1. The tenth book of the younger Pliny's letters contains only the correspondence between himself and Trajan, and Sidonius does not count it as one of the collection.
</P>
<P>
177. 1. For <I>Levites </I>or <I>Levita, </I>signifying 'deacon', cf. C. H. Turner in C. M. H. i, p. 157.
</P>
<P>
180. 1. Cf. p. 239, note 80. i.
</P>
<P>
2. An allusion to the loss of Sidonius' estate. Sirmond considers this letter to have been written when Sidonius was in exile at Bordeaux. Cf. VIII. ix.
</P>
<P>
181. 1. <I>Paginam rusticantem.    </I>Cf. Introduction, p. cxxvi. 183.  1. The treaty of peace between Julius Nepos and Euric.
</P>
<P>
187. 1. Joshua ix. The Gibeonites were made hewers of wood and drawers of water for endeavouring to avoid servitude by pretending that their city was far off, when it was really near.
</P>
<P>
188. 1. <I>Aptae fuistis, aptissime defuistis.   </I>One of the worst examples of Sidonius' delight in puns and verbal jugglery. 2. <I>Satis eloquentiae, sapientiae parum. </I>Cf. Sallust, <I>Cat</I>. v. 4.
</P>
<P>
189. 1. <I>Riochatus antistes ac monachus, atque istius mundi bis peregrinus. </I>It seems uncertain whether Riochatas had been made a bishop in Brittany, or whether he was a priest 'of the second order'. Cf. note 126. 1.
</P>
<P>
190. 1. On Sassanian textiles and embossed silver dishes the hunter is sometimes depicted holding a cub in each hand. Cf. note 203. 1.
</P>
<P>
2. The book was probably one of those in which Faustus established the divinity of the Son and the Holy Ghost against the Arians, and not, as Ampère suggested
<A NAME="p251"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|251</SPAN></A>
(<I>Hist. litt. de la France, </I>ii, p.  250), his  work  on  Grace. (Chaix, ii, p. 143.)
</P>
<P>
192.  1. Deut. xxi. 11-13.
</P>
<P>
193. 1. The list of philosophers is interesting in connexion with artistic (sculptural?) types, upon which the several descriptions appear to be based.
</P>
<P>
194. 1. Units were counted on the left hand, hundreds on the right. (Pliny, xxxiv. 7; Juvenal, <I>Sat. </I>x.<I> </I>249.) Probably, as Sirmond suggests, Sidonius exaggerates the age of Faustus.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
 2. This letter is of interest for the status of a defaulting clerk. Injuriosus ought to have brought Aprunculus a dimissorial letter from Sidonius. Without this his position was irregular, and he exposed himself to possible retributive action on Sidonius' part. Cf. note 88. 1, and Chaix, ii, p. 102.
</P>
<P>
195. 1. This difficult Letter perhaps refers to an episode in connexion with the issue of the second instalment of the Letters. Sidonius seems to have sent his manuscript to Lupus, but with the request that the bishop, after looking it through, should pass it on to some other person unnamed. This request appears to have offended Lupus, who wrote to Sidonius to air his grievance. Cf. Chaix, ii, p. 283.
</P>
<P>
197. 1. If Lupus was elected bishop in 427, the date of the present Letter is 477. Cf. Duchesne, <I>Fastes episcopaux, </I>ii, p. 449.
</P>
<P>
199. 1. This passage again suggests a date. Assuming Sidonius to have been elected bishop in 472, the year when he presumably abandoned secular poetry, the present Letter, as Baronius pointed out, would have been written in 484.
</P>
<P>
201. 1. The passage testifies to the lively interest of Sidonius in metrical questions. Form, with him, was of no less importance than matter.
</P>
<P>
2. i.e. Apuleius, of Madaura in Africa.
</P>
<P>
202. 1. <I>Magistri Epistularum. </I>Petrus was secretary of Majorian. See p. clxxvi.
</P>
<P>
2. i.e. Arles.    Sidonius was there with Majorian in 461. See Introduction, p. xxiii.
</P>
<P>
203. 1. Sirmond quotes Ammianus Marcellinus (Bk. xxiv) for the Babylonian hangings used at the time of Julian's sojourn in Ctesiphon, all representing royal hunting scenes.
<A NAME="p252"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|252</SPAN></A>
The present passage also recalls the well-known Sassanian silk textiles. (Cf. note 190. 1 above.) Niphates, a mountain in Armenia, here represents that country.
</P>
<P>
204. 1. <I>Tepidas ad officinas. </I>The translation given is based on the suggestion of Fertig (i, p. 31), who compares <I>Carm. </I>xxiii. 131: <I>Smyrnaeae incude doctas officinae. </I>The allusion would be to the heat of a busy forge, metaphorically representing a thorough and efficient school of music, dance, and song. <I>Thymele </I>is the platform on which the <I>choregus </I>stood in the middle of the orchestra; <I>pale </I>(lit. 'a place for wrestling') might then be the stage on which mimes appeared. (Cf. <I>Carm. </I>xxiii. 301, 302.) <I>Lepidas </I>has been suggested as an alternative to <I>tepidas.</I>
</P>
<P>
207. 1. <I>Versus recurrentes. </I>Cf. note 162. 1. The second of the two palindrome verses in the text is of unknown origin, and yields no obvious sense (Forcellini, <I>Lexicon, </I>s. v. <I>peredo</I>).<I> </I>Of the first, as given here in isolation, the same might almost be said; but at some time it was attached to a hexameter, so as to form a recurrent couplet, and placed in the mouth of Satan, to enliven the description of a pilgrimage to Rome by a personage variously given as St. Martin, a canon of Combremer, &amp;c. The holy man changes the Devil into a beast of burden, and rides him towards his destination, his impatience arousing the following protest:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
'<I>Signa te, signa; temere me tangis et angis;&nbsp;<br>
 Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor.'</I>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
'Cross, aye, cross thyself; 'tis all for nought that thou strikest and plaguest me, since my paces will soon bring before thee Rome, the goal of thy desire.' Whatever may be the date of the first line, the second is shown by the terms of Sidonius' allusion <I>(illud antiquum) </I>to have been well known in the second half of the fifth century. The invention of recurrent verses was commonly attributed to Sotades, a poet of the third century B.C. The best example in Greek is the
NI&Psi;ON ANOMHMA MH MONAN O&Psi;IN, inscribed on many mediaeval fonts (in England, those of Sandbach, Harlow, Melton Mowbray, Hadley, and others), and traced to the time of the
<A NAME="p253"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|253</SPAN></A> Byzantine Emperor Leo VI (Leo Allatius, <I>Excerpta varia Graecorum Sophistarum, </I>&amp;c., p, 398, 1641; <I>Anthol. Graec. Epigrammatum
</I>VI, xiii, p. 563. Ed. H. Steph. Frankfort, 1600).
</P>
<P>
208. 1. i.e. Livy. The part of his history dealing with the career of Julius Caesar is no longer extant, but it still survived in the time of Sidonius, and Symmachus was acquainted with it (<I>Ep. </I>IV. xvii).
</P>
<P>
2. Some read: Viventius Martialis. Sirmond conjectures that the person intended may be Gargilius Martialis, author of a life of Caesar, cited by Vopiscus and Lampridius. L. Cornelius Balbus, with Oppius, represented Caesar's interests at Rome during the Civil War. No diary of his is now known.
</P>
<P>
3. The custom of bringing a claque to applaud the public reading of a friend was very common during the Roman empire. It is mentioned by Pliny, Juvenal, and other writers.
</P>
<P>
211. 1. <I>Peragratis dioecesibus. Dioecesis </I>is used here in the sense of 'parish'. Cf. Sirmond, Notes, p. 101.
</P>
<P>
212. 1. Mme de Sevigne, writing from Grignan in 1695, complained that the inkstands were frozen in the bitter cold of early February.
</P>
<P>
2. <I>Mytilenaei oppidi vernulas </I>= Sapphics, Sappho being a native of Mytilene.
</P>
<P>
213. 1. <I>Cum meis poni statuam . . . Nerva Trajanus titulis videret. </I>The allusion is to the statue erected in the reign of Avitus, after Sidonius had delivered the panegyric of that emperor. See Introduction, p. xviii. The two libraries are those dedicated respectively to Greek and Latin literature. 2. 1. e. the office of Prefect of Rome, carrying with it the presidency of the Senate, conferred on Sidonius by Anthemius in 468. Cf. Introduction, p. xxix.
</P>
<P>
214. 1. St. Saturninus, first bishop of Toulouse, martyred in the second half of the third century. (Cf. Gregory of Tours, <I>Hist. Franc. </I>I. xxviii, and see <I>Acta Sanctorum, </I>Nov. 29.) The 'Capitol' from which he was flung is that of Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
2. The <I>regula Flacci </I>is contained in the third and fourth verses of <I>Epistle </I>ii:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Amphora coepit&nbsp;<br>
 Institui, currente rota cur urceus exit?</I>
</P>
