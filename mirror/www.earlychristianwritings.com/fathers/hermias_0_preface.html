<p align="left"><A NAME="pvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vii</SPAN></A></p>
<p align="center"><b>IV. HERMIAS.</b></p>
<p>Nothing whatever is known of Hermias, the author of this treatise. Cave
refers him to the second century; but the Benedictine editor of his works thinks
he may with as great probability be ascribed to the third. All agree that he was
later than Justin Martyr, whose words and thoughts he occasionally imitates. The
Benedictine editor considers his whole treatise to be no more than an expansion
of that paragraph in Tatian's work, § 25, &quot;You follow the doctrines of
Plato,&quot; &amp;c. (see page 102 of this volume). The name of philosopher is
given to Hermias in all the manuscript copies of his work, from which it would
seem that, like Justin and others, he was a Gentile philosopher who embraced
Christianity.</p>
<p>The original Greek text of Hermias has been often printed. It first appeared
at Basle, 8vo., 1553, at the end of DEMETRII CYDONII <i>Oratio de contemnenda
morte; </i>and, after several intermediate editions, at the end of Worth's
Tatian, 8vo., Oxon., 1700. But the best edition is at the end of the Benedictine
Justin Martyr, fol., Paris, 1742, until the expected edition of it by Otto, to
correspond with his Justin Martyr, shall be published. The present translation
is the first (as far as I know) that has ever been made into the English
language.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><A NAME="pxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiv</SPAN></A></p>
<p>The translation has been made from the text of Otto for Tatian; from the old
Benedictine edition for Athenagoras, Theophilus, and Hermias; and from the <i>Reliquiae
Sacrae </i>of my late venerable friend Dr. Routh, for the other twenty-one
writers contained in this volume. It was originally intended to give the
Apostolical Fathers in an accompanying volume, so that the present would have
been vol. ii. of the work ; but, as Archbishop Wake's excellent translation is
easily accessible, the idea was abandoned.</p>
