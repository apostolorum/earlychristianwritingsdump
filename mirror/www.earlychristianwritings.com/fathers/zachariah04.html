<p align="center"><b>Zachariah of Mitylene, Syriac Chronicle (1899).&nbsp; Book
4.</b></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">BOOK IV</h3>
<p>THIS fourth Book also, inasmuch as it is from <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><i>
</i>the History of Zachariah the Rhetorican, relates (in its twelve chapters
that are written down distinctly below) and makes known the events occurring
after the death of Marcian, and Morian, and Anthemius, and Severus, and
Olybrius, who reigned in all twelve years, as the Chronicle testifies—these
events (I say) it makes known which took place in Alexandria, and in Ephesus, in
the days of Leo, and Leo, during a period of twenty years. It tells about the
consecration of Timothy the Great, surnamed the &quot;Weasel.&quot; And how
Proterius, who was appointed as the successor of Dioscorus by the Synod of
Chalcedon, was killed; and how, after his death, his clergy presented a libel to
Timothy, and sought to come to the Church; but the zealous priests, on the side
of Timothy, and the people would not allow them. Whereupon they went to Rome,
and informed Leo about the matter; who wrote a letter to Leo the king censuring
the consecration of Timothy.</p>
<p>But this Book, further, tells about the letter of Timothy to Leo censuring
the additions which had been made in the Synod, and the Tome.</p>
<p>And, moreover, it tells about John, who was the bishop in Ephesus after the
resignation of Bassianus; and about the encyclical letter of Leo the king, which
he wrote to the bishops, with the object of eliciting from them their written
opinions respecting the definitions that were made in the Synod. And they all,
with the exception of Amphilochius of Side, wrote in praise of these
definitions. <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Book, further, tells how Timothy was banished to Gangra, and from Gangra
to Cherson ; and that his successor was one of the Proterian party, another
Timothy surnamed Salophaciolus.</p>
<p>And it, moreover, tells about Isaiah the bishop, and Theophilus the
presbyter, who showed themselves to be Eutychians; and about the letter which
Timothy wrote respecting them, and by which he exposed them.</p>
<p>The first chapter tells about the consecration of Timothy the Great, surnamed
the &quot;Weasel&quot;; and the events which then occurred.</p>
<p>The second chapter shows how Proterius was killed, and dragged away; and his
body was burned with fire.</p>
<p>The third chapter explains how after Timothy appeared as the sole bishop, the
other clergy also, who were adherents of Proterius, presented a libel by which
they showed themselves desirous of coming to the Church; but<i> </i>the zealous
priests, on the side of Timothy, would not allow them.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter tells how these men, because they were not received by
Timothy, got ready and went up to Rome and gave information to the chief priest
Leo (respecting the matter).</p>
<p>The fifth chapter tells about Timothy; and also what happened in Ephesus to
John the successor of Bassianus.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter, moreover, explains about the petition<sup> </sup>of
Timothy which he wrote to the king, which contained a censure upon Leo and his
letter.</p>
<p>The seventh chapter tells about the replies to the Encyclical respecting the
Synod, which were sent to Leo the king by the bishops; and how Amphilochius did
not agree with the others in what he wrote.</p>
<p>The eighth chapter tells about the letter of Anatolius to the king, proving
him to have influenced the bishops, as to the purport of their replies
respecting the Synod. <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ninth chapter tells about the banishment of Timothy, and the events which
happened at his departure from Alexandria.</p>
<p>The tenth chapter explains about the other Timothy, who was the bishop of the
Proterian party, and was called Salophaciolus.</p>
<p>The eleventh chapter tells about the removal of Timothy from Gangra to
Cherson.</p>
<p>The twelfth chapter tells about Isaiah and Theophilus, the Eutychians; and
about the letter which Timothy wrote respecting them, and by which he exposed
them.</p>
<p>But the time occupied by this Book is two or three years of Leo the First,
and seventeen years of Leo the Second, less by two months, as the Chronicle
informs us. For Timothy the Great was about two years, more or less, bishop in
Alexandria; and then he was banished to Gangra, and after the lapse of eighteen
years he returned to his see; and he very soon died.</p>
<p>This fourth Book is a narrative of the consecration of Timothy, and of the
events which occurred in the days of King Leo the First, and Leo the Second. <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER I</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE FOURTH BOOK, TELLING ABOUT THE CONSECRATION OF
  TIMOTHY THE GREAT, SURNAMED AELURUS,<i> </i>AND THE EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED THEN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Alexandrian Church being in the condition that we have described above,
suddenly the report of the death of Marcian reached them, and they all took
courage, and consulted with the whole order of the monks as to whom they should
make the bishop of the believing party. For<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> at that
time Dionysius the general was not there, but was on a visit to Egypt.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
And they agreed upon Timothy, a man expert in business and of ascetic life ; who
had been brought from the wilderness, by force, to Cyril, and ordained as
presbyter by him. Moreover, he was of the same faith as Dioscorus ; and he was
well versed in all the truth of the faith of the doctors of the Church. This man
the people of Alexandria along with the monks seized, and brought to the great
Church which is called <i>Caesarian. </i>And they sought for three bishops,
according to the canonical statute, to consecrate him. And since two Egyptian
bishops were present, it was necessary that some other bishop should be found.
And on making diligent inquiry, some of the people heard of Peter the Iberian,
who had left Palestine and was sojourning there in Alexandria. And they ran
quickly and laid hold of the man ; and carried him on their shoulders, not
letting him touch the ground. And as they were bringing him along, a voice was
heard in the minds of the clergy, and of the monks, and of the believing
citizens, like that voice which Philip heard respecting the eunuch of Candace
the queen, saying, &quot;Consecrate him by force, even though he be unwilling,
and set him on the throne <A NAME="p65"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|65</SPAN></A> of
Mark.&quot; And he was weak in body through much self-mortification; so that, on
account of his emaciation, the Proterian party used jestingly to style him the
&quot;Weasel.&quot; And when Dionysius the general<i> </i>heard of the matter,
he became uneasy, lest he might receive blame for there being two bishops in the
city, when the king heard it. And accordingly he returned, and taking the whole
Roman force with him, he made Timothy prisoner. And many were killed. And
Dionysius gave orders that they should carry him off to a place called
Cabarsarin.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> And upon his departure the conflict
between the citizens and the Romans became severe. And there was a great tumult,
and slaughters were matters of daily occurrence; more especially as he
(Dionysius) kept inciting and urging on the Romans called Cartadon, who were
passionate men and Arians. And so the custodian of the Church funds expended
them upon the Romans who were contending with the people. But it happened that
numbers of them and of their wives fell and perished in the conflict. And they
were divided into parties, and fought one against another. And when confusion
like this had prevailed in the city for many days, Dionysius was at his wits'
end, so he brought a certain monk Longinus, celebrated for chastity and virtue,
and he intrusted Timothy to him ; that he might restore the bishop to the city
and to his church, upon the condition that the fighting should cease, and that
there should be no more slaughter.</p>
<p>And when Timothy had returned to the great church from which he had been
forcibly removed, and Proterius had taken for himself the church which is called
<i>Quirinian, </i>and Easter <A NAME="p66"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|66</SPAN></A> time
came round, children without number were brought to Timothy to be baptized; so
that because of their multitude those who were writing and reading out their
names became weary; but only five were brought to Proterius. And the people were
so devotedly attached to Timothy that they drove Proterius out of the church of
Quirinus ; and slaughter ensued.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER II</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SECOND CHAPTER SHOWS HOW PROTERIUS WAS SLAIN, AND DRAGGED THROUGH THE
  CITY ; AND HOW HIS BODY WAS, AT LAST, BURNED WITH FIRE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> when Proterius continued to threaten the
Romans, and to display his rage against them ; because they took his gold, but
did not fill their hands with the blood of his enemies : then, indeed, a certain
Roman was stirred to anger in his heart, and was boiling over with rage ; and he
invited Proterius to look round and he would show him the corpses of the slain
as they lay. And suddenly and secretly, he drew his sword and stabbed Proterius
in the ribs along with his Roman comrades, and they despatched him, and dragged
him to the Tetrapylum, calling out respecting him as they went along, &quot;This
is Proterius.&quot; And others suspected that it was some crafty plot. But the
Romans left the body, and went away. Then the people, perceiving this, became
also greatly excited, and they dragged off the corpse, and burnt it with fire in
the Hippodrome. Thus the end of death overtook Proterius, who had done evil to
the Alexandrians, iust as George the Arian, and he suffered at their hands in
like manner, and so was it done to him. <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER III</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE THIRD CHAPTER TELLS HOW, AFTER TIMOTHY APPEARED AS THE SOLE BISHOP, THE
  OTHER CLERGY ALSO EXPRESSED, BY MEANS OF A LIBEL, THEIR DESIRE TO REPENT AND
  BE UNITED WITH HIM ; BUT THE PEOPLE AND THE ZEALOUS PRIESTS OF HIS PARTY WOULD
  NOT ALLOW THEM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Timothy, when he appeared before them as the only chief priest of
Alexandria, showed that he was really what a priest should be. For the silver
and the gold that were given to the Romans in the days of Proterius, he expended
upon the poor, and the widows, and the entertaining of strangers, and upon the
needy in the city. So that, in a short time, the rich men, perceiving his
honourable conduct, lovingly and devotedly supplied him with funds, both gold
and silver. But the presbyters and all the clergy belonging to the Proterian
party, since they knew all his virtues and his angelic mode of life, and the
devotion of the citizens to him, joined themselves together and made libels in
which they entreated him that they might be received. They also promised that
they would go to Rome to Leo, and admonish him concerning the novelties which he
had written in the Tome. Among these persons there were some who were ready and
eloquent, and of great wealth and dignity, and of high birth also, who had been
called to the clerical order by Cyril; and who were honoured in the eyes of the
citizens of Rome; and they presented the petition on their behalf to Timothy.
And Eustace of Berytus wrote, also recommending their reception.</p>
<p>But the jealousy and hatred of the citizens against these persons were great,
on account of the events which had occurred in the days of Proterius, and the
various sufferings which they had endured. So they would not consent to their
reception, but they prepared the others to cry out, &quot;Not one <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A>
of them shall set his foot here, neither shall the transgressors be
received.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IV</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FOURTH CHAPTER TELLS HOW THESE MEN GOT READY AND WENT UP TO ROME, AND
  GAVE INFORMATION RESPECTING THE TREATMENT WHICH THEY HAD SUFFERED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the reason why matters were disturbed and thrown into confusion. For
when these men were ignominiously refused, they betook themselves to Rome, and
there they told about the contempt of the canons, and about the dreadful death
of Proterius; and they said that he died for the sake of the Synod and for the
honour of Leo; and that they themselves, also, had endured many indignities; and
further, that Timothy had come forward in a lawless manner and taken the
priesthood. So they rendered the latter odious, and made the whole business
appear disgraceful in the eyes of Leo; and they stirred him up against Timothy.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER V</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIFTH CHAPTER TELLS THE FOLLOWING MATTERS RESPECTING TIMOTHY; AND ALSO
  WHAT HAPPENED IN EPHESUS TO JOHN THE SUCCESSOR OF BASSIANUS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how it came about that Timothy was given up, I shall now relate. Marcian
the king having died, and Anthemius, and Severus, and Olybrius having reigned
for only short lives, in Italy and the regions beyond, Leo the First received
the kingdom in the territory of Europe in conjunction with them and after them.
And he was both a believer and vigorous, but simple in the faith. <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when Leo the king learned the evils which occurred in Egypt, and in
Alexandria, and in Palestine, and in every place; and that many had been
disturbed on account of the Synod. And also that in Ephesus there had been much
slaughter, upon the entrance of John, after Bassianus had resigned and fled
because he would not subscribe the transactions of Chalcedon. But this John,
being inflamed with desire for pre-eminence, betrayed the rights and honours of
the see; so that in Ephesus they call him &quot;the traitor&quot; unto this day;
and they blotted his name out of the book of life. He accordingly, when he
received a letter from Timothy of Alexandria, was willing to convene a Synod.
But Anatolius, the bishop of the royal city, prevented him; not, indeed, that he
was able to find any fault with the written statement of Timothy, but he was
very uneasy lest, if a Synod were assembled, it might put an end to all the
transactions of Chalcedon. And his anxiety was not for the faith, but rather for
the privileges and honours which had been unjustly granted to the see of the
royal city.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Anatolius persuaded the king not to assemble a Synod, but by
means of written letters, called <i>Encyclicals, </i>to inquire what the mind of
the bishops was respecting the Synod of Chalcedon and the consecration<i> </i>of
Timothy.</p>
<p>And<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> the king began to write to the bishops about
Timothy and the Synod of Chalcedon, in the encyclical letter, to the following
effect:—</p>
<p>&quot;Do ye, without fear of man or partiality, and unbiassed by influence or
by favour, setting the fear of God alone before your eyes, and considering that
to Him alone ye must make your defence and give your account, tell me briefly
the common opinion held by you the priests in our dominion, what ye think right,
after having carefully investigated the transactions of Chalcedon, and
concerning the consecration of Timothy of Alexandria.&quot; <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> when a letter such as this from the king
was given to Leo of Rome, he wrote two letters to Leo the king; one concerning
Timothy, and the other on behalf of the Proterian party, in which he also
asserted of the clergy of Constantinople that they were of the same mind as
Timothy; and he called Anatolius indolent; and he defended the Tome which he
himself wrote respecting Eutyches, and which was accepted in the Council of
Chalcedon. However, in a similar strain he wrote distinctly concerning the
taking of the Manhood by Christ in this letter also. And Leo the king sent it on
to Timothy of Alexandria. And, upon the receipt of it, the latter wrote a
petition to the king as follows.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VI</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SIXTH CHAPTER, DECLARING, BY HIS PETITION, THE FAITH OF TIMOTHY AND THE
  CHARGES THAT HE MADE AGAINST THE LETTER OF LEO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;O kind and indulgent king! Since among wise men there is nothing more
honourable than the soul, and also we have learned to despise the things of the
flesh, and not to lose the soul; therefore, as far as in me lies and with all my
might, I am careful to keep my soul, lest before the time of judgment I may be
condemned as a lover of the flesh, and prepare for myself the fire of Hell. And
this I think, that all who are wise concerning that which is good, desire that
nothing hateful to their brethren should ever occur. And accordingly, in writing
this petition I assure your Serenity that from my youth I have learned the Holy
Scriptures, and I have studied the divine mysteries contained in them. And even
until now, I have ever been careful to hold the true faith as it was delivered
to us by the apostles, and by my <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A>
fathers the doctors. And, being united to them by the grace of God our Saviour,
I have reached my present age. And I confess the one faith which our Redeemer
and Creator Jesus Christ delivered when He became incarnate, and sent out the
blessed apostles, saying, 'Go, teach all nations; baptizing them in the name of
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.' <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><i> </i>For
<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> the Trinity is perfect, equal of Nature, in glory
and blessedness; and there is not in It anything less or more. For thus also the
three hundred and eighteen blessed fathers taught concerning the true
Incarnation of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that He became man, according
to His dispensation, which He Himself knows. And with them I agree and believe,
as do all others who prosper in the true faith. For in it there is nothing
difficult, neither does the definition of the faith which the fathers proclaimed
require addition. And all (whoever they be) holding other opinions and corrupted
by heresy, are rejected by me. And I also myself flee from them. For this is a
disease which destroys the soul, namely, the doctrine of Apollinaris, and the
blasphemies of Nestorius, both those who hold erroneous views about the
Incarnation of Jesus Christ, Who became flesh from us; and introduce into Him
the cleavage in two, and divide asunder even the dispensation of the
only-begotten Son of God: and those, on the other hand, who say with respect to
His Body that it was taken from Heaven, or that God the Word was changed, or
that He suffered in His own Nature; and who do not confess that to a human body
what pertains to the soul derived from us was united.</p>
<p>&quot;And I say to any who have fallen into one or other of these heresies,
'Ye are in grievous error, and ye know not the Scriptures.'<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
And with such I do not hold communion, nor do I love them as believers. But I am
joined, and united, and truly agreeing with the faith which was defined at
Nicea; and it is my care to live in accordance with it. <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But when Diomedes, the distinguished Silentiarius, came to me and gave
me the letter of the bishop of Rome, and I studied it, and I was not pleased
with its contents; then lest the Church, O Christ-loving man, should be
disturbed, I neither, as yet, have publicly read nor censured it.</p>
<p>&quot;But I believe that God has put it into the mind of your Serenity to set
right the statements in this letter, which are a cause of stumbling to the
believers; for these statements are in accord, and agreement, and conjunction
with the doctrine of Nestorius; who was condemned for cleaving asunder and
dividing the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, in respect of natures, and
persons, and properties, and names, and operations; who also interpreted the
words of Scripture to mean two (natures), which are not contained in the
Confession of Faith of the three hundred and eighteen. For they declared that
the only-begotten Son of God, Who is of the same Nature with the Father, came
down, and became incarnate, and was made man; and suffered, and rose again, and
ascended to Heaven; and shall come to judge the quick and the dead. And natures,
and persons, and properties were not mentioned by them, nor did they divide
them. But they confessed the divine and the human properties to be of One by the
dispensation.</p>
<p>&quot;Accordingly, I do not agree with the transactions of Chalcedon, because
I find in them divisions and cleavage of the dispensation.</p>
<p>&quot;And now, O victorious king, receive me, for I am speaking this
confidently on behalf of the truth; that your Highness may prosper as on earth,
so also in Heaven. And accept this my petition with goodwill, for in this letter
from the West there runs confusion likely to cause stumbling; for it cleaves
asunder the dispensation. And I pray that this letter may be annulled, so that
God Christ may be purely<sup> </sup>confessed by all tongues that He truly
suffered in the flesh; while He remained without suffering in His Godhead, which
He has with the Father and the Spirit.</p>
<p>&quot;And I entreat and beseech your honoured Majesty that <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A>
orders be sent to all men to hold the Confession of the faith, as defined by our
three hundred and eighteen fathers, which, in a few words, declares the truth to
all the Churches, and puts an end to every heresy and all false doctrine and
causes of stumbling; and which itself stands in no need of correction. But the
matters in this letter which appear to me to require correction&quot; (which are
not repeated) &quot;are these—&quot; and because they are given at length with
quotations refuting them, we do not repeat them here, lest the reader should be
wearied. For believers may find, in all places, the censures upon them that have
been made by wise men. In the first place, by Dioscorus; and after him, by this
Timothy; and after him by Peter; and by Akhs'noyo of Hierapolis; and by the
learned Severus, the chief priest of Antioch, in his work <i>Against the
Grammarian</i>;<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> and by Cosmas; and by Simeon of
L'gino; and by the letter of the Alexandrines.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VII</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SEVENTH CHAPTER TELLS WHAT THE OTHER BISHOPS WROTE TO LEO; AND HOW THEY
  ALL (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AMPLILOCHIUS OF SIDE) MADE KNOWN THEIR VIEWS IN
  CONFORMITY WITH THE DOCTRINE OF THE SYNOD, AND AGREED TO IT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Timothy wrote confidently, as above, concerning the letter of Leo and the
Synod of Chalcedon. The other bishops, however, the Metropolitans of every
place, having received the encyclical letter of the king, testified to what was
done by them in Chalcedon, to which also they agreed.<sup><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
</sup>And they censured the consecration of Timothy, whom Leo, <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>
the bishop of Rome, even named &quot;the Antichrist.&quot; <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A><i>
</i>They say, indeed, that the other bishops also were influenced to write thus
by the instigation of Anatolius, and his letters to them.</p>
<p>But<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> Amphilochius of Side alone showed truth
and uprightness without fear. And he and the bishops of his province wrote
confidently, censuring and reviling the transactions of the Synod, and the
doctrine of the Tome, telling of the violence and partiality there displayed,
and confirming their statements by proofs and copious testimony from the Holy
Scriptures and the Fathers. He, moreover, besought the king that the
transactions of Chalcedon should be cancelled, since they were a cause of
stumbling to the believers, as well as of confusion. Nevertheless, he censured
the consecration of Timothy, and said that it had been done in an uncanonical
manner. This man, indeed, who testified thus confidently and truly to the king
respecting the Synod, fell into danger from the Nestorian party, in consequence
of the malignity and treachery which they exhibited towards him; for he was the
only one of all the bishops who had the courage to revile the Synod with its
transactions, and also the Tome. But Aspar, who was general at that time,
although he was an Arian, pleaded and begged for him that such a truthful priest
should not be exposed to danger. And thus, indeed, Amphilochius was delivered
from danger.</p>
<p>But<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> in his endeavour to correct the evils
which were done in the days of Marcian, the king was hindered by the bishops.
And by their means also Timothy was condemned to banishment in Gangra. Now that
Anatolius of Constantinople was the one to instigate the bishops to make these
statements to the king in the Encyclicals, you will learn from his letter to the
king which I have written below. <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VIII</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE EIGHTH CHAPTER, INDEED, TELLS ABOUT . THE LETTER OF ANATOLIUS TO THE
  KING ABOUT THE SYNOD, SAYING THAT HE HAD INFLUENCED THE BISHOPS BY WRITING <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Anatolius, bishop of Constantinople, to the believing and Christ-loving
king, victorious Augustus, Leo the emperor. It is a subject of prayer with me,
Christ-loving and believing king,&quot; etc. And a little further on he says:
&quot;Those audacious acts which have been committed In Alexandria, do not
suffer me to remain silent. But, as becomes one holding the priesthood of this
your royal city, being attached to the peaceable will of your Majesty, which
desires that the canons of the Fathers should not be despised, but that the laws
should be maintained, I have testified thus to the pious chief priest Leo and
the chaste Metropolitans of your dominion. And I weep for the canons which have
been despised by the wicked deeds of Timothy; since the records sent to your
Majesty respecting him declare that he has trampled upon the laws of the Church
and of the world; and that he has loved vainglory, according to the saying of
Scripture, that 'the wicked man is a despiser, even when he is falling into the
depth of evils.' &quot;<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></p>
<p>And the rest of his letter will be understood from this specimen; how he was
the cause of the letters sent by the bishops to the emperor, in which they
agreed to the transaction of the Synod. But many senators and citizens, having
learned this respecting Anatolius, withdrew from his communion. <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IX</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE NINTH CHAPTER TELLS ABOUT THE BANISHMENT OF TIMOTHY, AND THE EVENTS
  WHICH HAPPENED AT HIS DEPARTURE FROM ALEXANDRIA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, because the king's order respecting the departure of Timothy was sent to
Alexandria at this time, the general<sup> </sup>was consequently much
distressed, and felt himself constrained to suffer many things rather than that
the city should lose such a priest. However, since he saw the slaughter which
was threatened against him by the Proterian party, and especially as the members
of that party had taken refuge<sup> </sup>with the king, and were aided by all
the bishops; this same Stilas the general<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> thought
it well that he and the bishop should betake themselves for refuge to the
Baptistery of the great Church. And he did so for two reasons: one was, that
they themselves might be preserved from harm; and the other, that they might not
be the cause of the loss of life and of slaughter.</p>
<p>But when Timothy had taken refuge at the font of the Baptistery, the clergy
of the Proterian party paid no regard either to the priesthood, or to the
chastity, or to the age, or to the ascetic life, or to the labours of the man,
or indeed to the place where he had taken refuge; but with an armed force, they
snatched the chief priest from the very font, and dragged him away. And, as soon
as the report of this reached the people, they killed more than ten thousand
there to rescue the priest from them. However, after the Romans had slain many
of the Alexandrians, the man was taken; and he went out across Egypt to
Palestine, that his journey might be along the sea of Phoenice. <A NAME="p77"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|77</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when the cities and the inhabitants of Palestine and the seacoast <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
heard it, they came to him to be sanctified, and that the sick among them gain
healing for their diseases through the grace of God which was attached to his
person; and they snatched torn pieces of stuff from his garments, that they
might have them as charms to protect them from evil.</p>
<p>And when he arrived at Berytus, Eustace the bishop urged the citizens there
to receive him with public honour.</p>
<p>And he begged Timothy, upon his entry into the city, to pray for it; and the
latter stood in the midst of the city and made supplications and prayers to God
for it, and blessed it.</p>
<p>But Auxonius, the brother of Eustace, who was at that time an interpreter of
the law, acting upon the advice of his brother, spent the whole night with
Timothy, speaking earnestly about the faith, and against Nestorius. And during
the whole of his long discourse Timothy was a silent listener; but when at
length Auxonius, after many words, ceased speaking, Timothy said to him,
&quot;Who could persuade me that these three fingers should write upon the paper
of Chalcedon?&quot; And, upon hearing this, Auxonius was very sad, and began to
weep. Then Timothy, encouraging both him and his brother Eustace, who afterwards
joined them, said,</p>
<p>&quot;Attach yourselves to me, and let us contend together for the faith, and
let us prevail; so that either we shall recover our bishoprics, or else we shall
be driven into banishment by our enemies, and live a sincere life with
God.&quot; And he alleged as an excuse the dedication of a church, a great
temple which Eustace built and named &quot;Anastasia&quot;; and Timothy said,
&quot;Shall we wait for the dedication of an earthly temple? But if you obey me,
then we shall hold our festival in the heavenly Jerusalem?&quot;</p>
<p>And Timothy received the same kind of honour along the way, until he reached
Gangra. <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>THE TENTH CHAPTER EXPLAINS ABOUT ANOTHER TIMOTHY, WHO WAS THE BISHOP OF THE
  PROTERIAN PARTY, AND WAS CALLED SALOPHACIOLUS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> the members of the Proterian party,
because of the order of the king and the governors of the cities who were
obedient to the command, elected one of themselves, also called Timothy
Salophaciolus, and placed him upon the episcopal throne. He was a man who sought
popularity;<sup> </sup>and was soft in his manners and feeble in his actions; as
events, indeed, proved.</p>
<p>For when all the people of the city forsook the church, and assembled, along
with the believing clergy, in the monasteries, he was neither enraged nor
distressed. But when his own clergy were anxious to restrain the people by means
of the Roman armed force, he would not allow them.</p>
<p>Now it happened that a certain woman met him carrying her child, who had just
been baptized by the believers, and was being borne along in triumph according
to the usual custom. And his attendants were very indignant at it. But he
ordered them to bring her to him quietly; and he took up the child and kissed
him, and he urged the mother to take whatever she wanted. And he said to his own
followers,</p>
<p>&quot;Let us and these Christians, each as he thinks right, believe and
honour our Lord.&quot; Nevertheless, though he did all this, he could not
appease the rage of the citizens; and because he dreaded the fate of Proterius,
he would not walk abroad without the Romans. And just in proportion as the
people loved Timothy the believer, so they hated this man. And they never ceased
imploring and entreating the king that Timothy should be restored to them from
banishment. <A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they say of this Salophaciolus that he tried hard to persuade the
Alexandrians to hold communion with him; and, as if rejecting the Synod, he
wrote in the Diptych the name of Dioscorus. And when Leo of Rome heard it, he
excommunicated him.</p>
<p>And on one occasion, when he went up to Constantinople, he had a great
dispute with Gennadius, the successor of Anatolius, in the king's presence. And
he said, &quot;I do not accept the Synod which would make your see the next in
importance to Rome, and cast contempt upon the honour of my see.&quot; And the
king laughed when he saw them, and heard the two priests contending for the
pre-eminence.</p>
<p>And he wrote to tell about this dispute to the bishop of Rome; who at that
time replied in writing, that the privileges of each see should be restored
according to their original constitution. And he made this known to the king.</p>
<p>So much about this Timothy Salophaciolus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER TELLS HOW TIMOTHY WAS DRIVEN FROM GANGRA TO CHERSON,
  IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE HATRED WHICH THE PARTY OF CHALCEDON ENTERTAINED AGAINST
  HIM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Gennadius of Constantinople and his adherents did not desist from their
persecution of Timothy, even when he was in banishment. For they persuaded the
king to command his removal from Gangra to Cherson, which is a region inhabited
by barbarous and uncivilised men.</p>
<p>But the bishop of Gangra heartily consented to this, on account of the envy
which he felt towards the believing, virtuous, and miracle-working Timothy, the
friend of the poor; because he used to receive gifts from the believers of
Alexandria and Egypt and other places, and to make liberal distribution for the
relief of the needy.</p>
<p>And having embarked on board ship, and launched upon <A NAME="p80"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|80</SPAN></A>
the sea, though he was tossed in the midst of the winter, yet he reached Cherson
without danger. And when the inhabitants of the country learned the reason, they
were filled with admiration for him; and they became followers of his faith, and
submitted themselves to his authority.</p>
<p>But the hatred which the Nestorian party entertained against him was caused
by his diligence in continually writing reproaches and censures upon the Synod
and the Tome, and sending them forth on all sides; thereby encouraging the
believers. And he corroborated his words from the Holy Scriptures, and the
doctors of the Church, from the time of Christ's preaching even to his own day.</p>
<p>In consequence of these writings, those persons who understood the matter
left Gennadius of Constantinople and joined in communion with Acacius the
presbyter and Master of the Orphans, the brother of Timocletus the composer, who
joined the believers, and strenuously opposed the Nestorians; and he also set
verses to music, and they used to sing them. And the people were delighted with
them, and they flocked in crowds to the Orphan Hospital.</p>
<p>But the king ordered that the blessed Mary should be proclaimed and written
in the book of life as <i>Theotokos, </i>on account of Martyrius of Antioch, who
was an avowed Nestorian, and would not now consent to teach these things, who
also was deposed.</p>
<p>But Gregory of Nyssa (a believing and virtuous man, the namesake of the
learned Gregory) was summoned by the king to put an end to the doctrine of the
Nestorians at that time; as some monks went on a mission to the king about the
matter of Martyrius. And Gennadius<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> had died; and
Acacius, the Master of the Orphan Hospital, was appointed as his successor.</p>
<p>And a promise had been made by the latter that he would put an end to the
Tome of Leo, and the Synod of Chalcedon, <A NAME="p81"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|81</SPAN></A>
and the innovations and additions which had been imposed upon the faith in it.</p>

  <p>THE TWELFTH CHAPTER TELLS ABOUT THE EUTYCHIANISTS, ISAIAH, BISHOP OF
  HERMOPOLIS, AND THEOPHILUS, A PRESBYTER OF ALEXANDRIA; AND ABOUT THE LETTER
  WRITTEN BY TIMOTHY RESPECTING THEM, IN WHICH HE EXPOSED THEIR ERRORS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The affairs of the Church of the royal city, indeed, were in the condition
described above.</p>
<p>But Timothy, when in banishment, wrote not alone against the Nestorians, but
also against the Eutychianists. And this appears from his letters to Alexandria
and Palestine, against those who hold the opinions of Eutyches, and do not
confess Christ to be of the same nature with us in the flesh as well as of the
same Nature with the Father in the Godhead.</p>
<p>And it so happened that the Eutychianists, Isaiah, bishop of Hermopolis, and
Theophilus, a presbyter of Alexandria, were sojourning in the royal city with
the desire of making money. And they circulated a report that Timothy also was
of their way of thinking. And when he heard this he wrote a letter dealing with
the doctrines of Eutyches and Nestorius, which he sent to Constantinople signed
with his own signature. And when<i> </i>the bearers of this letter became known,
they were treated by these men with contempt; and were exposed to danger,
because he called the followers of Isaiah &quot;deceivers.&quot; Whereupon he
sent again another letter respecting them, confirming it by quotations from the
fathers. And it was to the following effect:—</p>
<p align="center">THE LETTER OF TIMOTHY</p>
<p>&quot;Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, in order that He might redeem us and
set us free from the dominion of Satan, and <A NAME="p82"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|82</SPAN></A>
make us meet for the blessings of Heaven, appointed for us, through the holy
fathers, the law of those things which are pleasing to Himself. And He gave
commandment that no man, thinking to honour, should insult the Merciful One; but
that He should receive the dispensation for our redemption. And He said, 'Turn
not aside to the right hand or to the left, but walk in the way of the kingdom.'
<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> And again He said, 'Be not righteous overmuch,
nor count thyself too wise, lest thou fall into error. And do not fall deeply
into error, nor be stubborn, lest thou die before the time';<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
the meaning of which is, lest the evil one should infuse into thee anything
contrary to My commandments, and set a stumbling-block for thee on the way of
the kingdom along which thou art walking, and slay thee. For he said, 'In the
way wherein I walked they laid snares for me.' <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
Take heed, therefore, to thyself, and do not turn aside nor depart from the way
of the kingdom. For this is the desire of the evil one, who, if thou shalt fill
up much wickedness, will meet thee, and thou wilt fall into danger.</p>
<p>&quot;For, suppose a man seeking to enter a city surrounded by water; if he
attempt to pass through on foot he will sink and be drowned in its depth; if, on
the other hand, he be afraid to pass over, he cannot enter the city at all; but
if there be a convenient ford, and he try to cross over by it, then he can enter
the city. In like manner also we being anxious to enter Jerusalem, which is
above, if we do not follow the Law of God, which we have learned from the holy
doctors, cannot indeed stand upon the rock of our leader Peter Kepho, the true
faith. 'For thou shalt indeed be called Kepho, and upon this rock I will build
My Church; and the bars of Sheol shall not prevail against it.'<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
Let no man be so led astray by the evil one as to imagine that he can subvert
the true faith; and if he is contending, it is against his own soul <A NAME="p83"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|83</SPAN></A>
that he contends; but nothing can overcome the faith. And this is the meaning of
the expression, 'The bars of Sheol shall not prevail against it.' Wherefore, if
any man stand not upon the truth of the faith, but is righteous overmuch, when
he thinks to confer honour, he rather offers insult; but if he accept the Law of
the Lord, which has been laid down for us by the saints, he survives visions of
death and the verge of Sheol. For we have learned that apart from the standard
of the faith, we cannot please God.</p>
<p>&quot;These things I have written, because I have heard that some persons are
contentious, and are not obedient unto the Law of the Lord which has been laid
down for us by the saints; and which declares that our Lord, by His incarnation,
was of the same nature with us in the flesh which He took from us, which
doctrine they have even rejected if they are not of this mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Accordingly, let no one, thinking to honour God, insult His mercy by
refusing to obey the doctrine of the holy fathers, who have declared that our
Lord Jesus Christ is of the same nature with us in the flesh, and is one with
His flesh. For I have heard also the holy apostle teaching and saying,
'Forasmuch as the children were partakers of the flesh and the blood, He also
(partook of the same) in like manner; that by means of death He might destroy
the power of death, who is Satan; and might deliver all who were held in the
fear of death, and were subject to bondage, that so they might live for ever.
For He did not take (the nature) from angels, but He took it from the seed of
Abraham. And it was fitting that He should be made in all points like unto His
brethren, and that He should be a merciful priest, and faithful with God; and
that He should make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He
suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted.' <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
For this expression, 'He was made like us in all points,' teaches all who desire
to be meet for the blessings of heaven and to be redeemed, that they must
confess the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ as being from Mary the <A NAME="p84"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|84</SPAN></A>
holy Virgin and <i>Theotokos</i>; Christ Who was of the same nature with her and
with us in the flesh, and is of the same Nature with the Father in His Godhead.</p>
<p>&quot;For the fathers anathematised, and we also agreeing with them
anathematise in like manner, any who do not hold their doctrines.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have, moreover, in our letter added some quotations from them,
attesting the truth of this doctrine :—</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF ATHANASIUS <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'For this, indeed, the apostle writes expressly, that, &quot;other
foundation can no man lay (than that which is laid),<sup> </sup>even Christ; but
let every man take heed how he builds.&quot;<sup><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
</sup>Now it is necessary that a foundation such as this should be in conformity
and likeness with those who are built upon it. God the Word, because He is the
Word and the only-begotten one, has no peers who could be the sons of the
Godhead in the same manner as He. But inasmuch as He became man, of our nature,
and clothed Himself with our body, we are of the same nature with Him.
Accordingly, in the matter of our humanity He is the foundation; so that we may
be precious stones, and be built upon Him, and be a temple for the indwelling of
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>&quot; 'For, in like manner as He is the foundation and we are the stones
built upon Him, so also He is the vine and we are the branches, hanging from Him
and in Him; not indeed in the nature of the Godhead, for that would not be
possible, but in the manhood. Now it is fitting that the branches should be like
the vine, because we also are like Him in that body which He took from us.</p>
<p>&quot; 'And <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> we confess that He is the Son of
God, and God in the Spirit, and man in the flesh. And there are not two natures
in one Son, one to be worshipped and the other <A NAME="p85"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|85</SPAN></A>
unworthy of worship; but there is one Nature of God the Word, Who became
incarnate, and Who, along with the flesh in which He is clothed, is to be
worshipped with one worship.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME, IN HIS LETTER TO EPICTETUS <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'Now there are many, hiding themselves and blushing, who imagine that,
if we affirm the body of our Lord to be from Mary, we introduce a fourth Person
into the Trinity; but if we affirm the body to be of the same Nature with the
Word, the Trinity thereby remains without the addition of any foreign element.
While if we maintain with respect to His body that it is human; then since the
body is foreign to the Nature of God, when the Word is in it, there must of
necessity be a Quaternity instead of a Trinity, in consequence of the addition
of the body.</p>
<p>&quot; 'When they talk in this way they do not consider how their own
argument breaks down and fails. For even if they deny the body to be from Mary,
they, no less than those who hold a distinct body,<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
also seem to hold a Quaternity. For in like manner as the Son is of the same
Nature with the Father, and is not the Father but the Son in Person, yet being
of the same Nature with the Father; so also, if the body is of the same Nature
with the Word, it is not the Word, and since there is another, the Trinity, even
according to their showing, is found to be a Quaternity.</p>
<p>&quot; 'But the true, indivisible and perfect Trinity can never receive any
addition. What then must be the mind of these persons, and how can they be
Christians who hold that there is another besides Him who is God? '</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME, FROM THE SAME LETTER <A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'The body of our Redeemer, derived from Mary, was in reality and truth
human in nature, because it was like our body; <A NAME="p86"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|86</SPAN></A>
since Mary is our sister, we being all descended from our father Adam.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF JULIUS OF ROME <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;' And there is no change whatsoever in the Divine Nature, for It is not
subject to diminution or increase. And when He says, &quot;Glorify Me,&quot;
that is the voice of the body, and is spoken concerning the body. For glory was
affirmed with respect to His whole Being, for He is all one. And by this the
&quot;glory which I had with Thee before the world was,&quot; <sup><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
</sup>He testified concerning His Godhead that It is always glorified, for such
glory properly belongs to It, even though this affirmation was made equally
concerning His whole Being. So in the Spirit He is of the same Nature with the
Father invisibly; and since the body also was united to Him in His Nature, it is
equally included under the name. And again, also, His Godhead is comprehended
under the name because It is united to our nature, and the nature of the body is
not converted into the nature of God by the union, and conjunction of the name
of the nature. Just as the nature of the Godhead was not changed by the
conjunction of the human body, and by the appellation of a body of our nature.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot; OF THE SAME, FROM HIS LETTER TO DIONYSIUS <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'They indeed, who confess that the God of heaven became incarnate from
the Virgin, and that He being joined to His flesh was one, give themselves
needless trouble in contending with the maintainers of the opposite view, who
affirm (as I have heard) that there are two natures. Since John proved our Lord
to be one by saying, &quot;The Word became flesh.&quot;<sup>4</sup> And Paul by
saying, &quot;There is one Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things.&quot;
<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> Now, if He Who was born from the Virgin was
named Jesus, and He it is through Whom were ail things; He is one nature because
He <A NAME="p87"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|87</SPAN></A> is one Person, Who is not divided
into two. For the nature of the body was not separate, nor yet did the Nature of
the Godhead remain distinct at the Incarnation; but just as man, composed of
body and soul, is one nature, so also He, Who is in the likeness of men, is one
Jesus Christ.'</p>

with Himself. And although the doors were shut He entered, that He might display
the power of His Godhead and the reality of His body.<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>

that the Son of God is One, and he who is man from Mary is another, who became a
son by grace as we; so that there would be <i>Two </i>dwelling in the Deity;<i> </i>One,
of the same Nature with God, and the other who became so by grace, the man from
Mary : and whosoever, further, says that the body of our Lord was from above,
and not from the Virgin Mary; or that the Godhead was converted into flesh; or
that It was confounded or changed; or that the Godhead of our Lord suffered; or
that the body of Christ, inasmuch as it is from men, should not be worshipped,
and not that the body is to be worshipped because it is that of our Lord and
God;—the man who asserts these things we anathematise, for we obey the apostle
when he says,</p>
<p>&quot;Whosoever preaches to you a gospel different from that which we have
preached to you, let him be accursed.&quot; '<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A></p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF BISHOP AMBROSE</p>
<p>&quot; 'He is the same Person Who speaks, though not always in the same
manner. But He had regard in it at one time to the glory of God, and at another
time to the passions of men. As God, He teaches divine things, because He is the
Word; and as man, He teaches human things, because He speaks in our nature.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THEOPHILUS OF ALEXANDRIA <A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'The Word, the living God, the Lord of all, and Creator of the worlds,
did not clothe Himself in a heavenly <A NAME="p93"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|93</SPAN></A>
body as in some costly substance and come to us, but He displayed in clay the
greatness of the skill of His art. For, when He would restore and renew man who
was formed from the clay, He was born as man from the Virgin, who, corresponding
to us in all points, sin only excepted, and coming into being by a miracle,
shone upon us and blessed our human nature.</p>
<p>&quot; 'However, the first man also came into being in a manner different and
distinct from us, as the intercourse and association of man and woman did not
minister to his creation. And if they allow, in his case, that he was formed out
of the earth by the will of God, no parents having ministered to his birth by
the conjunction of male and female; why do they quarrel with the Incarnation of
our Lord and Saviour, which was from the Virgin? And when they oppose us in this
matter, we ask them whether is it easier that a man should come into being from
the earth without parents, or that our Saviour Christ should be born from the
Virgin, with flesh, and soul, and consciousness? And the first man, indeed, who
was from the earth, partook of flesh and blood in all the likeness of humanity;
but our Saviour, by His own power, created and prepared from the Virgin a body
for Himself with flesh, and blood, and soul, and consciousness. And we confess
that He consorted with men, even though in His holy Incarnation the sensual
intercourse of man and woman had no part.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'Now it was not difficult for God the Word to prepare for Himself a
temple from the Virgin's body, for the purpose of our redemption. For consider,
indeed, that God also is never polluted by natural copulation when He creates
man; and how much more then, by His mercy, may He become <A NAME="p94"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|94</SPAN></A>
incarnate from the blood of the Virgin, for the purpose of our redemption.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF CYRIL</p>
<p>&quot; 'So, truly, the <i>Theotokos </i>still remained a virgin after giving
birth to Christ by a miracle; and He was partaker, in like manner as we, of
flesh and blood, not of His own nature, as the heretics say, but of our nature,
according to the saying, &quot;He took the seed of Abraham.&quot; ' <A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A></p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME <A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'We assert that the body of the Word was His own, and not that of some
other man separately and distinctly who is held to be different from Christ the
Son. And as the body of each one of us is said to be his own, so also we believe
respecting the one Christ. And although He took the body from our race and our
nature, because He was born of the Virgin; yet it must be held and declared to
be His own body. And, since God the Word is the Life in His own Nature, He
declared His body to be a life-giving one. And therefore He became to us a
blessing, giving life to all.<sup>3</sup> And if it be not so, how then is He
like us, while yet remaining as He was before, God the Word? However, grant to
Him that in the unity of the Person His body is not separated, and do not denude
Him of His flesh. And thus I rightly worship one Son, Who is of the same Nature
indeed with the Father in the Godhead, but of the same nature with us in the
manhood. And as for those who delight to believe this truth, Christ will
enlighten their knowledge also of Himself by His mysteries.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME</p>
<p>&quot; 'It is right, indeed, for us to say and believe that God the Word,
still remaining of the same Nature with God the Father, was sent and became man,
of the same nature with us. <A NAME="p95"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|95</SPAN></A> He is
and He remains as He is, and by becoming man He was not changed. And He was sent
to preach deliverance to the captives and light to the blind.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME, FROM HIS LETTER TO SUCCENSUS <A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot; 'They say, if Christ be perfect God and perfect man, and the same is
of the Nature of the Father in the Godhead and of our nature in the manhood, how
is He perfect if His human nature is not seen? and how is He of our nature if
that actual and self-same nature which is ours be not seen? The answer which we
have given at the beginning should suffice to enlighten them. For if, when
speaking of one nature of the Word, we refrained from saying
&quot;incarnate,&quot; rejecting the dispensation, their word would be plausible
when they ask, &quot;How can He be perfect in manhood and in Nature?&quot; But
since our word indeed testifies that He is perfect in manhood and in Nature by
saying that He became flesh, therefore let them cease from these objections, and
not lean upon a broken reed.'</p>
<p align="center">&quot;OF THE SAME</p>
<p>&quot; 'In the might, indeed, of His Godhead He took the hand of the daughter
of Jairus, saying, &quot;Maid, arise.&quot; <A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A> And
He did not give the command in word merely, and the work was accomplished
according to His own will. But<A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A> that we might
believe that His holy body was of the same nature with our bodies, while it also
was glorious, and divine, and raised above our measure, it being also His own,
He wrought in it. For which reason, also, He called His own body the &quot;Bread
of Life.&quot;' <A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;And so these fathers and holy men like them have with <A NAME="p96"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|96</SPAN></A>
one consent anathematised every man who is not obedient to their doctrine.</p>
<p>&quot;And I have written to Alexandria, to the clergy, to the monks, to the
sisters the virgins in Christ, and to the believing people; and I have sent the
letter to you, my dear friends; and that ye may know what I have written, I,
Timothy, have marked the salutation with my own handwriting.</p>
<p>&quot;Whosoever does not believe in the doctrine of the holy fathers, in
accordance with the tradition of our Lord Jesus Christ: let him be accursed. For
it is right for each one of us either to stand fast in the faith and to live in
it, or else to die on behalf of it, and to live for evermore.</p>
<p>&quot;My brother Anatolius the presbyter, and Theophilus, and Cyrus, and
Christodorus, and Gennadius the deacons, and the members of the brotherhood who
are with me, send you their greeting.&quot;</p>
<p>The foregoing letter, with the quotations appended thereto, we have written
down here. By reading and considering it, lovers of the doctrine will find in it
a sufficient refutation of the notion of Nestorius, who holds that there are two
Natures in the unity of Christ; and also of the teaching of Eutyches, who does
not confess that God the Word became perfect Man, and remained without change
God the Word, One Person who became flesh.</p>
<p>And, besides this letter, we have subjoined another explaining the right
method of reception in the case of those who repent and turn from heresy.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>THE LETTER OF TIMOTHY WHICH HE WROTE TO ALEXANDRIA, AND BY WHICH HE CUT
    OFF ISAIAH AND THEOPHILUS FROM COMMUNION WITH THE BELIEVERS</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Timothy to the God-loving bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, and
archimandrites, and sisters, and faithful people in the Lord, greeting—</p>
<p>&quot;Inasmuch as Isaiah and Theophilus have been for a long time heretics in
secret, whom I admonished by letter, urging <A NAME="p97"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|97</SPAN></A>
them to agree to the holy doctrine of the fathers, and they have not been
obedient to the letters which I wrote to them to Constantinople, containing
proofs from Scripture, and the doctors of the Church, that our Lord Jesus Christ
was of the same nature with us in the body; and furthermore they have shown no
respect for my sufferings in being banished from place to place, but have
behaved treacherously towards the bearers of my letter, and also informed the
prefects against them, and they stirred up others, saying, 'It is a forgery,'
even though they knew my signature which was on the letter. And I waited a
considerable time for them though I knew their disposition, and they made no
reply, either by word of mouth or in writing. And upon reflection, I thought it
right to send them another letter; so I wrote urging them to come and confess
the true faith. And in my admonition I reminded them that God does not condemn
nor reject those who repent. And I cited the examples of holy men who sinned and
denied the Lord, but who afterwards repented; and God accepted their repentance,
and accounted them worthy of their former dignity; such was the case of David,
and Peter, and Paul.</p>
<p>&quot;And I wrote to them that in like manner, if they would repent and
confess the body of Christ to be of the same nature as ours, I would continue to
entertain my old esteem and love for them; and I would maintain them in the
honour of their rank. And they showed no affection for me, but treated me with
contempt.</p>
<p>&quot;And after this I waited four years more for them, without exposing them
by name. And they still persevered in their disobedience, and showed no sign of
repentance, and they neither received the doctrine of the holy fathers nor me.
And they associated with some heretics who openly deny that our Lord took a
human body, and that He became perfect man from us. And they creep into houses,
and greedily grasp at gain, which they hold as their god, while they are
sojourning in the royal city. And I wrote to them that they should <A NAME="p98"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|98</SPAN></A>
depart from it, but they would not. And they continued to lead simple folk
astray, and to circulate other rumours respecting me, with the object of doing
me great harm. And being distressed and saddened by them, I was compelled to
excommunicate them by their names lest they should cause many to stumble and
err.</p>
<p>&quot;And I now give sentence upon Isaiah and Theophilus, who say that the
body of the Lord is of His own divine Nature, and not of ours, and who deny His
true humanity, thereby cutting themselves off from the fellowship of the holy
fathers and mine; that no man henceforth hold communion with them. For John the
evangelist commands, saying, 'My brethren, believe not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they be of God; for indeed, many false prophets have appeared in
the world. And hereby the spirit which is from God is known, every spirit which
confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit
which does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the
false Christ. Because many deceivers have gone forth into the world, who do not
confess Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh; this is a deceiver and a false
Christ.'<A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> And again, 'If any man comes to you not
preaching this doctrine, do not either receive him into the house or greet him,
for he that greets him is partaker with his evil deeds.' <A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
And because of the apostle who says, 'Whosoever preaches to you a gospel
different from what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.'<A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;I am clear from their blood and from that of their associates; for I
have not ceased to show them, according to the will of God, what is for their
good. For Paul further exhorts us, saying, 'After thou hast warned an heretic
once or twice, and he has refused thine admonition, avoid him; since by
continuing in his sin he is corrupted and guilty.'<sup><A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
</sup>But the blessed Dioscorus the Confessor wrote sentiments agreeable to
these of the holy fathers, and after the same manner, in his letter to
Secundinus.&quot; . . . And the letter goes on to say, &quot;Now, I beseech you,
brethren, by the <A NAME="p99"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|99</SPAN></A> Lord Jesus Christ,
and by the love of the Spirit, concerning those who repent and turn from the
heresy of the <i>Diphysites, </i>as I wrote in a letter a year ago, that you,
the bishops, and clergy, and other believers, all who are subject to you, help
them, and extend the hand to them in the Lord.</p>
<p>&quot;And when anyone is converted let him have one year of repentance, and
after that let him be established in his former rank, and his dignity be
restored to him. And if there be no believing bishop, let the clergy or the
believing bishops, who from any cause happen to be in the country, fill the
place in the love of God, even though those who repent are not subject to them
in jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&quot;This same order and regulation Cyril and Dioscorus observed of one
year's repentance for bishops, presbyters, and deacons; after which they should
be established in their former rank.</p>
<p>&quot;Pray for me that God may help me in this conflict; the Lord be with
you. Amen!&quot;</p>
<p>Such letters he wrote advising them how they should receive converts from the
Proterian party.</p>
<p>And he became so celebrated, even with the people of India, that when their
bishop died they, being of the same faith with him, sent a request to him that
he would appoint a bishop for them.</p>
<p>But, indeed, the Alexandrians never ceased sending petitions and
supplications to the king on his behalf, time after time, and stirring up
popular tumult for him. For as soon as they heard of the death of Leo and the
succession of Basiliscus, they sent a deputation of certain chosen monks, Paul
the Sophist, and James, and Theopompus.</p>
<p>But the chief priests who held office from the Council of Chalcedon until the
time of Basiliscus, and the encyclical <A NAME="p100"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|100</SPAN></A>
letters which he and Marcus, wrote, and up to the reign of Zeno, who became
emperor, are as follows:—</p>
<p>Of Rome, Leo, and his successor Hilary.</p>
<p>Of Alexandria, Proterius, who was killed. And his successor was Timothy the
Great, who was banished. And until he returned by means of the <i>Encyclicals, </i>they
appointed another Timothy, called Salophaciolus.</p>
<p>In Constantinople, Anatolius, and his successor Gennadius, who was succeeded
by Acacius.</p>
<p>In Ephesus, John, who took the place of Bassian; and Paul, who was banished,
and who returned by means of the <i>Encyclicals, </i>but was banished again.</p>
<p>In Antioch, Domnus, and his successor was Maximus, and then Martyrius, who
was driven out; and after him Julian, who was succeeded by Stephen; and then
another Stephen, who was driven out; and Peter, who returned from banishment two
or three times.</p>
<p>And in Jerusalem, Juvenalis, and Anastasius his successor.</p>
<p>Now King Leo the emperor died, and there arose after him Basiliscus, and
Marcus, and Zeno, who had retired for a little time to the strongholds of
Salmon; but he afterwards returned and became emperor, and Basiliscus and Marcus
were driven out.</p>
