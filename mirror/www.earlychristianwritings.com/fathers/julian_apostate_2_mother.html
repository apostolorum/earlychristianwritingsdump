<p>MUST we then speak of this subject also: and shall we write concerning things
that are not to be told, and shall we publish things not to be divulged, and
secrets not to be spoken aloud? Who indeed is <i>Attis </i>or <i>Gallos</i>;<i> </i>who
the <i>Mother of the Gods</i>; what is the reason of this rule of <i>Chastity</i>;
moreover for what cause has such an institution been established among us from
remote antiquity; handed down to us indeed from the most ancient of the
Phrygians, but accepted in the first place by the Greeks ---- and those not the
vulgar herd, but the Athenians ---- taught by the event that they had not done
well in ridiculing him that was performing the rites of the Great Mother. For
they are said to have insulted and driven off the Gallos, as one who was making
innovations in religion: because they did not understand the character of the
goddess, or how that she was the very &quot;Deo,&quot; &quot;Rhea,&quot; and
&quot;Demeter&quot; so much honoured amongst them themselves.</p>
<p>Then followed vengeance on the part of the goddess, and then a remedy for
that vengeance. For she that was directress unto the Greeks in all good things
(namely, the prophetess of the Delphic god) ordered them to propitiate the anger
of the Great Mother; and hence was <A NAME="p255"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|255</SPAN></A>
erected by the Athenians the Temple &quot;of the Mother,&quot; wherein were kept
all the public documents. After the Greeks, the Romans also received her; the
Pythia having advised them, in their turn, to bring the goddess out of Phrygia
for their helper in the war against the Carthaginians. And here there is nothing
to prevent me from relating a little history. These most religious inhabitants
of Rome, on the receipt of the oracle, send off an embassy to beg of the kings
of Pergamus, who at that time were masters of Phrygia, and from the Phrygians
themselves, the most holy statue of the goddess. They received and carried away
the sacred burthen, having embarked it in a large merchant-ship, competent to
traverse such mighty seas. Having crossed the Aegean and Ionian Seas, and sailed
round the Sicilian and the Tyrrhene, she finally entered the mouth of the Tiber.
The people streamed out of the city, together with the Senate: before them all,
however, advanced to receive her the priests and priestesses, arrayed after the
manner of the country, with their attention fixed upon the vessel which was
coming in under full sail. They gazed at the surging of the waves as they
divided themselves around the keel; and as she sailed up they welcomed her, each
one kissing his hand to her, as they happened to be standing in front, from a
distance. But the ship, as though desirous to prove to the people of Rome that
it was not a mere lifeless <i>wooden </i>image <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> she
was bringing them from Phrygia, but that, whatever it was she was bringing them
from the Phrygians, it must possess some greater and supernatural virtue of its
own, as soon as the goddess touched the Tiber she made the ship stand still, as
though it had suddenly taken root in the bed of the river. They towed her
against the stream----she did not follow: they waded into the shallows, and
endeavoured to shove off the ship---- <A NAME="p256"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|256</SPAN></A>
she did not yield for all their pushing: next every possible resource was
tried----she none the less remained immovable. For this cause a dire and unjust
suspicion was cast upon the virtue of the Virgin who was invested with the
highest sacerdotal rank, and they accused Clodia (such was the name of the
reverend Vestal) of not keeping herself entirely unpolluted and pure in honour
of the goddess, and therefore the latter was perhaps incensed, and took her
vengeance: for all thought the event to be something supernatural. The Vestal,
at first, was filled with shame at the rumour, and at the suspicion; so far
removed was she from the forbidden and disgraceful fact: but when she perceived
the slander against herself was spreading, and every moment gaining strength,
she took off her girdle, and fastening it about the figure-head of the ship, as
if by a sudden inspiration she ordered the crowd to fall back, and besought the
goddess not to suffer her to be without cause exposed to such accusations. Then
shouting, they say, like the sailors' cry: &quot;Mistress and Mother,&quot; she
exclaimed, &quot;if I <i>am </i>chaste, follow me:&quot; and forthwith she not
merely stirred the ship, but towed it after her for a considerable distance
against the current. And hereby the goddess, I ween, showed unto the Romans that
the freight they were bringing from Phrygia was one worth no small price, but
rather worth all they had to give: not a thing human, but a thing divine: not
mere soulless earth, but something possessed of life, and out of nature. Such a
manifestation, therefore, of her power did the goddess make before our people:
she proved also another thing, that neither the virtue nor the vice of a single
one of the citizens could escape her scrutiny. The war immediately prospered
with the Romans against the Carthaginians, in such sort that their third war was
merely for the <i>walls </i>of Carthage.</p>
<p>If this tale of the Vestal shall be thought by some incredible, and not
suitable for either a philosopher or a theologian, let it none the less be
recounted, for it is <A NAME="p257"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|257</SPAN></A> publicly
recorded by very many historians, and its memory preserved in brazen statues in
that most noble and religious <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> city, Rome. I am not
indeed ignorant that certain over-wise people will call these legends &quot;old
wives' fables,&quot; and not worth listening to; but I think, for my part, that
in such matters it is better to believe the testimony of nations than of those
witty individuals, whose little soul is acute indeed, but has a clear insight
into no one thing. As regards the theory that came into my mind lately, during
the actual period wherein <i>continence </i>is enjoined, I am informed that
Porphyry, too, has composed a philosophical treatise upon this very subject; but
as I have not met with his book, I cannot tell whether he happens to agree in
any way with my own explanation. For my part, by my unassisted judgment I
understand by this &quot;Gallos,&quot; or &quot;Attis,&quot; the existence of
the <i>Generative </i>and <i>Formative Intelligence, </i>which generates all
things down to the very furthest limits of Matter, and which contains in itself
all the reasons and causes of <i>material species. </i>For the species of all
are not contained in all; nor are those of the farthest off and the <i>last </i>of
all, beyond which no more exists, contained in the Causes that be highest
(final) and <i>first, </i>or where the name of &quot;Deprivation &quot; is
applied with the sense of &quot;Absence of Form.&quot; <i>Now </i>since there
are many Existences, and very many Creators, the nature of that Creator who
possesses the remote reasons, and the continuous efficient causes of material
species, the nature, that is to say, of the superabundance of generative
faculty,<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> which is the lowest placed, and which
extends as far as our earth from the stars above---- <A NAME="p258"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|258</SPAN></A>
<i>this </i>Nature is the <i>Attis </i>we are seeking for. It is, however,
necessary to make a clearer definition of what I am advancing. I lay it down
that there is <i>Matter, </i>and also there are <i>Material Species, </i>but
unless a <i>Final Cause </i>for them be previously assumed, we shall be, without
perceiving it, introducing the doctrine of Epicurus: since if nothing be
anterior to two efficient causes, a spontaneous <i>flux </i>and <i>chance </i>must
have united the two together. But we see (remarks some quick-witted
Peripatetician, like Xenagoras) that the cause of these things is the
&quot;Fifth <sup><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> </sup>and Revolving Body:&quot;
Aristotle, also, has made himself ridiculous by his inquiry and idle curiosity
in this subject, and Theophrastus has followed his example, for he did not
understand his own language. For after he had got as far as the Incorporeal and
Intelligible existence he stopped short, not <i>investigating </i>that
existence, but <i>defining </i>in what <i>way </i>these things came to exist;
whereas he ought, I fancy, to have <i>assumed </i>their coming into existence in
the same way as he did in the case of the &quot;Fifth Body,&quot; and not sought
after the causes, and to have stopped at this point, without flying off into the
Ideal----a thing which has no natural existence of itself, but rests upon bare
mental conception. To this effect I remember having heard Xenarchus lecture, but
whether he was correct or not in so speaking must be left to the most high
flying <A NAME="p259"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|259</SPAN></A> Peripateticians to
discover, but that he (Aristotle) does not speak in every way to <i>my </i>satisfaction
is quite clear, inasmuch as I do not accept even the hypotheses of Aristotle
unless they be brought into conformity with the doctrine of Plato; and, still
more, the present subject must be reconciled with the revelations given to us
from the mouth of the gods. One question, however, is worth asking; In what way
can the Revolving Body contain the incorporeal causes of the immaterial species?
for that without these Causes it is not possible that generation can subsist is,
I suppose, self-evident and certain. To what purpose, pray, exist all these
things that be born? Whence come male and female? Whence the difference in kind
of all things that be, amongst visible species, unless there be certain
pre-existing and previously established <i>Reasons </i>and <i>Causes </i>subsisting
beforehand, in the nature of a <i>pattern? </i>With regard to which, though we
are dull of sight, yet let us strive to clear away the mist from the eyes of the
soul. The proper mode of clearing them is to turn into oneself, and to
contemplate how the soul, and the mind imprisoned in <i>Matter, </i>are, as it
were, the impression in wax and the image of things <i>Immaterial. </i>For this
one thing <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> is not of the number of bodies, nor of
the things that exist and are contemplated, incorporeally in connection with our
bodies, the conception of which the soul is unable to receive independently of
the body: a thing that it (the soul) would never have done, did it not possess
in its nature some certain relationship with things incorporeal. This is
Aristotle's meaning when he called the soul the &quot;Type of species, though
not in <i>activity, </i>yet in <i>potentiality&quot; </i>That a soul thus
constituted, and one turned inwards upon the body, contains these qualities in
potentiality, is a necessary consequence; and if this soul be unconfined and
without mixture, as it were, it cannot upset the argument, but must be supposed
in all respects to be in <i>activity.</i> <A NAME="p260"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|260</SPAN></A>
Let us consider the point more intelligibly, through the medium of an example
which, Plato has used in his &quot;Sophist,&quot; although applied there to a
different subject. The example I do not intend adducing for a proof of my
argument, for it ought not to be taken as a <i>proof, </i>but only as an <i>illustration;
</i>since it is about the First Causes, or those at least which are of the same
rank with the First, that is, if our Attis be (as there is good reason to think)
of divine nature. But what, and what sort of thing is your example? Plato
remarks somewhere in his discussion upon &quot;Imitation,&quot; that &quot;if
one should try to imitate in such a way as to <i>reproduce </i>the thing
imitated, the task is full of labour and difficult----nay, of a truth almost an
aiming at what is impossible; whereas that of imitating reality by means of <i>appearance
</i>is pleasant, easy, and very possible. When, therefore, we take a mirror and
carry it round, we easily take the <i>impression </i>of real objects, and show
the figures of each of them.&quot; From this example let us transfer the
comparison to the subject under discussion, so that the mirror may stand for
what is termed by Aristotle the &quot;Place of Forms in <i>potentiality&quot; </i>for
the <i>real </i>forms. But these forms themselves must necessarily exist in <i>activity
</i>before existing in potentiality, and consequently prior to our soul (which
is the opinion of Aristotle) that contains these forms in potentiality. Where,
therefore, are we to place these things that exist first of all in activity?
Must we place them in things united with Matter? No, for <i>these </i>are
evidently the latest in rank. The only alternative left us, is to look for the <i>immaterial
</i>causes in activity, previously established, of things <i>material, prior to </i>which
our soul has existed, and together <i>with </i>which it has emanated from its
source, and <i>out </i>of which it receives (as do mirrors from real objects),
as a necessary consequence, the reasons of Forms, and communicates them through
the agency of its nature unto Matter, as well as to the material bodies. Now
that Nature is the <i>maker </i>of these bodies, we all know, <A NAME="p261"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|261</SPAN></A>
inasmuch as she is, as it were, the entire Nature of the universe; that she is
also the maker of each individual part is, I fancy, self-evident and certain.
But Nature in activity is distinct from Imagination (<font FACE="SPIonic">fantasi/a</font>)<i>
</i>in us, whilst the soul, which is superior to her, has received the property
of Imagination. If, then, it is allowed that Nature possesses the <i>cause </i>of
the things whereof she does not possess the <i>conception, </i>why in God's Name
shall we not allow the same to hold good, and in a still higher degree, in the
case of the soul, where we already <i>know </i>by means of imagination, and <i>discover
</i>by means of the reason? For who is there so fond of cavilling as to allow
that Nature possesses the <i>material </i>reasons (if not all alike in activity)
at least all in potentiality, and yet refuse the same to the soul? If,
therefore, Forms exist in Nature in potentiality, but not in activity, they
certainly do exist in the Soul potentially in a purer and more distinct manner,
so as to be comprehended and be known, although by no means in activity. To what
shall we fasten the <i>cables </i>of this continuous generation? Where shall we
mentally fix <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> our reasonings concerning the eternal
duration of the world? The circulating Body <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> is
certainly made up out <A NAME="p262"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|262</SPAN></A> of <i>subject
</i>and <i>form. </i>This is a necessary consequence unless these two exist in
activity, separate from each other; but, by thought at least, all the former
must be regarded as existing the first,<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and as the
more ancient. Since, therefore, a certain Cause is allowed to have preceded
material forms, being itself entirely immaterial, under the &quot;Third
Creator&quot; (who <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> is to us father and<sup> </sup>lord,
not of these objects only, but also of the Visible and Fifth Body), so we
separate from the former [the Third Creator] <i>Attis </i>as the Cause that
descends as far as the region of Matter, and we regard this Attis as the
generative Power and the Gallos at one and the same time----him who, as Fable
tells, was exposed by the side of the streams of the river <i>Gallos, </i>and
there grew up, and afterwards, when he had got tall and handsome, became the
favourite of the Mother of the Gods, and she committed to his care all other
things, and placed upon his head the star-bespangled cap. Now if the head of
Attis be covered by this visible heaven,<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> ought we
not perchance to interpret the river Gallos as signifying the <i>span of the
Milky Way, </i>for at that point, it is said, that the body which is susceptible
of passion mixes with the impassive circular orbit of the Fifth Body? As far as
this limit truly hath the Mother of the Gods allowed this minion of her's to <i>leap
</i>about and <i>dance----</i>namely, he that resembles the <i>sunbeams</i>,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A><i>
</i>this <i>intelligible </i>Power, Attis. And when the same is <A NAME="p263"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|263</SPAN></A>
arrived at the extremity of his limits, he is said in the fable to have
descended into the Cave,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> and conversed with the
nymph, symbolizing the <i>duplicity </i>of Matter, and it is not Matter itself
that is here meant, but the ultimate Cause of things incorporeal, which also
existed before Matter. Moreover, it is asserted by Heraclitus: &quot;Death unto
souls is but a change to <i>liquid.</i>&quot;<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
This Attis, therefore, the intelligible Power, the holder together of things
material below the Moon, having intercourse with the pre-ordained Cause of
Matter, holds intercourse therewith, not as a male with a female, but as though
flowing into it, since he is the same with it.</p>
<p>Who then is the Mother of the Gods? She is the Source of the Intelligible and
Creative Powers, which direct the visible ones; she that gave birth to and
copulated with the mighty Jupiter: she that exists as a great goddess next to
the Great One, and in union with the Great Creator; she that is dispenser of all
life; cause of all birth; most easily accomplishing all that is made; generating
without passion; creating all that exists in concert with the Father; herself a
virgin, without mother, sharing the throne of Jupiter, the mother in very truth
of all the gods; for by receiving within herself the causes of all the
intelligible deities that be above the world, she became the source to things
the objects of intellect. Now this goddess, who is also the same as Providence,
was seized with a love without passion for Attis. And according to her will and
pleasure made not only material things, but in a still higher degree the causes
of the same. Now the fable relates how that the <i>Virginity,</i> <A NAME="p264"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|264</SPAN></A>
which preserves that things that be born and those that die, became enamoured of
the creative and generative cause of these things, and commanded it to conceive,
in preference, within the intelligible world, and to turn itself towards her,
and to consort with her; that she made an injunction it should do so with none
of the other Powers; whereby it should at once preserve the unity of form that
conduces to preservation, and escape all tendency towards Matter; also she
commanded this Cause to look up to herself (because she is the source of the
creative Powers), without being drawn down or seduced into generation. For in
this way the great Attis would become more powerfully creative, inasmuch as in
every case the aiming at the better is more effective than the declination
towards the worse. For in fact the Fifth Body is more creative through the
former, than through the latter tendency,<sup><A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> </sup>and
likewise more divine in consequence of its directing itself towards the gods;
since the <i>body, </i>even though it were composed of the purest tether, no one
would presume to say was superior to the <i>soul </i>that was both un-defiled
and pure, such as was the soul of Hercules, which emanated from the Creator. And
yet this soul was more effective when she had given it to a body. For unto this
very Hercules the superintendence of things below had been rendered more easy
now that he is returned entire to his entire Father, than was it of old time
when he wore flesh and lived amongst men. Thus in all cases the going away
towards the better is more productive of effect than the turning towards the
worse. And this the legend aims at teaching when it makes the Mother of the Gods
enjoin upon Attis to be her servant, and not to stray from her, and not fall in
love with another woman. But he went forward, and descended as far as the
boundaries of Matter. But when it became necessary for this <A NAME="p265"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|265</SPAN></A>
<i>ignorance&nbsp; </i><A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> to cease and be
stopped----then Corybas,<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> the mighty Sun, the
colleague of the Mother of the Gods (he that creates, and contrives all things
beforehand, in unison with her, and who does nothing without her), persuades the
<i>lion </i>to turn informer. Who then is this lion? We hear him styled
&quot;blazing&quot;----he must, therefore, I think, be the cause presiding over
the <i>hot </i>and<i> fiery </i>element; that which was about to wage war
against the <i>Nymph, </i>and to make her jealous of her intercourse with Attis;
and who this Nymph is we have already stated.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
This lion, the fable tells, lent his aid to the Mother of the Gods, that is, to
the <i>creative Providence of things that be; </i>and by his detecting the
offence and turning informer, became the author of the castration of the youth.
Now this &quot;castration&quot; signifies a check to <i>ignorance</i>;<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i>
</i>for the business of generation stood still in the ordained forms, being
checked by the creative Providence of the universe, not without the intervention
of the fabled madness of Attis; which madness, running wild and overleaping all
bound, and therefore deprivative of all strength, and not possible to be kept
under command, was a thing which it is not unreasonable to suppose is due to the
Final Cause of the gods. Contemplate and consider the Fifth Body----how it
remains <A NAME="p266"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|266</SPAN></A> free from change during
every change, in the case of the illuminations of the moon; in order that
finally the world so constantly renewed, and continually destroyed, may be near
to the Fifth Body. With regard to her <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
illuminations we observe the occurrence of a certain change, and particular
effects taking place simultaneously. It is not therefore unreasonable to suppose
this Attis a sixper-natural personage (in fact the fable implies as much), or
rather in all respects, a deity, seeing that he comes forth out of the Third
Creator, and returns again after his castration, to the Mother of the Gods,
after he has persuaded himself to incline completely <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
towards him, although he seemed at first to have a tendency towards Matter. One
will not be wrong in taking him for the last of the <i>gods, </i>although the <i>foremost
</i>of all things not human. For this reason the fable styles him a
&quot;demi-god,&quot; in order to express the difference between him and the
unchangeable deities. The Corybantes, who are assigned by the Great Mother to
act as his bodyguard, are the <i>three primal Substances </i><A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
of the superior kinds, that come next to the gods. He also rules over the lions,
which together with their chief, Leo (the Zodiacal Sign), having a hot and fiery
nature allotted to them, are the causes of the element <i>Fire </i>in the first
instance, and by means of the <i>heat </i>resulting therefrom, are the authors
of the Exciting Energy, and also of preservation to all the rest. He is crowned
with the heavens instead of a tiara, coming forth as he does, so to speak, from
thence unto us. This great god of ours is Attis; this is the meaning of the
&quot;Flight of King Attis&quot; that we have just been lamenting; his
&quot;Concealments,&quot; his &quot;Vanishings,&quot; his &quot;Descents into
the Cave.&quot; Let my evidence be the time of year when all these <A NAME="p267"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|267</SPAN></A>
ceremonies take place; for it is said that the <i>Sacred Tree </i><A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
is cut down at the moment when the Sun arrives at the extreme point of the
equinoctial arc: next in order follows the Sounding of the trumpets, and lastly
is cut down the sacred and ineffable Harvest of the god Gallos: after these
come, as they say, the Hilaria and festivities. Now that a &quot;cessation of
Indefinity&quot;<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> is meant by the castration so
much talked of by the vulgar, is self-evident from the fact that when the Sun
touches the equinoctial circle, where that which is most definite is placed (for
<i>equality </i>is definite, but <i>inequality </i>indefinite and inexplicable);
at that very moment (according to the report), the Sacred Tree is cut down; then
come the other rites in their order; whereof some are done in compliance with
rules that be holy and not to be divulged; others for reasons allowable to be
discussed. The &quot;Cutting of the Tree;&quot; this part refers to the legend
about the Gallos, and has nothing to do with the rites which it accompanies; for
the gods have thereby, I fancy, taught us symbolically that we ought to pluck
what is most beautiful on earth, namely <i>virtue joined with piety, </i>and
offer the same unto the goddess, for a token of good government here below. For
the Tree springs up out of the earth and aspires upwards into the air; it is
likewise beautiful to see and be seen, and to afford us shade in hot weather;
and furthermore to produce, and regale us with its fruit; thus a large share of
a generous nature resides in it. The rite, therefore, enjoins upon us who are <i>celestial
</i>by our nature, but who have been carried down to <i>earth, </i>to reap
virtue joined with piety from our conduct upon earth, and to aspire upwards unto
the deity, the primal source of being and the fount of life. Then immediately
after the cutting does the trumpet give out the invocation to Attis and <A NAME="p268"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|268</SPAN></A>
to those that be of heaven, whence we took our flight, and fell down to earth.
And after this, when King Attis checks the Indefinity by the means of
castration, the gods thereby warn us to <i>extirpate </i>in ourselves all
incontinence, and to imitate the example,<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> and to
run upwards unto the Definite, and the Uniform, and if it be possible, to the
One itself; which being accomplished the &quot;Hilaria&quot; must by all means
follow. For what could be more contented, what more <i>hilarious </i>than the
soul that has escaped from uncertainty, and generation, and the tumult that
reigns therein, and hastens upwards to the gods? Of whose number was this Attis,
whom the Mother of the Gods would not suffer to advance farther than was proper
for him, but turned him towards herself, and enjoined him to check all
indefinity.</p>
<p>And let nobody suppose me to say that all these things were done and happened
formerly without the gods themselves knowing what they meant to do; or as though
they were chastising their own faults. The causes of things that be, the
ancients (whether with the gods to guide them, or discovering them by their
unassisted efforts, but better to say seeking them out under the guidance of the
gods), when they <i>had </i>discovered them, wrapped up the same in strange
fables, in order that the fiction, being detected through its own extravagance
and obscurity, might 'draw us on to the investigation of the Truth. For the
vulgar, incapable of reasoning, derive sufficient benefit from what is conveyed
by means of symbols; whilst to those of superior intellect, the truth respecting
the gods will then only be serviceable, when they through diligent research
shall find it out and lay hold thereof: whilst they are reminded by means of
dark legends that it is their duty to <i>inquire; </i>and that they may advance
to the end, as to the summit of the thing, after they have discerned it by means
of such research; not so much out of <A NAME="p269"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|269</SPAN></A>
respect and confidence in the judgment of others, as in the exertion of one's
own understanding upon other objects. What then do we assert as the fact----to
consider it, as it were, in a summary? That as far as the Fifth Body, not merely
the Intelligible, but also the Visible bodies, because they belong to the
impassive and divine part, the ancients believed to be gods free from all
mixture: whilst through the generative activity of the gods simultaneously
existing in this same region of the universe, <i>Matter </i>had emanated in
company with these gods from all eternity. Whilst out of these gods, and through
their agency (on account of the superabundance of their generative and creative
faculty), the Providence of things that be, uniting itself from all eternity
with the gods, became at once Colleague of the Mighty Jupiter, and Source of the
Intelligible Powers; whilst what appears without life, without generative
power----the refuse, and what one may call the off-scouring, dregs, and sediment
of things that be----(was made) by means of the lowest in order of all the gods,
that is to say, by him in whom the beings of all the gods terminate; and this
maker has regulated, corrected, and; changed the same for the better. For this
Attis wears the star-spangled tiara----evidently meaning that he has. ordered
the visible limits of the influence of all the gods upon the Sensible world, to
be the <i>beginnings </i>of his own kingdom. Above him was the Unmixed and Pure,
extending as far upwards as the Milky Way; but round about this place (where the
passive element mingles with the impassive, and <i>Matter </i>exists
simultaneously from that same source) his intercourse with the latter is
symbolized by his &quot;Descent into the Cave&quot;: a <i>descent </i>not indeed
made against the will of the gods and of the Mother of them all, although said
to have been made against their will. For the gods being by nature in superior
place, the Better Part seeks not to drag them down from thence to this
condition, but rather by means of the united descending of the Better Part, to
draw the latter up to the <A NAME="p270"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|270</SPAN></A>
superior, and what is more acceptable to the gods, the limit already mentioned.
In this sense the Great Mother is described as not <i>hating </i>Attis after his
castration; nay more, she is described as no longer wrath with him: she was
wrath with him on account of the descent into the Cave, because he, being a god
and superior, had given himself up to his inferior: and after he had of his own
accord checked the progress of his straying out of bounds, and had reduced to
order this disorder by means of his subjection to the same influences with the
equinoctial circle (in order that the mighty Sun may govern that which is most
perfect in measure in his appointed course),<sup><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
</sup>then does the Goddess gladly recall him to herself, or rather retains him
by her side. And there never was a time when these things followed another order
than they do now: ever is Attis minister and charioteer to the Great Mother;
ever does he stimulate generation; perpetually does he <i>cut away </i>from
himself all <i>extravagance </i><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> (want of
limitation) by means of the ordained Cause of Forms. And returning, as it were,
out of the bowels of the earth, he is said to sway his ancestral sceptre:
although never deposed therefrom, nor to be deposed; yet, as the legend goes,
deposed on account of his intercourse with the passive element. One point,
however, is perhaps worth discussion: how it is that, the Equinox being <i>double,
</i>Attis has preferred that which falls in Scorpio's Claws to that falling in
Aries. The reason for this preference is plain enough in my opinion. For at what
time the Sun is <A NAME="p271"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|271</SPAN></A> beginning to
approach us from the equinoctial line, and the length of day is on the
increase----this season was, I think, considered the most suitable to the
subject; for besides the reason which asserts that <i>light </i>is the
accompaniment of the gods,<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> they believed (the
ancients) that the attractive rays of the Sun were favourable to all those who
aimed at being released from the trammels of generation. Consider the matter by
the light of experience: the Sun draws up all things out of the earth, he calls
up to himself and causes them to spring aloft by means of his stimulating and
wondrous heat, penetrating all bodies with the extremest subtilty; whilst the
objects that naturally have a downward tendency he renders light. And such facts
as these we ought, I think, to take for illustrations of his <i>invisible </i>operations;
for he that forces such results in bodies by means of his corporeal heat, cannot
but by means of the invisible, entirely spontaneous, divine and pure activity
existing in his beams, draw up and attract to himself the blessed souls. When
therefore he has displayed this light, so congenial to the gods, and to men
desirous of ascending unto him, and whilst this light is on the increase, so
that the day shall be longer than the night, and the Sovereign Sun is beginning
to traverse the Sign of the Ram, at that time the attractive nature of the rays
of this deity is manifested both by their visible operation and their invisible,
whereby innumerable souls are drawn upwards, following the guidance of the most
luminous and most sun-like of all the senses. For this ocular sense Plato hath
extolled as not so much pleasant and useful for the purposes of daily life, as
it is a guide in the acquisition of wisdom in a higher point of view. But if I
should touch upon that unspeakable mystic science which the Chaldaean hath
uttered through inspiration, concerning the &quot;god of the seven rays&quot;<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
making souls ascend <A NAME="p272"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|272</SPAN></A> <i>through </i>him,
I shall be speaking of things unknown; yea, altogether unknown to the vulgar,
yet familiar unto the blessed ministers of the gods, wherefore I shall now pass
it over in silence.</p>
<p>But to return to what I was saying, namely, that we must suppose the season
for the festival was fixed by those of old time not without consideration, but
rather with plausible, in the highest degree, and well grounded reasons, a proof
of this is that the goddess in question has the equinoctial line assigned to
her. For under the Sign Libra the solemn and ineffable mysteries are celebrated
in honour of Ceres and her daughter, and with good cause is this done, for it
was fitting that they should be held a second time in honour of the god (Sun) as
he is leaving us, in order that we may suffer nothing unpleasant from that
goddess and dark Power <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> which then gets the upper
hand. At any rate, the Athenians celebrate the Mysteries to Ceres twice a year;
in the Sign Aries they celebrate, it is said, the Lesser Mysteries; the greater
they hold when the Sun is in the Claws of Scorpio; for the reasons already
stated. I believe them to be called &quot;Greater&quot; and &quot;Lesser&quot;
Mysteries, for other reasons, but particularly as is probable for <i>this, </i>their
being held when the Sun is <i>receding, </i>rather than when he is <i>approaching
</i>us; wherefore in the latter case they are done merely as a reminder; because
the preserving and sublimating deity is still present, the preliminaries of the <i>Initiation
</i>are marked out; then, shortly after, continuous practices of religion, and
purifications connected with the rites; and when the deity later is taking his
departure for the zone opposite to our land, then, the crowning rite of the
ceremonies is performed for the sake of our protection and preservation. <A NAME="p273"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|273</SPAN></A>
And observe how in this case also the final cause of generation is cut away, for
amongst the Athenians also those that handle the holy things are strictly
continent; and the Hierophant who presides over them shuns all generation,
inasmuch as he has nothing to do with progression into indefinity, but on the
contrary, is concerned with the Essence that is definite, that abides for ever,
and is comprehended in the <i>One, </i>the which also is free from admixture,
and pure. On this subject, thus much is sufficient. It now remains for us in
continuation to discuss this observance of strict <i>continence </i>and of <i>purity
</i>in order that we may extract them from whatever bears upon our hypothesis.
And at first starting, this thing appears to everybody an absurdity, that the
sacred rule allows one to touch flesh, and prohibits one's touching seeds. Are
not the latter without life, the former possessing life? Are not the latter
clean, the former filled with blood and much that is disagreeable both to the
sight and to the hearing? Whilst the former possess the additional
recommendation that no one is aggrieved by the eating of them, whereas in the
other case there is the slaughtering and throat-cutting of the beasts, which
feel pain in consequence, as is natural, and make a roaring noise. Thus much
many superior souls may possibly say; what follows, even the most impious of
mankind nowadays ridicule, namely, that the <i>stalks </i>of vegetables are
eaten; but their roots, for example turnips, are refused; that figs are allowed
to be eaten, but pomegranates by no means, and apples, besides. This I have
frequently heard many people whining at; and though I have said it already, I
consider myself especially indebted to all the gods together, and more than all
to the Great Mother in this particular instance (as in all others) that she did
not suffer me to wander about, as it were in the dark, but firstly commanded me
to <i>cut away, </i>not as regards my <i>body, </i>but as regards the irrational
appetites and motions of the <i>soul, </i>all that was superfluous and empty, by
the aid of the Cause, the object of intellect, and which <A NAME="p274"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|274</SPAN></A>
presides over souls, whilst she herself enabled me to conceive certain notions
perhaps not discordant with a true, and at the same time, reverential
understanding of divine matters. But I seem to be running around in a circle, as
though I had nothing that I could say. It is in my power, even by giving
particulars, to adduce clear and convincing reasons why it is not allowable for
us to bring to table those vegetables and fruits, which are prohibited by the
sacred rule; and this I will do a little further on. At present, it is better to
produce some types, as it were, and models; by following which, even though in
my haste something may be left unnoticed, we may be enabled to form some
judgment on these points. This is the proper place to recapitulate; first of
all, <i>whom I </i>have stated Attis to be, and what is the meaning of his <i>castration;
</i>what is symbolized by the things done <i>between </i>the castration and the
Hilaria, and what the object of the observation of <i>continence.</i> Now, this
Attiis has been defined by me as an Existing Cause, and a deity proximately
creating the.material world; who, when he descends as far as the extreme limits,
is checked by the <i>Sun </i>in his generative motion; when the latter Power
arrives at the sharply defined circumference of the universe, the name whereof
is the <i>Equinoctial line </i>by reason of its effect. His <i>castration, </i>we
have explained to mean the checking of straying beyond bounds ----the which can
only be brought about by his recall and reascension to the more ancient and
original Causes. Of the <i>continence </i>itself, the aim we say is the reascent
of the soul; therefore, in the first place, it forbids the eating of the plants
that sink below the ground, forasmuch as the Earth is the lowest of things that
be; for thither Plato also says that evil things return after having been driven
away; and the gods also by their oracles in many places have called it the
&quot;refuse;&quot; and frequently exhort us to make our escape therefrom. First
of all, therefore, the life-giving and provident goddess doth not allow us even
as far as concerns our bodily nourishment, to make use of things <A NAME="p275"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|275</SPAN></A>
that descend beneath the earth; thereby warning us to look up to heaven, or
rather above the heavens. Some persons, it is true, eat one sort of seed,
namely, kidney beans; because they look upon them as not so much seeds as green
vegetables, on account of their growing in an <i>upward direction </i>and erect,
and not being at all rooted under the earth; for the bean is rooted from the
haulm, in the same way as the fruit of an ivy or of a vine hangs from the tree.
This is the reason why it is forbidden us to use the seed of plants, whilst it
is allowed us to use fruits and green vegetables, not such, however, as creep
along the ground, but those that raise themselves aloft in air. In this way she
commands us to reject as earthy the ground-loving nature of the turnip, whilst
she allows us to bring to table that which grows upwards and aspires on high;
inasmuch as this very action is the mark of purity. At any rate she allows us to
use the stalks of vegetables, whilst she forbids their roots, most especially
those that grow under, and are affected by the same influences as the ground.
And truly the apples of trees, as being holy and goldlike, and the images of the
mystic prizes,<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> and of those given in the
ceremonies, she permits us not to destroy nor to consume; seeing that they
deserve, for the sake of the things they symbolize, to be respected and taken
care of; but pomegranates she has rejected as being an earthy shrub; and the
fruit of the palm tree, some one perhaps will say, in consequence of its not
growing in Phrygia, where the religion was first established. It seems however
to me that it was as a tree sacred to the Sun, and not subject to decay that she
forbids us to consume it, during the fasts, for the nourishment of the body. In
addition to the foregoing rules, she forbids us to use every sort of fish; and
this question concerns us in common with the Egyptians. For my part <A NAME="p276"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|276</SPAN></A>
I think that for two reasons we should abstain from fish, ----best entirely; or,
at any rate, during the time of fasting; and firstly because we ought not to eat
of things the which it is not lawful to sacrifice unto the gods,<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
and here perhaps some dainty and gluttonous persons may raise objection, as I
remember to have been often served before on different occasions when they heard
me explaining for what reason we do not offer sacrifice of fish to the gods. But
in reality we have something to say in reply to this objection; for we <i>do </i>offer
them up, I replied, in the sacrifices of <i>Initiation, </i>in the same way as
the Romans to the <i>horse; </i>and many other beasts and living things, for
example the <i>dog </i>to Hecate (like the Greeks and the Romans also); and
there are many similar victims belonging to initiatory rites amongst other
nations, offered by the community either once or twice a year; although not in
the <i>honorary </i>sacrifices of which alone it is lawful for the gods to
partake and banquet upon. Now fishes we do not offer up in the honorary
sacrifices, because they are things that we do not pasture, nor do we take care
of their breeding; neither have we herds of fish in the same way as we have of
sheep and of oxen. For these latter animals, being fed and made to multiply
through our care, may justly be applied to our other uses, and above everything
else, to the purpose of the most honorific sacrifices. This is one reason why I
think we are not allowed to use fish for food during the times of fasting. There
is yet another, and which I fancy is more consonant with what has been already
said----namely, that fishes from their habit of <i>sinking to the bottom, </i>are
more of an earthy nature than seeds-themselves; whilst he that desires to soar
upwards, and to fly aloft above the air unto the very pinnacles of heaven, will
with good cause reject all things of the kind; he will emulate and run after
those that aspire upwards into air, <A NAME="p277"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|277</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>that aim at ascension, and to speak poetically, that <i>gaze </i>at
heaven. Birds, our religion allows us to eat, with the exception of a few that
are held sacred by the common consent of mankind; and also the usual quadrupeds,
except the swine; the latter as being <i>earthy </i>in all respects, in form, in
habits, in the very article of its nature, (for it is full of superfluity, and
bloated in body) is justly proscribed from the holy table. For this beast is
believed to be an acceptable offering to the infernal gods, and not without good
reason, for it is without sight of heaven, not merely never attempting, but even
naturally made incapable of looking upwards. Such are the reasons that the holy
institution assigns for abstinence from the things whence we are bound to
abstain; and which we, who understand them, communicate to those who believe in
the gods.</p>
<p>But as regards what we are permitted to eat, I make this observation. The
holy rule does not allow all indiscriminately, but keeping in view what is
within the power of human nature, allows us to make use of these common things,
not in order that we should all of us necessarily consume all such things (for
this perhaps were no easy matter), but that, firstly, each might use whatever
his own constitution should permit: secondly, a larger supply for human wants is
the consequence of such variety; and, thirdly, it is attended by the exercise of
<i>will</i>,<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A><i> </i>which last it is right to
strain to the utmost in matters of religion, so as to be zealous and to exert
one's self, even beyond one's strength to follow the divine rules. Such conduct
is the more serviceable to the soul as regards its health, supposing that one
makes greater account of <i>it, </i>and not of the health of the body. Nay, as
regards the <i>body, </i>it will ultimately prove to have participated
unconsciously in this more estimable and still greater benefit. For when <A NAME="p278"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|278</SPAN></A>
the soul gives itself up completely to the gods, committing all that concerns
itself entirely to its superiors, whilst purity of life is the consequence, and
previous to this the divine rules lead the way where is nothing further that
confines or trammels it; for all things are in the power of the gods, and all
things subsist around the gods,<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> and all things
are full of the gods; thereupon does the divine light illumine their souls, and
being themselves rendered divine, they impart a tension and a strength to the
spirit,<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A><sup> </sup>to which they are united at
birth, whilst the latter, being thus sharpened and at the same time governed by
the soul, becomes the source of health to the whole body. That probably all
bodily diseases, or at any rate the greater number and the worst, arise from the
upsetting and depravation of the animal spirits, as I fancy none of the sons of
Esculapius will deny, for some say this of <i>all </i>diseases, others of the
most numerous, the worst, and the most difficult to cure. Testimony to this fact
are the oracles of the gods; I mean that not only the soul, but the body
likewise, is rendered worthy of much benefit and health by means of this purity
of living. For, as they say, &quot;The mortal envelope of bitter Matter is
likewise preserved,&quot; as the gods promise in encouragement to the extremely
pure amongst their own ministers.</p>
<p>What subject then remains for us to handle----especially when we are confined
within the short space of a single night, and have read nothing beforehand, or
made any research into these matters, nay, without any previous intention of
writing about them, before asking for these tablets; the goddess will bear
witness to what I say. But as I was <A NAME="p279"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|279</SPAN></A>
saying, what else is left for us to do, save to commemorate the goddess
conjointly with Athene and Bacchus ----the festivals of whom, in truth, the law
has fixed during the time of this fast, perceiving doubtless the relationship
that exists between Athene and the Mother of the Gods, because of the <i>provident
nature </i>common to both, having also an eye to the separate creative operation
of Bacchus, which power the mighty Bacchus has received from the mighty Jupiter,
inasmuch as he has emanated out of <i>him, </i>and has communicated the same to
all the visible creation, while he directs and governs the universal separate
creation. It is also fitting to make mention of <i>Hermes, </i>entitled
&quot;Epaphroditus &quot;----for so the god is styled by those initiated
persons, who profess to kindle torches in honour of Attis &quot;the Wise.&quot;
But who is so thick-headed as not to understand that through Hermes and
Aphrodite are invoked all things in all places that contain the cause <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
of the universality and various forms of generation, which is the proper subject
of my argument? Is not this the Attis, who at first is called <i>insane, </i>and
then <i>sane, </i>in consequence of his castration?<i> Insane </i>because he
chose for himself the realm of Matter, and superintends the work of generation;
but <i>sane </i>because he hath modelled this refuse into Beauty, and hath
wrought therein so great a transformation, that no skill or craft of man can
imitate the same. But what shall be the conclusion of my theme? Verily a Hymn of
praise unto the goddess. O Mother of gods and men, assister and colleague of
mighty Jove! O source of the Intelligible Powers! Thou that keepest thy course
in unison with the simple essences of things intelligible; thou that hast
received out of all the universal Cause, and impartest it to the Intelligible
world! Goddess, giver of life, Mother, Providence, and Maker of our souls! Thou
that lovest the mighty Bacchus; who didst preserve Attis when he was cast forth,
and didst recall him to <A NAME="p280"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|280</SPAN></A> thyself
after he had sunk down into the cave of the earth; thou that art the beginning
of all Good unto the Intelligible Powers, and that fillest the world with all
the objects of Sense, and grantest all good things, in all places, unto mankind!
Grant unto all men happiness, of which the sum and substance is the <i>knowledge
of the gods; </i>and to the Roman people universally, first and foremost to wash
away from themselves the stain of <i>atheism</i>,<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
and in addition to this, grant them propitious Fortune, that shall assist them
in governing the empire for many thousands of years to come! To myself grant for
the fruit of my devotion to thee----Truth in belief concerning the gods, the
attainment of perfection in religious rites, and in all the undertakings which
we attempt as regards warlike or military <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
measures, valour coupled with good luck, and the termination of my life to be
without pain, and happy in the good hope of a departure for your abodes!</p>

<i>ex. gr., </i>those figured on the imperial copper of Byzantium, is that of a <i>pomegranate.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#32"></A>32.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> This may have been the very reason
why the Christians allowed fish to be eaten during their own fasts, out of the

</i>takes the place of his first, and holds the same relation to the <font FACE="SPIonic">fu&amp;xh</font><i>
</i>that the latter holds to the body. This is fully and curiously set forth by
Plutarch in his &quot;Face in the Moon.&quot;</p>

Christianity, the denial of <i>his </i>gods.</p>

was contemplating in the constitution of the army, which was kept secret until
the successful termination of the Persian War should enable him to carry it out,
in defiance of all opposition from the officials interested in the existing
corruption.</p>
