<p align="center"><b>Zachariah of Mitylene, Syriac Chronicle (1899).&nbsp; Book
5.</b></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">BOOK V</h3>
<p>THE fifth Book (in its twelve chapters, which are written down distinctly
below) tells of Basiliscus and Marcus the Illustrious;<i><sup> </sup></i>and the
encyclical letter which they Wrote to the bishops of their dominion, in which
also they anathematised the Synod of Chalcedon and the Tome. For after eighteen
years of banishment in Gangra and Cherson, Timothy the Great returned and
arrived at Constantinople; and then he and Paul the Sophist, and James, and
Theopompus, his chosen monks, persuaded Basiliscus to write the <i>Encyclical. </i>It
also tells about the petition sent by the bishops of Asia, who met at Ephesus
and subscribed to the <i>Encyclical.</i></p>
<p>Moreover, it tells about some Eutychian monks then residing at
Constantinople, who, along with Zenaia the king's wife, basely conspired against
Timothy to have him sent again into banishment. Whereupon he departed to
Ephesus. And by means of a Synod, which he convened, he reinstated Paul there,
and gave him the rights of the Patriarchate that the Synod of Chalcedon had
taken away from him, and had given to the royal city, through the flattery and
treachery of John, whom they made bishop instead of Bassian. For the latter
resigned, and departed and went into banishment. Now Timothy was received with
much state. And without any rancour he admitted to his communion the penitents
from the Proterian party and from that of Timothy Salophaciolus, who was driven
out before him by the king's command. <A NAME="p102"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|102</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this Book also relates the deeds of Acacius in Constantinople, and how he
raised an insurrection and rebellion against Basiliscus ; and he took possession
of the Churches; and he compelled Basiliscus to write the <i>Antencyclical, </i>and
to deny his former letter. And the bishops again subscribed to this <i>Antencyclical,
</i>with the exception of Amphilochius of Side and Epiphanius of Magdolum. And
then Zeno returned and became emperor, and he thrust out Basiliscus, and
cancelled every law and enactment which he had made. And when he was wishing to
depose Timothy, the latter died, having retained his See to the end; and Peter,
who became bishop in his stead, hid from the threats of Zeno.</p>
<p>Then Timothy Salophaciolus returned, and took possession of the church, and
sought for Peter. But this Book further tells about John the archimandrite, who
was sent to Zeno with the petition of the party of Timothy Salophaciolus,
praying for an order that, after the death of Timothy, one of their side should
be the bishop in Alexandria. Now this John coveted the see for himself. And Zeno
heard it; and, with the object of trying him, he required from him an oath in
the presence of the Senate, and also of Bishop Acacius, that he would not take
the bishopric.</p>
<p>And John then returned to Alexandria, bearing an order from the king that, in
succession to Timothy, any of his party whom the citizens might desire should be
appointed as bishop. But about the same time it happened that this Timothy
Salophaciolus died. And then John transgressed his oath, and used bribery to get
the bishopric there for himself. But when Zeno heard of it, through the report
of eminent believers among the monks there who went up to him and informed him
of all the events which had occurred in Alexandria from the time of the Synod,
he was greatly moved; and he changed his mind, and wrote a letter called the
&quot;Henotikon.&quot;</p>
<p>And he gave orders that Peter should return to his place, upon the condition
of his receiving the Henotikon, and that John the liar should be deprived.
Whereupon John repaired to Rome, and declared that he had suffered deprivation
for <A NAME="p103"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|103</SPAN></A> the sake of the Synod and the
Tome. And then Zeno wrote to the Patriarch there, and exposed John.</p>
<p>But Peter of Antioch also returned and convened a Synod, and received the
Henotikon.</p>
<p>And in like manner, Acacius of Constantinople and Martyrius of Jerusalem, the
successor of Anastasius.</p>
<p>And they all, except the bishop of Rome, wrote synodical letters, and
received Peter of Alexandria into their communion.</p>
<p>But certain zealous monks withdrew from Peter and became separatists, because
he had received the Henotikon in which there was no express anathema of the
Synod. And Peter thrust them out from their monasteries. Accordingly some of
them went up to Zeno and persuaded him to send back with them Cosmas the <i>Spatharius,
</i>to inquire<i> </i>into their matter; and at another time he sent Arsenius
the prefect, and a prolonged dispute ensued.</p>
<p>These, indeed, are the matters which are written expressly in the twelve
chapters of this fifth Book, which (so to speak) has been translated from the
same Greek History of Zachariah, and has here been written in the Syriac
language for the study and instruction of the diligent, that they may learn the
events that occurred in former times.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER I</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK TELLS HOW TIMOTHY RETURNED FROM BANISHMENT
  AFTER THE DEATH OF LEO; AND THAT IT WAS HE WHO URGED BASILISCUS TO WRITE THE
  ENCYCLICAL LETTER</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Timothy had completed eighteen years in banishment, and Leo the emperor
was dead, and Zeno, his successor, had received the kingdom, the people of
Alexandria, observing this crisis in imperial affairs, sent a petition by
certain chosen, and (as we may say) illustrious and noble monks, among them Amon
who was called the wild bull, and Paul who had been a <A NAME="p104"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|104</SPAN></A>
sophist, and Theorion and James the miracle-workers, and Theopompus the brother
of the master of the offices.</p>
<p>However,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> in consequence of a rebellion that was
raised against Zeno by Basiliscus, the brother of Verina the wife of Leo, who
had been associated with Zeno in the command of the army in the days of Leo,
Zeno had betaken himself to the strongholds called Salmon; and Basiliscus had
assumed the crown. And he appointed Theoctistus his physician, an Alexandrian,
the brother of this Theopompus the monk, as master of the offices.</p>
<p>Now<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> when these monks entered into the royal
presence, the king, and the courtiers, and the queen were struck with admiration
of them. But also Theoctistus the master of the offices and Acacius the bishop
rendered them assistance.</p>
<p>So Basiliscus issued an order that Timothy should return from banishment.</p>
<p>And at first Acacius was preparing a lodging for him at the church called <i>Irene</i>;
and he was setting apart some of his own clergy for his retinue and service. But
afterwards, because he thought that they were forming a plan to make Theopompus
bishop at the royal city instead of him, Acacius was distressed and indignant;
and he endeavoured to put a stop to Timothy's coming. However, he did not
succeed. For he returned, and was welcomed with great state by the Alexandrian
sailors and the people who happened to be then in Constantinople. And he went to
lodge in the king's palace. And large numbers were coming to him to be blessed,
and to be sanctified, and to receive healing from him. And becoming intimate
both with Basiliscus and his wife, Timothy,<sup><A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> </sup>along
with those who happened to be there with him and on his behalf, persuaded the
king, so that he consented to write encyclical letters, in which he would
anathematise the Tome and the addition which was made at Chalcedon. For Paul the
monk, who was a rhetorician and a sophist, drew them up. And it was he who, in a
discussion with Acacius the patriarch, <A NAME="p105"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|105</SPAN></A>
was able to show that the heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches are one and the
same; though they are generally thought to be diametrically opposed to each
other. For the one, indeed, making objection declares that it would be a
degradation to God to be born of a woman, and to be made in all points like as
we are, by becoming partaker of flesh and blood; whereas He was only partaker by
identity of name, and by power and indwelling, and by operation. But the other,
indeed, for the purpose of liberating and exalting God, so that He should not
suffer degradation and contempt by association with a human body, publishes the
doctrine that He became incarnate from His own essence, and that He assumed a
heavenly body; and that just as there is no part of the seal left upon the wax,
nor of the golden signet upon the clay, so neither did there cleave to Christ
any portion of humanity whatsoever.</p>
<p>And when he spoke in this way, Acacius was astonished at the solidity of his
reasoning, and he assented and agreed. And he went to Timothy and conversed with
him, in a friendly manner, respecting the rights of his see. However, when he
was requested by Timothy to sign the Encyclical, he hesitated.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER II</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SECOND CHAPTER TELLS ABOUT THE ENCYCLICAL LETTER OF BASILISCUS AND
  MARCUS, WHICH IS TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;The king Basiliscus, the believing, victorious, all-virtuous ruler,
Augustus, along with Marcus the most illustrious Caesar, to Timothy the reverend
and God-loving archbishop of the great city Alexandria. Concerning all the laws
justly and righteously enacted by the believing and memorable kings who have
gone before us, for the salvation and good guidance of all <A NAME="p106"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|106</SPAN></A>
the world, and in defence of the true faith as taught by the apostles and holy
fathers ; it is our will that all these laws should be ratified, and not lightly
annulled. Rather do we agree to them, and hold them to be of equal validity with
our own.</p>
<p>&quot;And earnestly desiring to honour the fear of God more than any affair
of man, through zeal for the Lord Jesus Christ our God, to Whom we owe our
creation, exaltation, and glory; moreover also, being fully persuaded that the
unity of His flock is the salvation of ourselves and our people, and is the sure
and immovable foundation, and the lofty bulwark of our kingdom ; we now, moved
by a wise impulse, are bringing union and unity to the Church of Christ in every
part of our dominion, namely, the faith of the three hundred and eighteen
bishops, who being previously prepared by the Holy Ghost, assembled at Nicea,
the security and well-being of human life, the faith which we hold, like all who
have been before us, and in which we believe and are baptized, that it may hold
and rule<sup> </sup>all the Churches with their chosen canons: the faith which
is complete and perfect in all piety and true belief, and which rejects and
exposes all heresies, and thrusts them out of the Church: the faith which the
one hundred and fifty bishops, being assembled here to oppose and condemn the
fighters against the Spirit, the Holy Lord confirmed, and with which they
concurred and agreed : the faith which was also confirmed by the transactions of
the two Councils at Ephesus, along with the chief priests of Rome and
Alexandria, Celestine and Cyril, and Dioscorus, in condemnation of the heretic
Nestorius, and all who after him have held similar opinions, and have confounded
the order of the Church, and disturbed the peace of the world, and cleft asunder
the unity; we mean the Tome of Leo, and the decrees of Chalcedon, whether by way
of definition of the faith, or doctrine, or interpretation, or addition, or
whatsoever other innovation was said or done contrary to the faith and the
definition of the three hundred and eighteen.</p>
<p>&quot;And therefore we command that wherever, here or elsewhere, such written
doctrine be found, it shall be anathematised and burnt in the fire. For in
accordance with this order, our <A NAME="p107"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|107</SPAN></A>
blessed predecessors in the kingdom, Constantine the Great and Theodosius, in
like manner, commanded and ordained. And also, the three subsequent Synods, that
of the one hundred and fifty bishops here, and the two of Ephesus, ratified only
the faith of Nicea, and agreed to the true definition there made.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, we anathematise everyone who does not confess that the
only-begotten Son of God truly became incarnate by the Holy Ghost from the
Virgin Mary; not taking a body from heaven, in mere semblance or phantasy. And
also we anathematise all the false teaching of all those heresies which are
contrary to the true faith of the fathers,&quot; and so on with the rest of the
Encyclical.</p>
<p>To <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><i> </i>this document Timothy agreed and
subscribed ; as did also Peter of Antioch and Paul of Ephesus, who were recalled
from banishment, and the bishops of Asia and the East, and Anastasius of
Jerusalem, and those of his jurisdiction ; so that the number of bishops who
subscribed to the Encyclical is found to be about seven hundred, less or more.
And they anathematised the Tome of Leo and the Synod ; and they sent a petition
to Basiliscus and Marcus, which was as follows:—</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER III</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE THIRD CHAPTER GIVES INFORMATION RESPECTING THE PETITION OF THE BISHOPS
  OF ASIA, WHO WERE ASSEMBLED AT EPHESUS, AND SIGNED THE ENCYCLICAL, AND WHO
  WROTE TO BASILISCUS AND MARCUS TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;To<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> the believing, and Christ-loving,
victorious kings Basiliscus and Marcus the Augusti—Paul and Pergamius, and
Gennadius, and Zenodotus, and Zoticus, and Gennadius, and Theophilus, and the
other bishops assembled at Ephesus:— <A NAME="p108"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|108</SPAN></A>
In all things ye have shown yourselves to be believing and Christ-loving beings;
so that when the true faith suffered persecution by the malice of men, ye also
were persecuted along with it. For there are rebellious and vainglorious men, of
a corrupt mind, foolish and void of the faith of the Son of God, Who humbled
Himself for our sake and became incarnate, and rendered us meet for the adoption
of sons. Be glad, then, and rejoice, and exult, and glory that ye have been
counted worthy to suffer persecution with the faith. For there is reserved for
these men the everlasting judgment of fire which devours the persecutors, and
also the threat of your punishment which is upon them; because they have
despised us, and slandered and belied us, and forced us with violence to agree
to their doctrine.</p>
<p>&quot;But now that the light of the true faith has arisen upon us, and the
dark cloud of error been rolled away from us, we make known by this declaration
our true faith to your Majesties and to all the world. And we say that freely
and with willing consent, by the aid of John the Evangelist as our teacher, we
have signed this Encyclical; and we agree to it and to everything in it, without
compulsion, or fear, or favour of man. And if at any future time violence shall
meet us from man, we are prepared to despise fire and sword and banishment and
the spoiling of our goods, and to treat all bodily suffering with contempt; so
that we may adhere to the true faith. We have anathematised and we do
anathematise the Tome of Leo and the decrees of Chalcedon ; which have been the
cause of much blood-shedding, and confusion, and tumult, and trouble, and
divisions, and strifes in all the world. For we are satisfied with the doctrine
and faith of the apostles and of the holy fathers, the three hundred and
eighteen bishops; to which also the illustrious Council of the one hundred and
fifty in the Royal City, and the two other holy Synods at Ephesus adhered, and
which they confirmed. And we join with them in anathematising Nestorius, and
everyone who does not confess that the only-begotten Son of God was incarnate by
the Holy Ghost, <A NAME="p109"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|109</SPAN></A> of the Virgin
Mary; He becoming perfect man, while yet He remained, without change and the
same, perfect God ; and that He was not incarnate from Heaven in semblance or
phantasy. And we further anathematise all other heresies.&quot; But they wrote
down some other things. And they applauded with loud voice and approved.</p>
<p>But the other bishops also of the various districts wrote another
declaration, the beginning of which was to this effect:</p>
<p>&quot;With the consent of our heart, we hold your Majesties to be in such
accord with our fathers, the three hundred and eighteen bishops, as to make the
three hundred and nineteenth : for you are very zealous for their true faith,
that it may prosper and be preached among all nations in your dominion.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IV</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FOURTH CHAPTER OF THIS SAME FIFTH BOOK NARRATES THE EVENTS WHICH
  OCCURRED IN CONSTANTINOPLE AND EPHESUS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE ENCYCLICAL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> the purport of the king's Encyclical
letters became generally known, certain monks holding opinions similar to those
of Eutyches, who happened to be in the Royal City, came in a body to Timothy,
supposing him to be of their way of thinking, and disputed with him about the
terms of the Encyclical; because it anathematised everyone who affirmed that
Christ was incarnate in semblance. But when he said to them, &quot;What then is
your opinion respecting the Incarnation?&quot; then they brought up to him the
illustration of the signet-ring which, after the impression, leaves no part of
its substance upon the wax or the clay.</p>
<p>And having discovered their sentiments, he admonished and instructed them,
that the Scriptures teach us that Christ <A NAME="p110"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|110</SPAN></A>
was made in all points like unto us, and took our nature perfectly, yet without
the motions of sin. And although He was born supernaturally<i> </i>without
copulation, nevertheless He became perfect Man, having been conceived in the
Virgin Mary, and from her born, through the Holy Ghost. And being incarnate He
yet remained the same and without change in His Godhead.</p>
<p>Then Timothy, having learned by the whole tenor of the conversation of those
who came to him what their mind was, made a written statement, declaring that
Christ was like unto us in everything belonging to humanity. Whereupon the monks
of the place separated themselves from him, saying, &quot;We will have no
communion with the Alexandrians.&quot;</p>
<p>But the others, having discovered that he had no tendency to the Eutychian
doctrine, attached themselves to him.</p>
<p>Then the Eutychianists, joining with their fellows, advised Zenona, the wife
of King Basiliscus, a professor of their creed, that Timothy should be banished
again. However, Theoctistus, the master of the offices, having heard what was
likely to befall him, urged him to leave the city and to proceed without delay
to Alexandria. And<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> he left; and having, on his
journey, arrived at Ephesus, he convened a Synod, and he reinstated Paul who had
formerly been the bishop there, but was in exile at that time for not accepting
the decrees of Chalcedon. To him Timothy canonically restored the rights of his
see, which the Council of Chalcedon had snatched from it, and had given by
partiality to the throne of the royal city.</p>
<p>And Timothy arrived at Alexandria, and he was received with great state, with
torches, and also songs of praise by the various people and languages there, and
even by the members of the Proterian party, who beheld the affection for him
displayed by the citizens. But the band of the priests, and the monks, and the
sisters in Christ, and all the people in a body, chanting their hymns, and
saying, &quot;Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,&quot; conducted
him into the great church. For Timothy Salophaciolus had by the king's command
gone out before him. <A NAME="p111"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|111</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And inasmuch as he was a peaceable and kind man, and also gentle in his
words, and by no means passionate, he remitted to the members of the Proterian
party the term of repentance, which he had written and appointed for the
penitents when he was in banishment.</p>
<p>And even Prolatius (?) himself, who had taken and dragged him from the font
of the Baptistery, he received just as kindly and peaceably as the others,
weeping and comforting him as to his former rebellious and insolent conduct
towards himself.</p>
<p>For, such is the rule of the leaders of the Church, which Timothy truly
showed towards the many, that brotherly charity which seeks not her own, and is
not easily provoked.</p>
<p>But certain persons, who were ignorant of the rights of divine love, severed
themselves from him on account of his gentleness and mildness towards the
penitents, in that he required nothing else from them except that they should
anathematise the Synod and the Tome, and confess the true faith; and because he
did not hold them aloof, even for a little while, from the communion which they
had made desolate.</p>
<p>But at the head of these persons was Theodoret <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i>
</i>the bishop of Joppa, who had been consecrated by Theodosius some time
before. And he was then filled with envy because he had not also been received
back again to his see. And, lo! the illustrious Peter the Iberian did not return
to Gaza; and he did not at all agree with this faction, but he was warmly
attached to Timothy, and he proved that his conduct and actions were in
conformity with the will of God. But the Separatists who sided with Theodotus
fell into such error that they even practised reanointing, and they were called
Anachristo-Novatians.</p>
<p>But the affection of the people for Timothy being great was increased the
more because, by the king's command, he brought the bones of Dioscorus and of
Anatolius his brother, along with him, in a silver coffin, and he buried him
with great state, laying him in the place of the bishops, and honouring <A NAME="p112"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|112</SPAN></A>
him as a confessor. But his charity was so profuse that of his own free will he
appointed that one denarius a day should be given by the Church, for expenditure
and use, to Timothy, who was deposed, and who had been since then supporting
himself by the work of his hands, by weaving baskets and selling them.</p>
<p>And he gave to the great men and rulers of the city a gift, assigning to each
of them three <i>paxamatia </i>apiece. And to King Basiliscus and to the
patricians he only sent the same. And at one time the tax-gatherer came to him
with a royal letter, and he gave him just the same; and he answered and said,
&quot;I want a gift of denarii.&quot; And he said, &quot;It is the duty of the
Church to expend them upon the widows and orphans.&quot;</p>
<p>But the people heard that the prefect there, Boetius by name, was an
Eutychian ; and they cried out in the church, &quot;Pope! pronounce an anathema
upon Nestorius and Eutyches.&quot; And he at once anathematised them by word of
mouth in the presence of the prefect. And thereby he was cleared from the
suspicion of associating with the prefect as an Eutychian.</p>
<p>Such were the transactions at Alexandria.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER V</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF THIS SAME FIFTH BOOK TELLS ABOUT THE PREPARATIONS
  WHICH WERE MADE BY ACACIUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE; AND ABOUT THE
  &quot;ANTENCYCLICALS&quot; ; AND ALSO ABOUT PETER AND PAUL OF ANTIOCH AND OF
  EPHESUS, WHO WERE AGAIN DEPOSED WHEN ZENO THE KING RETURNED AND BASILISCUS WAS
  DRIVEN OUT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Acacius of Constantinople, having heard
respecting Paul of Ephesus that the rightful authority of his see, according <A NAME="p113"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|113</SPAN></A>
to its former constitution, had been restored to him by Timothy; and further,
that Peter had returned to Antioch ; and that they were preparing to hold a
Synod against him at Jerusalem with the intention of deposing himself and
appointing Theopompus, brother of the master of the offices, in his stead : he,
having heard all this, stirred up the monks and urged them on, and brought down
Daniel from the pillar, and took possession of the churches, and raised an
insurrection against Basiliscus, declaring that he was a heretic. Whereupon
Basiliscus, for the report reached him at the same time that Zeno was returning
with a great army, was compelled to make the &quot;Antencyclicals,&quot; by
which he cancelled his former letter.</p>
<p>Then Zeno, upon his return, and the ejection of Basiliscus, passed a law
whereby all the proceedings of Basiliscus were to be cancelled. He also deposed
Peter of Antioch and Paul of Ephesus;<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><i> </i>and
he uttered severe threats against Timothy. However, the latter died, departing
to be with his Lord ; and he was buried with great state, the obsequies being
performed by Peter, who was canonically consecrated as his successor by the
bishops of the country.</p>
<p>But the bishops of Asia made a libel to Acacius, finding fault with the
&quot;Encyclicals&quot;; and they subscribed to the Antencyclicals. In like
manner also, the Eastern bishops made a libel to Calandion, Peter's successor,
whereby they, too, anathematised the &quot;Encyclicals.&quot;</p>
<p>But Anastasius of Jerusalem persevered in his integrity, holding with him the
three provinces of Palestine; and he would not give himself over to this party,
nor would he deny the Encyclicals ; although he freely associated with the
bishops who came together to him.</p>
<p>In like manner also Epiphanius of Magdolum <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> of
Pamphylia, impelled by the greatness of his soul, departed to Alexandria, and
was sojourning in the monasteries there, and was honoured by Timothy and by his
successor Peter.</p>
<p>But King Zeno was greatly enraged when he heard about Peter; and he sent
threats of which Peter had previous <A NAME="p114"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|114</SPAN></A>
intimation, and he hid himself in the city by moving about from one house to
another. But, by the command of King Zeno, Timothy Salophaciolus, who had been
ejected, returned and took possession of the great church, and a tumult and
slaughter ensued upon his entry there.</p>
<p>And Theoctistus, the prefect of the city, was searching for Peter to
apprehend him, when a Voice was heard, saying,</p>
<p>&quot;I will hide him, and I will protect him, because he has known My Name;
he shall call upon Me, and I will answer him ; in the day of trouble I will
sustain him, and I will honour him.&quot; <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A></p>
<p>But Timothy exerted himself by all ways and means to keep the people on his
side. He preached the faith of Nicea and of the one hundred and fifty; he
confessed and agreed to the transactions of Ephesus; he anathematised Nestorius;
and he wrote in the diptych the names of Cyril and Dioscorus, and read them out;
and he did more besides, and yet he was unable to draw the people to himself.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VI</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SIXTH CHAPTER OF THIS SAME BOOK TELLS ABOUT MARTYRIUS, WHO WAS THE
  SUCCESSOR OF ANASTASIUS IN JERUSALEM ; THAT HE ALSO WAS PREACHING THE TRUE
  FAITH TO THE PEOPLE, AND WAS ANATHEMATISING NESTORIUS AND THE SYNOD OF
  CHALCEDON</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Martyrius of Jerusalem was also one of those who, following Anastasius
his predecessor, separated himself from the Antencyclical, and exerted himself
greatly to unite the people. And he gained over Marcianus, an excellent monk ;
and this man received him, and admonished the other monks to do the same. But
those who did not receive him he expelled. And they say that, after his death,
one of his disciples, who was quite blind, prayed to God, saying, &quot;If the
doctrine of our master be indeed the right one, when I lay mine eyes upon his
corpse, let them receive their sight&quot; ; and he received his sight. <A NAME="p115"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|115</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">THE PUBLIC ADDRESS OF MARTYRIUS</p>
<p>&quot;Christ is our peace, Who hath made both one, and has taken down the
middle wall of partition, and has destroyed the enmity by His flesh. For,
behold, the Church is receiving back her sons, who never, indeed, of their own
accord, departed far from her! And now they have shown this to us by deed, and
it is time for us to say, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace upon earth.'</p>
<p>&quot;Wherefore, to their face we the God-loving bishops have blamed these
chaste archimandrites and the excellent clergy, in order in your presence to
convince the rest of our brethren that we have no other true definition of the
faith but that into which we have been and are being baptized. For thus have
they been baptized, and believe as we do.</p>
<p>&quot;Whosoever, then, holds or has held or learned doctrine contrary to this
definition of the faith which was framed by the three hundred and eighteen holy
fathers, the bishops assembled at Nicea; to which definition the one hundred and
fifty believing and true bishops, assembled in the royal city, adhered,
ratifying and confirming the same, as did also the Synod held in Ephesus:
whosoever (I say) holds or has held or learned what is contrary to this
definition, let him be accursed, if he have any other teaching or doctrine
defined elsewhere, whether in Rimini, or in Sardica, or in Chalcedon, or in any
other place whatsoever, according to the saying of the apostle, 'If any man
preaches to you more than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.'
&quot;<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></p>
<p>And again, the same Martyrius spoke in the following terms: &quot;If any man
teaches, or brings in as new, or thinks or interprets, or holds any other
definition or faith contrary to this approved and orthodox doctrine of faith of
the three hundred and eighteen holy bishops and the one hundred and fifty, and
them of Ephesus, he is an alien to the holy Church. <A NAME="p116"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|116</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;And, behold, I adjure you in the sight of God and His Christ, and the
Holy Spirit, and the elect angels, that you do not suffer any man to lead you
astray from this faith! But the confession, signed with your own signatures, lo,
it is recorded in Heaven above! And you shall give account before the fearful
and righteous Judgment-Seat, if you accept anything more or less than the true
faith. I am clear from your blood ; I have not desisted from speaking unto
you.&quot;</p>
<p>By using language such as this, the bishops were admonishing those who
separated from them.</p>
<p>But in Alexandria not one believer would consent to hold communion with
Timothy and his followers.</p>
<p>Then the monks and certain learned and wise men took counsel together, and
they made a supplication to the chiefs of the cities, begging of them that, in
the event of the death of Timothy, they would not accept as bishop any other
member of his party; but that they would only be satisfied with Peter the
believer, who was the lawfully-appointed bishop, although he was then hidden in
retirement. And <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> the partisans of Timothy having
heard of this, drew up a petition and sent it to the king by John, a presbyter
of the Martyr Church of St. John the Baptist, a monk, and also one of the
Tabennesiots.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> And in it they besought the king
that, in the event of the death of Timothy, none but a member of his party
should be made bishop, and that the people of Alexandria should not receive
Peter.</p>
<p>And when John was admitted into the presence of the king, the latter said to
him, for the purpose of trying him, &quot;We think it well that you should
yourself be the bishop there.&quot; For the king had previously learned that he
was in league with Julius<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> the general, who, on
account of his command over the king's army, was preparing an insurrection
against the king, in conjunction with Leontius and Euprepius. <A NAME="p117"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|117</SPAN></A>
And John disclosed this to Julius; and he said to the king,</p>
<p>&quot;I am not worthy.&quot; Then he told him to take counsel upon it. And
when Julius heard it he said to him, &quot;Conceal your feelings, and be careful
not to disclose them before the king.&quot; Then he took an oath in the presence
of Acacius and the senators that he would never be the bishop.</p>
<p>And the king issued an order, and gave it to John, to the effect that any
brother whom the clergy and the people of the city might choose, should be the
successor of Timothy.</p>
<p>But when he returned to the city, he delivered a letter from Julius to
Theognostus the prefect there, who was one of the conspirators with Julius, and
he promised that if he should become bishop he would give the royal vessels
which Arcadius the king devoted to the sanctuary, and presented to Theophilus,
who was the bishop at that time, and he built a church there and called it after
his name.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VII</b></p>

  OBTAINED THE BISHOPRIC BY BRIBERY, AFTER THE DEATH OF TIMOTHY ; AND ABOUT
  CYRUS THE PRESBYTER, WHO WAS IN LEAGUE WITH HIM ; AND ALSO HOW PETER RETURNED
  TO HIS SEE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> a few more days of life only, Timothy
died. Then John belied his own sworn promises, and gave a bribe to Theognostus,
and obtained the bishopric for himself.</p>
<p>But he drew over to his side Cyrus a presbyter, one of those who had formerly
been in association with Dioscorus, and had afterwards forsaken him. This man
also coveting the primacy, at one time would attach himself to Acacius of
Constantinople, and at another time to that Timothy who died; and again, he
would mock and revile Timothy the Great and Peter his successor. So that the
Alexandrians <A NAME="p118"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|118</SPAN></A> used to ridicule him
on account of his tergiversations, holding up unripe dates before him in the
public street, and charging him with vile conduct in connexion with a married
woman. The blessed Dioscorus cursed this man, asying, &quot;As God is true,
Cyrus will die a layman.&quot; And so, indeed, it happened to him, as is written
below.</p>
<p>But the king, when he heard about John, was very indignant, because the
latter had belied his sworn promises, and obtained the bishopric for himself.</p>
<p>But there were in Constantinople at that time some chosen monks who were
pleading for Peter. And they showed him, by written documents respecting them,
the sad afflictions which, time after time, had occurred in Alexandria, and in
Egypt, and in the other adjacent districts, on account of the Synod, And the
king acceded to their request, and he issued an order that John should be
ejected from the see as a liar, and that Peter <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i>
</i>should be restored to the Church, upon the condition of his subscribing to
the Henotikon which Zeno wrote and sent there, and to Egypt, and to Pentapolis,
and of his receiving and holding communion with all the other bishops who would
agree to the Henotikon ; and, moreover, with those in Alexandria called
Proterians, as many of them as would confess that they agreed to the doctrines
of the Henotikon, which indeed was framed by the counsel of Acacius the bishop,
and was sent to Alexandria in the charge of Pergamius, the newly-appointed
prefect there in the room of Theognostus.</p>
<p>This Pergamius,<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> upon his arrival at the city,
managed the matter prudently. For having discovered that John had escaped by
flight, he sought out Peter, and informed him of the king's order. And he showed
him the Henotikon, saying, &quot;You must, after having carefully studied it,
subscribe and agree to it; and further, you must receive the bishops and the
other members of the Proterian party without any animosity whatsoever, if only
they agree to all that the king has laid down in the same Henotikon.&quot;</p>
<p>And Peter, having considered the contents of this document, found that its
provisions were framed faithfully and with <A NAME="p119"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|119</SPAN></A>
all righteousness. But he hesitated somewhat, because there was no clear and
express anathema of the Synod and the Tome in it, and consequently he feared
that it might prove a stumbling-block to the people. However, he decided to
accept it, inasmuch as it proclaimed the definition of the faith laid down by
the three hundred and eighteen ; and it confessed the truth of the one hundred
and fifty bishops; and it also agreed to the twelve Heads of Cyril; and it
anathematised Nestorius and Eutyches ; and it also confessed that the body of
Christ, derived from the Virgin, was of the same nature as our body. Accordingly
he subscribed to it. And he also promised that, if the others would repent and
accept all the provisions of the Henotikon, and persuade the people to that
effect, he would receive them into communion with himself from all orders.</p>
<p>Then the prefect, and the duke, and the chief men, and the clergy, and the
monks, and the sisters, and the believing people assembled together at the place
where he was ; and they set him upon a chariot, and with pomp and praise as one
who kept the true faith, and doing homage before him, they brought him to the
great church. And Pergamius urged him to receive the other members of the
Proterian party, But he first declared to the people the interpretation of the
meaning of the Henotikon, and explained it, saying, &quot;It is well and
faithfully written, inasmuch as it accepts the twelve Heads of Cyril, and it
anathematises Nestorius and Eutyches, and it confesses the body of Christ,
derived from the Virgin, to be of the same nature as our body, and that the
sufferings which He endured in the flesh, and the miracles which He wrought,
belong to the same God Christ. And this document further cancels and condemns
the whole doctrine of Chalcedon and the Tome, because Dioscorus and Timothy the
Great also thought and expounded similarly.&quot;</p>
<p>And he delivered a further address to the people, to the following effect:
&quot;It is right for all of us, men, women, and children, to offer with the
open mouth of thanksgiving, prayer, <A NAME="p120"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|120</SPAN></A>
and supplication to our Lord and God, on behalf of the faithful reign of the
victorious King Zeno, whose noble actions and' virtuous morals are urging the
prudent in every place to this. For when our fathers, the chaste monks,
presented a petition to him concerning the reformation of the faith, and
informed him of the occurrences here, and of the tumults from which our people
had suffered time after time; then he wept, and he looked up to heaven, and
called God to help him, and to put it into his heart to command whatever would
be in conformity with the divine will, and would conduce to the welfare of men
and the unity of the people, by exerting himself to abolish the stumbling-blocks
which were in all the Churches, on account of all the rash innovations and
additions which were made at Chalcedon.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;And now, beloved children, we have the light of the true faith of the
holy fathers in this written statement of his Orthodoxy, which will now be read
aloud in your presence, and heard by your ears. For by confessing herein the
true faith, and accepting the twelve Heads of the blessed Cyril, and
anathematising Nestorius and Eutyches, and proclaiming that God the Word, Who
became incarnate, is one nature, sufferings and miracles; by all this he rejects
the whole teaching of the <i>Diphysites. </i>For their doctrine and that of the
Tome is quite the opposite of this; and against them our holy fathers, Dioscorus
and Timothy, true witnesses of Christ, earnestly contended.</p>
<p>&quot;But pray for him, that the Lord may keep him in the true proportion of
his love and faith. For we trust, by the mercy of Christ our God, that when your
praises and prayers are heard, we shall not fail to obtain any of those other
petitions which we are rightly asking of Him ; but that He may freely receive
your supplication and grant your requests.&quot;<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;Hear this honourable document, the Henotikon, which <A NAME="p121"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|121</SPAN></A>
he faithfully ordained, and which will now be read in your presence.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VIII</b></p>
<p align="center">THE EIGHTH CHAPTER COMES NEXT, CONTAINING THE HENOTIKON OF
ZENO</p>
<p>&quot;Imperial<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> Caesar, Zeno the king,
believing, victorious, triumphant, mighty, ever-worshipful, Augustus, to the
bishops and the people in Alexandria, and in Egypt, and in Libya, and also in
Pentapolis. Since we know that the origin and stability and invincible might<i> </i>of
our empire is the only right and true faith, which, by Divine Inspiration the
three hundred and eighteen holy fathers in Council at Nicea declared, and which
in like manner the one hundred and fifty holy fathers gathered at
Constantinople, attested: We, by night and by day, employ constant prayers, and
diligence, and enactments, that thereby the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church
in every place, which is the incorruptible and imperishable mother of the
sceptre of our kingdom, may be increased. That thus the believing people, being
kept in godly peace and concord, may offer up, in conjunction with the pious and
holy bishops, and the God-fearing clergy, and the archimandrites and monks,
acceptable prayers on behalf of our empire. For if the great God and our Saviour
Jesus Christ, Who became incarnate from Mary the holy Virgin and <i>Theotokos, </i>shall
approve and readily receive our unanimous praise and service, the race of
enemies shall be destroyed and obliterated ; and all men will bow the neck to
our sway, which is next to that of God ; and then peace, and its consequent
blessings, and genial temperature, and abundance of fruits, and all those things
which are adapted for man's good, shall be liberally granted. This unblemished
faith, then, being thus the preserver of ourselves and of the Roman affairs,
petitions have been presented to us <A NAME="p122"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|122</SPAN></A>
by God-loving archimandrites and other hermits entreating us with tears that
there may be unity to the Holy Churches ; and that the limbs may be joined
together which the haters of good have for a long time been striving to
separate; because they knew that when one makes war with the whole and perfect
body of the Church he is defeated.</p>
<p>&quot;For it has happened that of the generations without number which Time,
during these many years of life, has removed ; some, deprived of the Laver of
Regeneration, have passed away; and others, without participation in the divine
Communion, have been carried off by the inevitable journey of mankind. And they
have been wasted by myriads of murders; and through the profuse blood-shedding,
not the earth alone, but even the very air itself has been defiled. Who would
not pray that this state of things may be exchanged for a good one ? For which
reason, then, we desired you to know that both we and the holy Churches of the
orthodox everywhere, and the God-loving priests who rule them, neither hold, nor
have held, nor know any man holding, any other symbol, or doctrine, or seal of
the faith, or creed, than that which we have mentioned above, the holy symbol of
the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers, which was also attested by the one
hundred and fifty holy fathers who met in Council here. And if there be any man
holding such, we account him an alien. For, as we have already said, we are
confident that this only preserves our kingdom; and also all people who are
counted worthy of life-giving Baptism are baptized upon the simple reception of
this creed alone. And, moreover, all the holy fathers, who met in Council at
Ephesus, and deposed the wicked Nestorius and all his successors in doctrine,
followed the same faith.</p>
<p>&quot;This Nestorius, together with Eutyches, inasmuch as they held doctrines
contrary to what have been here declared, we anathematise. And we also receive
the twelve Heads delivered by the ever-memorable. God-loving Cyril, formerly
archbishop of the Catholic Church of Alexandria. But we confess that the
only-begotten Son of God, Himself God, <A NAME="p123"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|123</SPAN></A>
our Lord Jesus Christ, Who truly became man; He Who is of the same nature with
the Father in the Godhead ; He Who is also of the same nature with us in the
manhood; He Who came down and assumed flesh, through the Holy Ghost, and from
Mary the Virgin and <i>Theotokos,— </i>is <i>one </i>Son and not <i>two. </i>For
we affirm that the miracles which He wrought, and the sufferings which He freely
endured in the flesh, belong to one Son of God alone. Moreover, we altogether
reject those who either divide or confound, or introduce the <i>phantasy. </i>For
the true and sinless Incarnation from the <i>Theotokos </i>did not cause the
addition of a Son. For the Trinity remained even though God the Word, Who is one
of the Trinity, became incarnate.</p>
<p>&quot;Since, then, you know that both the Holy Orthodox Churches everywhere
and the God-loving priests who rule them, and our own Royalty, neither have
received nor do receive any other symbol or definition of the faith than the
holy doctrine which has been declared above; be united together without
doubting. For we have written this, not to make any innovation in the faith, but
to assure you.</p>
<p>&quot;And here we anathematise all who have held, or hold, now or at any
time, whether in Chalcedon or in any other Synod whatsoever, any different
belief; but chiefly those already mentioned, Nestorius and Eutyches and all
their followers in the doctrine.</p>
<p>&quot;Be joined, then, to your spiritual mother, the Church, and delight in
her, together with us, in divine fellowship, according to that one definition of
the faith alone which was framed by the holy fathers, as we have declared above.
For our all-holy mother, the Church, longs for you, that she may embrace you as
beloved children. And, for a considerable time, she has been eager to hear your
sweet<i> </i>voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Hasten, therefore! For by so doing you will attract to yourselves the
goodwill of our God and Saviour Christ; and you will also be commended by our
own Royalty.&quot; <A NAME="p124"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|124</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IX</b></p>
<p align="center">THE NINTH CHAPTER OF THIS FIFTH BOOK TELLS ABOUT THE
SEPARATISTS</p>
<p>These matters having been thus transacted, some of the more ardent spirits
were very indignant; because in the king's document, the Henotikon, there was no
express anathema of the additions imposed at Chalcedon. However, they all
remained in communion with Peter because he defended himself before them ; and
especially as he said, &quot;The king will not fail us in any of the requests
that we shall make to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the rest of the Proterians, seeing how matters were, went off to a
suburb of the city, called Canopus, and they kept crying out evil words.
However, they were feeble and few, and at their head were some readers, and
Cyrus the presbyter, concerning whom we have already stated that he was at one
time a follower of Dioscorus, but he afterwards deserted him. Pergamius, hearing
of this secession, sent for Cyrus to have a conversation with him. And the
latter agreed to do what he was asked. So when he returned to them, he pleaded
earnestly with his companions at Canopus, saying, &quot;It is right for us to
join in fellowship with the others, and to obey the king's command.&quot; But
the zealous and believing priests who were on Peter's side, hearing about it,
were greatly distressed. And they refused to hold communion with Cyrus. And
although they received a large number of his associates upon their subscribing
to the Henotikon, and anathematising everyone who thought differently from what
was in it; yet they refused Cyrus himself. And even when he subscribed they
would not have him. For they said to <A NAME="p125"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|125</SPAN></A>
Pergamius that the very sight of him would be enough to bring his deeds into the
remembrance of the people, and to put a stumbling-block in the way of many. So
Cyrus remained a layman ; and thus he died, according to the curse of the holy
Dioscorus.</p>
<p>Then they were all associated in fellowship with Peter and Peter the Iberian,
wonderfully celebrated, and the able<i><sup> </sup></i>monk Isaiah, and the
other Palestinians, certain blessed monks of the monasteries of Romanus and
Theodore.</p>
<p>And Peter, the bishop of Alexandria, sent Paul, surnamed Arcadius, to the
king about certain matters of one kind and another that required correction.</p>
<p>But John,<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> who had been bishop, went off to
Rome; and there, with tears, he told Simplicius the patriarch what had befallen
him ; alleging that he continued in danger for the sake of the Synod and the
Tome. Whereupon the king, hearing of it, wrote a letter and sent it to the same
Simplicius by the hand of Uranius the tax-gatherer, in which he set forth to him
all the wickedness and lying treachery of John, and declared that by his own
command Peter had been appointed bishop there in Alexandria, with the object of
bringing the people into one communion.</p>
<p>But Calandion <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A><i> </i>of Antioch, having heard
about the Alexandrian affairs, was much distressed, and wrote letters to
Acacius, and to Zeno the king, and to Simplicius of Rome, in which he called
Peter a false teacher,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> and he praised the Tome
and the Synod. But he was closely attached to Nestorius, because in his letter
he called Cyril a <i>fool</i>.<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></p>
<p>However, as he took the side of Julius, and Leontius, and Euprepius, in the
rebellion which they eventually raised against Zeno the king in the East, he was
ejected from his place. And by the king's commands, Peter, who had once and <A NAME="p126"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|126</SPAN></A>
twice contended and suffered on behalf of the true faith, was restored to his
see. And the people of Antioch received him with great pomp and glory as Simon
Peter. Then he convened the Synod of his province, and he healed and closed the
divisions, and set matters right. The Synod also, which he convened, drew up a
letter of fellowship in canonical fashion, and sent it to Peter of Alexandria.
It was to the following effect:—</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER X</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE TENTH CHAPTER OF THIS FIFTH BOOK TELLS ABOUT THE SYNODICAL LETTER,
  WHICH WAS SENT TO PETER OF ALEXANDRIA BY THE COUNCIL THAT WAS CONVENED AT
  ANTIOCH, IN THE DAYS WHEN PETER WAS BISHOP THERE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;To our Father, the God-loving, holy, Archbishop Peter, from the Synod
now convened at Antioch.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as Joshua the son of Nun, the leader of the host,<sup> </sup>and
invested with the mysteries of Jesus Christ our God, showed care and solicitude
for the possession and rights of the tribes of Reuben, and Gad, and Manasseh ;
when, according to the command of Moses, who delivered to him the leadership,
they in conjunction with their brethren crossed the Jordan armed, and entered
the land of promise to possess it ; and continued to help in the war until God
caused their brethren, like themselves, to rest in peace there: in like manner
we judge it to be the endeavour of thine Excellency, O bishop, that we also,
being the bishops from Arabia and Libanus of Phoenice, and Syria Secunda, and
Euphratesia, and Cilicia, should come to Antioch armed, until our Eastern
brethren shall possess the inheritance of their Churches from God. But how,
after the troubles and conflicts that have befallen us, <A NAME="p127"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|127</SPAN></A>
we are earnestly desirous of peace; and how, by the letters of the indulgent
king, we have been now called to meet at Antioch ; thy son the beloved and
illustrious Uranius the tax-gatherer will tell thee. For he, in the execution of
the king's will and command, communicated and showed to us the letter sent by
him to thy Holiness, and to the chaste monks, and to the believing people.</p>
<p>&quot;But we, having met together and been received with the rights of divine
love by our believing father Peter the patriarch, who showed us kindness and
meekness with prudence, were in concord with him in all matters and he with us ;
and we joined in fellowship one with the other in spiritual ministration. We
were honoured also by the citizens, who met and welcomed him with joy and
gladness, and with ministering praise; and extolled him as Peter Kepho our
leader the Apostle. And, moreover, we heard about the transactions in the royal
city, how, from the jurisdiction of the holy Archbishop Acacius, they had met
together by the king's command ; and about their unity with him and with one
another; and how he wrote to thy Blessedness, showing and explaining the will of
the believing king; and that the contents of his excellent document the
Henotikon were in complete accord with the faith of the holy fathers of Nicea;
in which also the one hundred and fifty assembled in the royal city concurred ;
and which was confirmed by the Council of Ephesus in the days of Celestine and
Cyril ; the latter of whom also in the twelve Heads exposed and anathematised
all the false doctrine of Nestorius and Eutyches, and the other heresies.</p>
<p>&quot;These things, indeed, brought the Egyptians<i> </i>into full accord
with the Easterns, or rather, we should say, with all who in every place are
devoted to peace, and who love unity and the true faith.</p>
<p>&quot;And we believe and are confident that the diligence and prayers of Thy
Holiness have tended to bring about this happy result for the believing people
everywhere, by the will of our Lord and Brother Jesus Christ, Whom we beseech to
<A NAME="p128"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|128</SPAN></A> preserve for us the life of thy
Chastity, prospering in all virtue, and rejoicing in the Lord at what was done
here upon the return of thine honourable brother our chaste father, through the
diligence of this thy son Uranius, whom we commend to thy godly love, that thou
mayest write and send thanks to the believing king. For he is indeed serving him
with all his might, by carrying out his command, and earnestly endeavouring to
promote the unity of the Churches of Christ, and to impart peace to His beloved
sons.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER XI</b></p>
<p align="center">THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER CONTAINS THE LETTER OF ACACIUS OF
CONSTANTINOPLE TO PETER OF ALEXANDRIA<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A></p>
<p>Acacius, indeed, desisting from his former mind, which was in favour of the
Synod, and connecting himself in loving agreement with the principles of the
Henotikon, also wrote a letter to Peter of Alexandria in the following terms:—</p>
<p>&quot;To our pious and God-loving fellow-minister and brother Peter, Acacius
sends greeting. The very name of peace, indeed, is delightful ; but its effect
is very sweet. For when, in accordance with the unity and the faith of the
Church, it is perfected, it imparts the more abundant grace to the prudent, and
works in them joy, for it announces great things.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we were blest with such joy as this in the congregations of our own
city, when reports reached us respecting thy faith, which troubled us. And,
moreover, they produced agitation and distress among many of the chaste monks
here, and the people, and our excellent clergy. However, thine honoured letter,
having been conveyed and delivered to us and to the illustrious chiefs here,
exposed the entire falsehood of the rumour respecting thee, and rolled away the
darkness of the cloud, and displayed the brilliancy and the purity of thy godly
virtues. So that it is now time for us to <A NAME="p129"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|129</SPAN></A>
say, 'Glory to God in the highest.' For it is producing and manifesting the
peace, which is in the land of our faith, and the goodwill amongst the men of
our great God and Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ. And, therefore, that glory of
which the angels from heaven in their companies were the first to sing in the
ears of the shepherds over the earth, at Bethlehem, that same glory the
shepherds and leaders of the sheep, His people, being joined together hand in
hand in their union and concord, now ascribe in their song of praise to our Lord
God, Who is the true Head and Shepherd of the flock.</p>
<p>&quot;But also the triumphant Star of Christ from the East is now the
believing and God-fearing king.</p>
<p>&quot;And just as that star guided those of old to Christ our God, that they
might repair to the cave and offer gifts for the honour of His worship ; so he
also now has manifested and caused to shine forth the splendour of the true
faith to the whole cave of his dominion. And he has also taken down the middle
wall of partition that divided<i> </i>and cleft asunder the unity of the members
of the holy Church; thereby making them grow into a perfect man of complete
stature. So that he has displayed the body in one Person and figure, and he has
made of two one. For we understand also from the thankful letter of thy Holiness
that he too like David, in prophesying and in reigning, has now slain Goliath in
the field<i> </i>with the Cross alone ; and having smitten the evil one as with
a sling, he has overthrown and destroyed<sup> </sup>him by his faithful letter
which he wrote ; and by the true sword of the Spirit which he displayed, he has
cut off and taken away those heresies and stumbling-blocks which are the very
heads of the Dragon ; whom also having overthrown, he has thrust into outer
darkness, and has bound and imprisoned him in the lower parts of the earth.</p>
<p>&quot;Accordingly Jerusalem above, the mother of the firstborn, shall
rejoice, and also in her daughters the Churches she shall exult and sing, giving
praise to God. with prayer for <A NAME="p130"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|130</SPAN></A> the
triumph of the king, and saying, 'Glory be to the Most High Lord, Who is greatly
to be praised.' For we also were amazed at the triumph of God, when we learned
from thy letter that the Henotikon, which in our own presence was despatched to
thy Holiness by the hands of Pergamius, had reached thee, and that thou hast
agreed to it. And we exult in thy faith, and we pray that the Lord may preserve<i><sup>
</sup></i>for us the life of this believing king who has united us to the truth.
And now I, and those who are with me, sending greetings to thy Chastity, and to
the excellent clergy, and to the chaste monks, and to the believing people, have
written this letter of reply.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And now that we have received thine Affection's reply, our people join
with this prophet in crying aloud, 'Lift <A NAME="p131"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|131</SPAN></A>
up thine eyes round about thee, and behold thy children gathering together unto
thee.'<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> For which blessing, as is right, we exult;
and we greet thy Holiness in the Lord. And, singing psalms with the prophet
David, we say, 'May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children ;
blessed are ye of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.'<sup><A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
</sup>I and those who are with me, send our best respects in the Lord also to
the priests who are with thy Chastity, and to the believing people, and to the
pious monks.&quot;</p>
