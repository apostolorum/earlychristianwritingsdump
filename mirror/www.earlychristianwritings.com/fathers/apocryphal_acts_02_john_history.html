<p align=center>THE  HISTORY OF<br>
JOHN, THE  
SON   OF ZEBEDEE<br>
THE APOSTLE AND
EVANGELIST.</p>

<p align=center>———————</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The history of John, the son of
Zebedee, who lay upon the breast of our Lord Jesus at the supper, and said,
&quot;Lord, who betrayeth Thee?&quot; This
history was composed by Eusebius of Cæsarea concerning S. John, who found it in
a Greek book, and it was translated into
Syriac, when he had learned concerning his way of life and his birth
and his dwelling in the city of Ephesus, after the ascension of our Lord to Heaven.
<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> </p>

</blockquote>
<p>After the ascension of our
Lord  to Heaven, when the days of Pentecost
were fulfilled, and the Paraclete had come to the upper chamber, and all
the Apostles were filled with the Spirit of
holiness, and were speaking each one of them with a separate tongue <i> </i>— then after (some) days there
was the wish to each one of them  being full of the Spirit of holiness, that
they should go forth to <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> proclaim and preach the truth of the Only-(begotten),
the Word God,  for the great hearing of the faith, to all nations that are
under the heavens. After, then, that Simon Peter had finished his words, they
said  all of them one to another: &quot; Now that our Lord Jesus has fulfilled
all things that are necessary for our feeble race, it is necessary for us too
that we should do with diligence all that He commanded us. For  He said to us,
when He was going up unto Heaven from beside us, as He was blessing us: 'Go
forth, teach, and baptize in the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit
of holiness ; every one that believes and is baptized shall live.'  For us too,
then, my brethren, it is necessary to toil and labour throughout the whole
world, and to go about in the countries, and to preach, and to teach all those
who, in the worshipping of idols and with libations to devils, have kneeled
before images, and fallen down (and) worshipped  the accursed demons, the
children of the left hand;  and let us bestow our labour, and let light shine
in the ear  which the evil one has blinded, and let the father of lying be
crushed beneath the feet of us all.&quot;</p>

<p>When these words had been
spoken among the blessed assembly of the Apostleship, they parted from one
another in the body, each of them being full of the Spirit of holiness, who
proceeded from the Father and came unto them, as the beloved Son had promised
them.&nbsp; <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A></p>

<p>Each of them then went to such
country and region as he was charged by the grace (of God). And it happened
that when this holy virgin, namely John, the son of Zebedee, went forth, the
grace (of God) accompanied him,  through the Spirit    of holiness,  that it
might lead him to the country of the Ephesians, where the head and power of
idolatry was dominant. And when he had parted and gone forth from Jerusalem, he
set his face to go to Ephesus. And on the third day after he had set out to
proceed upon the journey, he took a cross of wood, and put it up towards the
east, and kneeled, and was praying and saying: &quot; Lord Jesus, now that Thy
promise is fulfilled, and we have all  received of Thy fullness, grant to the
garland of Thy disciples, that wherever, Lord, they make mention of Thy birth
from the Virgin, and Thy abiding among men, and Thy passion on the Cross, and
Thy death and Thy entering within the grave, and Thy resurrection on the third
day, and Thy ascension unto Thy Father to Heaven, the feeble race of mankind 
may be strengthened, which in its infancy the evil one deceived, and took
captive, and led them  astray to worship idols, and sacrifice to devils, and bow down to senseless stones. Yea, Lord ! hear
and answer me. Let the devils and the legions of Satan wail, wherever
one of us proclaims Thy Gospel; and let the whole assembly of the Apostleship
be enriched with the sound of Thy praise thundering in every place. <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>
Let the demons tremble at the
voices that thunder  in the midst of Thy Church; and remember Thy Church, which
Thou hast bought with Thy precious blood, which Thy Father hath given that
through Her all creation might be atoned for. Thou,  Lord, art Light of Light;
and because it seemed good unto Thee, in the love of Thy Father, Thou didst
walk on earth, and didst humble Thy majesty, that Thou mightest raise us up from
the degradation into which the slayer of man had cast us down through his envy.
And Thou  hast said, and we have heard with our ears of flesh, 'I and My
Father are one,'  and <i> </i>'he that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father;' <sup> </sup>and in this confidence, Lord, my youth beseeches
Thee to hear my prayer. For I too trust that I have received the Spirit
of holiness with my companions, and of it, lo, have obtained and am full. And
whatsoever I ask of Thy Father in Thy name, He will give to me;  and nothing
shall be too difficult for one of those who believe in Thee,  but whatsoever
they ask, they shall receive. <sup> </sup>Yea, Lord! grant me that I may abide
in Thy Gospel, and may prosper in all the truth; because I speak the truth,
that Thou art from the beginning, the Word that proceeded from the Father; and
Thou didst appear to the world in the body
(derived) from Adam, from the Virgin Mary,  who was preserved in her
virginity; and there was not (a time) when the, Father was without Thee, <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>
or
Thou without Him ; and Thou before us hast laid the foundations of the earth;
and Thy mercy made Thee bow, and Thou didst enter by the ear of the Virgin, and
didst dwell in her nine months, and didst come forth from her, and wast in the
world, in contempt and littleness; and Thou didst choose us from the world,
that the world might live through our preaching. Now then, Lord, I will go  to
that place to which Thy heavenly grace hath made me look; and may they be
turned,  and become (my) disciples, and be baptized in Thy name and in the name
of the Father who sent Thee, and receive Thy Spirit of holiness, which has
proceeded from Thy Father, and, lo, dwells in us; and may the graven images of
error be destroyed ; and do Thou build for Thyself in the city of priests
churches for Thy glorification, and, in place of the house of altars for the
libations of demons, altars for Thy dwelling-places; and may these,
who through our means are to take the road and paths  to turn unto Thee, make
praise ascend unto Thee at all times. Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>And when S. John had finished
his prayer, our Lord Jesus spake with him. from heaven, and said unto him:
&quot; My peace I have given unto thee  and have not left thee bereaved. Lo, I
am with you  unto the end of the world.  Be not afraid, son of Zebedee! Go and
preach, and take no heed what thou shalt say or what <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A>
thou shalt speak.  But when thou hast converted this city and this country from error, another band too
of the disciples, which is labouring
in the Gospel, is destined to come and see all that I shall do by thy
hands. Go, and tarry not.&quot;</p>

<p>And when
He had done speaking with him, John arose, and was going on the way confidently,
rejoicing in the joy of the Spirit of
holiness.  He was clothed then after the fashion of the raiment of Palestine,
and was walking barefooted, and was going along and preaching  in the
cities and in the villages concerning our Lord Jesus the Messiah, forty-eight
days. Some were saying, &quot;He is a madman;&quot; and others were saying,
&quot; No; <i> </i>let him alone; for this (man) has come from a far country,
and knows not our mighty gods. But when he
has entered in and learned, then he will love them and sacrifice unto them.&quot; But many people of
Asia  heard him gladly, and believed, and thought his preaching true; and he baptized of them in three days about two hundred
souls, and made them lay hold on the path of truth.</p>

<p>Then S.
John went forth and journeyed to come to the city of the
priesthood. And his sustenance was, from the ninth to the ninth hour once, when he
had finished his prayer, bread and herbs
with a mess of boiled lentils, which he bought for himself  (as he went) from
town to town, eating, and drinking water only. And he kept <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A>
himself 
aloof,  that  he might not associate  with  the heathens.</p>

<p>This great
and chosen (man), then—as we have found in the books, which are written on
paper, in the archives of Nero, the wicked emperor—S. John, then, came and arrived at the
city of Ephesus; and he lifted up his eyes and
saw, and, lo, a smoke was going up from the midst of the city of Ephesus, for it was a festival of the
heathens, and they were sacrificing
to the devils. And he stood still and
was astonished, saying: &quot;What is this conflagration, which, lo, veils the
sun so that it does not shine upon the buildings of the city?&quot; And with
terror taking hold on him, he came and reached the southern gate, and
lifted up his eyes and saw; and lo, the image of the idol Artemis was standing
over the gate, painted by them with paints, with gold laid upon her lips, and a
veil of fine linen hanging over her face, and a lamp burning before her. And
when S. John looked and saw her, he contemplated her<sub>;</sub> and sighed,
and wept over the city; and he left (the spot), and departed thence to another gate,  and saw there  the same thing; and  he went
round and saw thus at all the gates.  And at last he came near to the
eastern (gate),  and said to an old woman, who was standing and worshipping her
— he spoke and said to her  in the language of the country: &quot;Woman, I see
thee, that thou art a woman advanced in years; what is this image that thou art
worshipping?&quot; <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She then said to him:
&quot;Dost thou not know, my son, what thou seest?  This is our lady, and her
image descended from heaven, and she nourishes all flesh.&quot; He then, a
youth in his body, but exalted above the whole garland of his brethren, the
holy virgin John, broke out into anger with her and said: &quot;Hold thy peace,
old woman! for thy mind has become enfeebled
by sacrifices of unclean things.  Talk not to me of the daughter of
Satan.&quot; But she stooped down, and filled her fists with dust and gravel,
and scattered it in his eyes;  and he left (her) and departed thence. And he
went a little (way) off, and knelt down, and was praying and supplicating. And
he placed his face between his knees from the sixth hour to the ninth, and was
weeping, groaning and saying: &quot;Lord God, strong and mighty, longsuffering
and abounding in grace, Thou art He who from the first didst show Thy
longsuffering, for a hundred years, on those (who were) called to repentance of
the generation of Noah; but they did not repent, until the flood came and swept
away that whole generation. And Thou art He who didst send Thy only-(begotten
and) dear Son, that the world might have life through Him; <sup> </sup>and He
came and did good deeds like Thee, because He proceeded from Thee. And Thou art
He who, when the people of Israel worshipped the calf, didst find out a reason
and didst say to Moses,   'Suffer me to destroy this people,' since it did not
honour Thee;  for Thou didst wish that it should pray to Thee, because Thou&nbsp;
<A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A> takest great pleasure in the life of men. So also
Thy dear Son our Lord Jesus the Messiah, when the Jews took Him to slay
Him, prayed and said, 'Forgive them, for they know not what they do.'   This
mercy, then, which is eternally in Thee, is also found in Thy Son, for Ye are
one. Turn, Lord! the heart of these erring ones, who, lo, are shouting and
crying out before devils. Thou didst come and slay the evil one; let not his
head be lifted up <sup> </sup>in the assembly of this city; let not be heard
the sound of the roaring  of the falsehood
of the devils.   Thou didst die once, and didst raise us to life with
Thyself. Dash down Satan, for, lo, he has cast down and brought low the image,
that was created in Thy likeness, before the legions
of his demons. Let the doomed images be brought into contempt, not of
this place only, but  of every region through which our preaching runs. Yea,
Lord! Thou hast  taught  us that we should walk in the world humbly and
lowlily.<sup> </sup> Hear the prayer of Thy servant John, and
let me enter this city, bearing the sign of Thy Cross; and direct my path to
the right hand; and where Thou pleasest, there let be found for me a place in
which I can earn my living as a hireling, until, Lord, this city follows
(Thee) and confesses Thy  name.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had entered by the
gate of Ephesus, he looked  to   the right hand, and saw there a bath, which
was built for the washing of the body. And he turned <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A>
aside thither, and lo,
(there was) the man who kept the bath, whose name was Secundus. And S. John
spake with him, and said to him in the language of the country: &quot;To thee I
say, O man! art thou perchance willing that a stranger should work with
thee?&quot; And Secundus, the keeper of the bath, said to him: &quot;How much
dost thou require of me by the day ?&quot; But S. John said to him : &quot;
Whatever thou art willing to give, give.&quot; And he fixed for him a hundred <i>sham&#363;n&#275; </i>by the day, and
accepted him (as a servant); and he let  him  come  in to work at his trade with him, and he fetched  faggots  for those who kindled
the bath; and he was with him forty days, receiving his wages day by day.</p>

<p>And Secundus the bath-keeper
answered and said to the holy man: &quot;I wish to know what thou dost with thy
wages; for, lo, all these days thou hast not bought for thyself either shoe or
coat. Tell me, if it be enough; and if not, deposit thy wages in my hands, and
I will buy for thee whatsoever thou requirest; for  thou art a stranger, and
hast no kindred here.&quot; But S. John said to Secundus the bath-keeper:
&quot;I have a Master, and He has ordered me
and the disciples my fellows, that none (of us) should possess gold or
silver or brass in a purse, or two coats;  and I cannot despise his command, otherwise He would be wroth with me.&quot;
Secundus says to him: &quot; Who is this master of <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>
thine? and what is his name?
It is fitting <i> </i>that thou shouldst let me know, lest he come and assail
me, and, it he be a hard man, give me up (to the magistrates) and put me to
great losses; for it is an odious thing, and abominable in the eye of the law, for a man to accept (one as) a servant
without his master's consent.&quot; And S. John answered and said to Secundus
the bath-keeper: &quot;Fear not, Secundus, thou son of free parents! for my
Master will not be angry with thee, because He sent me and directed me to
thee.&quot; Secundus says: &quot;But why didst thou not tell me until to-day
that thou wast a slave and hadst a master?&quot; And S. John said to him:
&quot;My Master is in Heaven, and all that He wills, He does, on earth and in
the seas and in all the deeps; and at His beck everything was made, which is visible
and which is invisible; and He established all created things, and made the
lights in the firmament of heaven; and then He made man in His image. And when
Satan came with his envy, and counselled  Eve,  and she hearkened to his words
and made Adam sin and he transgressed His
command, they went forth from Paradise,
and became fugitives, and tilled the ground, and multiplied and increased and
filled the earth. And Satan went about and plotted,
and filled all mankind with the love of idols and (made them) sacrifice
to devils, and bow down to the work of their hands, and caused them to forget <A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A>
the Creator, and to reverence those who are not gods. But  the good Lord had
patience with them until (the time of) his lover Noah; and He made him a
preacher for Him for a hundred years, whilst he was making for himself the ark,
that they might see and repent and be turned away from the wickedness of their
deeds. And when they despised our Creator, His wrath went up, and He sent the
waters of the flood and swept them all away. And after the waters of the flood
were restrained, the world was established through Noah, and the generations
came in succession, and the world was populated at the beck of the Creator; and
the minds of men were inclined to do evil and wickedness, and to turn from the
living God; but the mercy of the Creator of men was made manifest, and He had
compassion upon all the degradation of this feeble race of ours, and He sent
the prophets to proclaim His truth, but they did not choose to hear them, and
some they beat and some they stoned. But in this time, which is the last, the
one beloved Son, His only-(begotten), who was to Him from the time that He
was,—Him He sent, and He entered by the ear of the woman, and dwelt in her nine
months, without quitting Him who sent Him; and the heights and depths were full
of Him, and were ruled by Him by the will of His Father. And when the nine
months were fulfilled, He came forth from the woman, the Word that became
flesh, and her virginity remained immaculate for ever. And He grew up in the
body among men, and walked among men as a man, He the Word God, apart from sin. <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>And He grew up to the full age
of thirty years, and chose for Himself disciples, and they clave unto Him
whilst he sojourned  in the desert.    And He made wine out of water at Cana 
at the feast ; and bread was wanting, and he
satisfied four thousand  men, besides women and children, with five
loaves of barleymeal, and they ate and left  (some)   over, and  carried  and 
conveyed  to  their homes as much as they were able.    And again, another
time, He satisfied thousands in the desert, after He had healed their lame and
sick, and opened (the eyes of) the blind, and some of them are abiding until
now; and He made the deaf hear, and cleansed the lepers, and raised the
daughter of Jairus, the chief of the synagogue, after she  was  dead, and, 
lo,  she abideth, with her father, in Decapolis, and if thou choosest to go,
thou mayest learn (it) from her. And (He
delivered from death)  the son of the widow of Nain, as they were going
to bury him, and Lazarus, after they had laid him in the grave four days. Many
such things mayest thou hear, if thou wilt give me thine ear, and believe, and
become His servant, Secundus. And after thirty-two years, after the thirty-third
had commenced, the people of the Jews hated Him and detested His  good works, 
as they had rejected His Father and made for themselves a calf at Horeb. And
they delivered Him unto Pilate the h&#283;gemon, and scourged Him, and stripped
Him of His garments, and mocked Him, and spat in His face, and wove <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>
a crown of
thorns, and placed it on His head, and crucified Him upon the tree, and gave Him
vinegar and gall to drink, and smote Him with a spear in His side  and He cried
out with a loud voice on the Cross, ('My Father, forgive them'). <sup> </sup>And
when the preaching of the prophets was
accomplished, the sun  was darkened from the sixth  to  the  ninth hour,
and there was darkness over the whole earth on the Friday; and the veil of the
temple was rent; and the boulders <sup> </sup>and rocks, which blocked up the entrances of the tombs around
Jerusalem, were split, and the dead came forth and entered into the
city, crying out aloud;  and they came and worshipped Him as He hung on the
tree, and many of them are (still) alive.
And they took Him down from the tree, and a man full of the truth,
Joseph the councillor, wrapped Him in a swathe of linen, <i> </i>and laid Him
in the tomb ; and on the third day He rose from the grave, and we saw Him, and
He spake with us, and we ate bread with Him  and we felt Him, and believed and
declared (it) true, that He is the &quot;Word which became flesh and dwelt among us.  And He ascended into Heaven, and
is seated at the right hand of His Father, and He has given us power to
give life and blessings to every one who believes in His name. And He said to
us :  'Go forth, <A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A> and teach, and
baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit of holiness ;
everyone who believes and is baptized, shall
live.'  And now I beseech thee, Secundus,— for I have proved thee during
these days, that thou art not a blasphemer,
but art full of good deeds and love
of strangers  — receive what I have spoken before thee, and count me not
a deceiver, but, if thou wilt, come with me to the country of Galilee, and I
will show thee (some) of the dead and the
blind and the hunch­backed and the
palsied and the lepers, whom He cleansed and healed and raised, for they
are alive. But if thou dost not choose to come and (yet) believest, thou art
greater than I, who have seen Him and have been with Him, for thou wilt believe
in Him that He is God who did these things,
and He will convert thee and make thee white and pure from the stench of
unclean sacrifices. Yea, my brother! set my
mind at ease, and thy dwelling shall be blessed, and thou shalt be
recognised before Him in the new
world.&quot;</p>

<p>And Secundus the bath-keeper
was sitting (still), and astonished and wondering at what he was hearing from
John; and he began to say to him: &quot;Wonderful is what thou hast spoken unto
me and verging on marvel ; for even though He be not God and did not descend
from Heaven, it is fitting that He should be believed in and should be called
God, because He came forth from the womb and
did not destroy (His mother's) virginity <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>when He came forth; and it is a
very deplorable thing, if one does not hold it true that He is God, who raised
the dead, and He is the Creator, who made wine out of water; and He has power
over our frame, and because of this He opened and healed and cleansed. This
one, then, is fitting to be called God, and not yon one, to whom, lo, for sixty
years, more or less, I have been paying vows and libations, and she has not
opened the eye of my son which was blind. But now, my son John, let this secret
be kept which we have spoken, and let it not be revealed until the time that
its Lord wishes to reveal it, especially as thou art a stranger, lest it be heard
regarding thee that thou dost not worship Artemis, and they burn thee. Now,
then, I have assented to, and believed,  and hold to be true, all that thou
hast said; and do thou be persuaded by me, and take upon thee the management of
this bath, and let thine eyes be upon the servants, and do thou have control
over the income and over all the outlay.&quot; But John said to him: &quot;It
becometh me not to eat without working;&quot; and Secundus said to him:
&quot;Thy labour is harder than that of him who works.'' Then the holy (man) yielded to him, and took upon
him to receive the incomings of the bath and to give a reckoning from morning to morning.</p>

<p>Secundus, then, was amazed, he
and his household, how much the receipts of the bath increased during these
days, which were twenty-two days (in number); and he used to get up very early,
and go down and speak to <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>the holy (man) and
ask him: &quot;How is it possible to make me thy associate?&quot; But
John said:  &quot;After He has opened thy
son's eye,  that he may be baptized.&quot;</p>

<p>And on the twenty-fifth day,
(when) the time of an hour of the day (was past), a procurator's son, whose
name was  Menelaus, and his father's Tyrannus,  came and constrained the holy
(man) that the bath should be closed and got
ready. But it was not known to the holy (man)  that  any  one  was going
into the bath with him. And the holy (man) gave orders, and the bath was got
ready; and this Menelaus came to bathe, and took with him into the bath a
harlot, and was with her in the bath. And
when he came out from his bath, John arose and said to him: &quot;Hither
come not thou again, because thou hast done a great disgrace to this person of
thine, which is created in the image
of God, in that thou hast gone in with a harlot, and not been ashamed that thou
hast seen her shame and she thine.&quot; And  Menelaus was enraged with the
holy (man) and struck him.    And S. John said to him: &quot;If thou comest
hither, thou shalt not depart hence.&quot;</p>

<p>And after two days, he sent two
of his servants to get ready the bath. And
when the bath was ready, he came to bathe, and brought the former harlot
along with him. But S. John, by the agency of God our Lord, had gone out to look after those who kindled (the bath).
And when he came, he asked: &quot;Why is the door of the bath
closed?&quot; They say unto him: &quot;Menelaus, the <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
procurator's son, is
within.&quot; But when the holy (man) heard that he was within, and that the
harlot was with him, he was grieved, and sighed, and was troubled. And he
waited till both of them came out; and he did not look at them till they had
put on their clothes. And when they were dressed after their bath, he turned
and looked at them, and said to the youth: &quot;To thee I say, may Jesus
rebuke thee, whom the Jews crucified on the tree, and He died, and rose after
three days, and He is God, and He ascended to Heaven, and is at the right hand
of His Father; but thou shalt drop down and die on the spot.&quot; And
straightway the Angel of the Lord smote him, and he died on the spot.  And he
was lying (there), and S. John was sitting beside him; and straightway the
harlot went forth with a great outcry, with her hands placed on her head. And
when they heard it around the bath, they came and saw with fear that the young
man was dead and lying (there), and the holy (man) sitting beside him. And they
looked on his face and perceived that it was Menelaus, the procurator's son;
and lamentation and wailing ran through that whole street. And it was
dinner-time, and his father was seated (at table), and expecting him to come up
and dine with him. And they came in and said to him: &quot;Lo, thy only son is
dead and lying in the bath.&quot;</p>

<p>And
Tyrannus arose in haste, and cast ashes on his head, and rent his garments ; and he made great
haste coming to the bath to his son, and a great multitude with him. And he
came, and went in, and saw his son dead and lying (there), and S. John sitting
beside him; and they <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A> seized hold on John, and laid fetters on his hands and
feet, and thick  collars on his neck. But the father of the youth was crying
with a great outcry; and he commanded, and they stripped John, that they might
see what he had on. And when they had taken off his coat and the worn-out shirt
which he had on, they found on him a cross, which was suspended to his neck,
and it was of wood. And the procurator, the father of the young man, commanded
that they should take it away; and when they stretched out their hands to take
it away, it had four tongues of fire, and they burned the hands of those who
came near it. And the whole multitude cried out: &quot;This man is a wizard;
let this man be kept to-day in custody and be examined, (to see) how
many companions he has.&quot; And the procurator
commanded that S. John should be dragged away till he entered the prison
house, whilst the youth his son was being buried. But S. John cried out,
&quot;The youth is  not dead;&quot; and his father gave orders, and they lifted
him up and turned him over, and he placed  his mouth  against his, and he was
like a stone without sensation. But the holy (man) said, &quot;He is not
dead,&quot; solely that they might see that he was already dead. And the holy
(man) said unto them: &quot;If he be
dead, I will bring him to life.&quot; And whilst they were dragging away S.
John that he might go to prison, Secundus the bath-keeper was standing by and
weeping passionately <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A> with sobs among the
crowd. And S. John was begging of Tyrannus that they might call Secundus
the bath-keeper ; and the procurator ordered, and they laid hold of Secundus
and brought him in  to him.  And Secundus was weeping for John's sake, for he
imagined that John would be put to death; but the father of the youth thought that he was weeping for the youth.
And the holy (man), being bound, answered and said to Secundus:
&quot;Fear not, Secundus! and be not grieved; to-day it is the will of the
Spirit of holiness to make manifest the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>And the crowd was great and
agitated. And S. John begged the procurator to order the crowd to be silent;
and he ordered and the crowd was quiet. And S. John stood up, and cried with a loud voice and said:   &quot;To thee I
say, (thou) youth Menelaus, in the name of Jesus the Messiah,  (who is)  God, whom the Jews crucified and killed in Jerusalem, and He died and was buried and rose
after three days, and, lo, is above in Heaven at the right hand of His
Father,—rise.&quot; And straightway he sprang up and arose; and the whole populace of the city marvelled. And the
youth fell on his face before S. John, and saw the collars that were laid on
his neck and the cord that bound his hands and feet; and the youth loosened
them, and kissed S. John's toes.  And the youth drew nigh, and stood on a place
that was elevated, and beckoned with his hand, and began to tell from the <A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A>
commencement, how he had come to the bath, and all that had happened; and he
told <i> </i>with a loud voice before the people, how he had committed
fornication with the harlot, and how the holy (man) had bidden him not to come
(again). And they began to cry out, &quot;What did he do to thee that thou
didst die?&quot; He says to them: &quot;Thus he said to me: 'May the Lord Jesus
rebuke thee, whom the Jews crucified in
Jerusalem, and He died and was buried, and rose after three days, and
ascended to Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of His Father;' and
straightway the angel smote me and I fell down. And he took out and carried away my soul, and brought me nigh,
and I saw the glory (of God) and a dreadful sight, which one of mankind is not
able to narrate, such as I have seen; yet a little out of much, if this (man) who is standing before you bids me, will I
tell.&quot;</p>

<p>And straightway the father of
the youth fell upon his face before John, and said to him : &quot;I beg of
thee, sir, permit the youth to speak, and be not angry with him.&quot; And the
holy (man) made a sign to the youth to speak; and the youth answered and said: </p>

<p>&quot;I saw the chariot of the cherubim, (and) seraphim without number, who
had wings, and they were covering their faces that they might not look upon the Creator, and were crying, <i> </i>'Holy,
holy, holy (is) the Lord Almighty, of whose praises Heaven and earth are full.'
And I saw twelve men in one band, and in another seventy-two, and I counted
them; and they were standing with their heads uplifted
to heaven. And a right hand was stretched out from between the cherubim, like fire, and it commanded
<A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A> them in a
low and gentle voice: 'Go forth, teach, and baptize in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Spirit  of holiness; every one who believes and is
baptized, shall live.'  And I trembled; and being afraid, I drew near to the
great troop of seventy-two, and was also  entreating them to tell me, who this
is; and they answered and said to me: 'This is the Son of God, whom the Jews
crucified in Jerusalem; all this, my son, whatever thou seest, is dependent
upon and subsists by His nod,  and He upholds all the arrangements of the
upper world, and by His power subsist all the creatures of the lower worlds;
because He is the Power and the Wisdom of the Father, and He sent Him to
deliver all those who cleave unto and take refuge with Him; and He draws and
brings unto His Father all who believe in Him; and He it is who acknowledged, 
whilst  walking  on  the  earth,  'I am the living bread,  who am come down
from Heaven, and every one who eats of my body, shall live.'  And when I had
observed His true aspect, I looked upon the band of twelve, and saw this man
there, who, lo, is standing before you, clad in glorious white robes,  and
standing at the head of the band of twelve, beside an old man; and the eyes of
those eleven were looking upon him lovingly, as if he were offering some
petition on their behalf, but his eyes were raised aloft, and he was weeping.
And the old man drew nearand
asked him, 'My son, why weepest thou and prayest thus?' <A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
And I had learned,
when I asked the band of seventy, that Simon was the name of the old man. And
S. John complied with the wish of Simon and said to him: 'Because of the error
of the city  of Ephesus I am weeping, for lo, it is bound down, and its
children,   and worships  the  devils  who  dwell in the doomed images.' And I saw a gentle voice, which
made a sign to him with the finger, (saying:) 'Go; all that thou hast prayed before me, shall happen.' And whilst trembling, I noticed him, that
it was this man against whom I rose up to kill him in the bath, because he
hindered me from fornication. And whilst I was marvelling at these many
evidences, my soul heard his voice and came and lived; and lo, I stand before
you. And now therefore, lo, I beseech him to let me draw nigh to the living
sign, and to make me his disciple. And ye who  have seen this wonder, do ye
turn from error, and despise the images, and let us become disciples of His,
and let us save our souls alive, and not destroy them with our own hands; and
when He has consecrated us, then let us confess and worship Him, believing in
the Father and the Son and the Spirit of holiness, now, and at all times, and
for ever and ever, Amen.&quot; </p>

<p>And a great multitude had come and
was assembled there; and they went forth unto them outside of the bath, the
father of the youth holding (the hand of) the holy (man). And the youth was
coming, with his hands <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A> lifted up to Heaven. And they came and arrived at the
great square in the midst of the city, and the whole city was assembled; and it
was the ninth hour. And the whole city was agitated, men and women and
children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the priests, when they saw the sign
that had taken place, and the youth standing up and become a preacher of
the Gospel, said: &quot;This is one of the race of our lady Artemis.&quot; But
S. John was crying out: &quot;I am a man subject to passions, and the Lord
Jesus hath chosen me, the Son of God, who
came down from Heaven, and entered by the ear of the Virgin, and dwelt
in her womb nine months, and came forth from her without destroying her
virginity, and lived in the world as a man,
apart from sin, whilst He was God like His Father; and the Jews took Him, and
crucified Him upon the tree in Jerusalem; and He died, and was buried,
and rose after three days, and ascended to Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of His Father.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the procurator, the
father of the youth, heard these things, he fell down on his face before the
feet of the holy (man), and all the chief men of the city, from the ninth to
the eleventh hour. And they were astonished, men and women, at these things;
and the half  of  the crowd were crying out: &quot;Verily, great is this
mystery, and Jesus ought to be worshipped, for He is God.&quot; Others were
saying, &quot;Artemis ought to be worshipped.&quot; These, then, who were held
worthy to believe, with their daughters and sons,  were about <A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
36,706 souls, on that
afternoon, who were numbered in the evening
and their number was given to the procurator. And when there was a great crush
and tumult, and the day was on the
wane, John encouraged the procurator to stand up, saying to him:
&quot;Arise, thou pleasant tree, that yields
early fruit, whose smell is sweet and its odour diffused by the Gospel. Arise, my brother ! and bid thy nobles
arise with thee. Arise, and thy head shall be lifted
up, and not sink again. Do not worship me, who am a slave, made and
created; but worship and praise Him, who
formed us and created us.&quot; And all the nobles lifted up their
heads, kneeling upon their knees, and looked on the holy (man), and saw his
face like light ; and they bowed down their faces to the ground, being afraid,
for they thought that at that time their lives would perish from among the sons of men. And being afraid, they
lifted up their voices, crying out: &quot;Verily, great is this God, who is
newly preached  in this our city; and these are (things) made and are not gods;
and we are the servants of This (One), and
will not again be perverted so as to bow down our head before idols
which have not profited us and will not profit us We beg of thee, thou who art
His servant, bring us near before Him, and let us know His ways, and make us
look on His paths, for the good servant, who loves his master, knows to work
his pleasure, and his master too hears him.&quot;</p>

<p>And the
holy (man), when he heard these things, was <A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A>
rejoicing in the Spirit of holiness. And
he stretched out his hands to them, and made them rise, and said to them:
&quot;Peace be unto you, little flock, for  your Father  has willed to give
unto you the kingdom which is reserved for His friends. Arise, new
congregation, which has assembled to-day to hear the Gospel of Jesus, the Son
of God. I beg of you, my brethren, salute one another with a holy kiss, because
the time is short, and the sun has finished his course, which he was commanded
by This (One), whom I preach unto you, to run; and especially too, because
there are here persons, who have not yet tasted bread or water.&quot; But they
were crying with a loud voice: &quot; Sweeter far are Thy words to the roof of
my palate than honey to the mouth; for<sup> </sup>verily we are hungry
and thirsty, and we receive nourishment from thy pleasant word.&quot; But S. John besought the procurator that the crowd should be dismissed,
praying in his heart with sighs and saying: &quot;Lord Jesus, grant
concord to our congregation; and let Satan be driven out, that he may not cast
discord or sedition into this city, and people die (thereby).&quot;</p>

<p>And the procurator arose and
beckoned with his hand that they should be quiet. And when they were still, he
began to speak with them, and answered and said: &quot;My brethren and children
and friends, if it be pleasing unto you, let us depart at this time from one
another; and to-morrow morning I wish that you should assemble <A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A>
at the theatre;
and whatever is the will of the Spirit,<sup> </sup>which we have heard from the mouth of this
man, we will do. For this is fitting for us, that all night each man in his
house should offer up prayer and entreaty before our Lord, who is in Heaven and
brings us nigh unto His Father, on account of our sins, because we have let our
feet go astray from His way. If He willeth to mingle us with the bands of those
that praise Him, (it is well); and if not, he will (yet) deliver us from the
fire that is laid up for the worshippers of idols.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the clerk had finished
this proclamation, the whole multitude cried out with a loud voice: &quot;Peace
be unto thee, thou wise ruler! peace be unto thee, thou wise chief!  Peace be
unto thee, thou goat, that hast entered (into the fold) and become a lamb! Thou
hast shown to-day thy love to us; to-day thou hast become a true chief  unto 
us,  and  hast  given us counsel that we might live and not die.&quot;</p>

<p>And when they had finished
their outcry, after the nobles had quieted them, the multitude dispersed, and
began to go away rejoicing. And the priests of Artemis assembled, and blew
horns and lighted lamps; and the <A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A> gates of the temple were opened; and all the
people of Ephesus ran to the temple, as was their custom. And the procurator
was enraged, and wished, he and the nobles, to send and massacre the priests, because they had made an assembly without their order. But S.
John threw himself upon his face and
besought them, (saying): &quot;Whosoever keeps my word and loves our
Lord Jesus, let him not go and injure them there, because they too, through
your prayers, shall draw nigh unto the mystery of life, and become brethren of
ours.&quot; And then they obeyed the holy
(man).</p>

<p>And some
of the nobles, whose names were Antoninus, Marcellus,
Epiphanius, and Fortunatus, gave orders, and their slaves ran and brought a hundred and
fifty lamps of papyrus to give light, and
said by way of petition to the procurator: &quot;It beseems us not to
go away this whole night, lest the city be
set on fire by the hands of the
worshippers of idols, and they be saying, 'Because they forsook the fear
of Artemis, fire has fallen in their houses,'
and they blame Artemis, whilst she (really) can do nothing; and especially,
that there may be no murders.&quot;</p>

<p>And when
the multitude heard these things, they took S. John upon their shoulders, and ran; and
from their joy they did not know what they were crying out. And the foremost
ran (and) opened the doors of the theatre; and the procurator and his nobles
went in with great pomp. And they ran to spread (carpets) and arrange <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A>
(a seat) for him, according to custom. And the procurator said: &quot;It is not fitting for me any longer to sit upon
the throne; take (it) away from here.&quot; And the whole multitude came into
the theatre and there was a great tumult. And the sun was set about two hours.
And some of the councillors of the
procurator besought of him that a thousand men might go out, and
perambulate the city, and keep watch till dawn, that no harm might happen,
since S. John had begged that no one should be killed; &quot; and if they catch
any man, let them say to him: 'There
are two watches in the city, one made by Satan in the temple of Artemis, and
one made by our Lord Jesus in the theatre; to whichsoever thou choosest to go,
go.'&quot; And when the multitude
heard these things, they were glad, and stretched out their hands to Heaven,
saying: &quot;Glory to Thee, Creator of Heaven and earth, and of night and
day.&quot; And the procurator commanded,
beckoning to them with his hand, that they should be quiet, and said to
them: &quot;Let not our assembly become uproarious and tumultuous, but let us
be still, and hear the word of life, and see by what we live.&quot; And he
commanded, and they brought S. John to the highest row (of seats), and the
nobles sat beneath his feet. And the procurator was standing, and did not wish
to sit down, saying: &quot;I beg of you that I may stand, that, if there be a
man who is weak in his body, I may go over and awaken him that he slumber not.&quot; And he could hardly be
persuaded <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A> to sit down. And when he had sat down, there was a great silence.</p>

<p>And when they were quiet, S.
John sprang up, and stood, and beckoned to them with his  hand  to  keep
silence; and brought  out  the cross that was  on neck, and looked upon it, and
laid it on his eyes, and kissed it. And after he had wept, he stretched out hi
right hand,  and  signed with  it  the whole  assembly, and placed it on the
highest row (of seats), which was the most eastern of all, and had lamps placed
before it And they cried with a loud voice
and said:  &quot;Thou servant of Jesus, declare unto us, what this is
that thou hast done unto us.&quot; And the
holy (man) beckoned unto them, and they were silent; and he began to
speak and; said: &quot;Beloved children, whom the Gospel hath won, this is the
Cross of the Son of God, who was eternally with His Father, and He made these
heavens and these stars that are arrayed in
them, and on Him depend all His creatures. And I have made this Cross a
bulwark for you, that Satan may not come,
and assemble his demons, and make sleep enter into you or heedlessness of mind.&quot;
And they cried out: &quot;To us this night is day, for now life is come nigh
unto us.&quot; And they quieted one another.
And when they were quiet, all the people ran; and when they had run,
they turned their  backs  to the west, and fell down on their faces before the
cross  to the east, and were weeping and
saying: &quot; We worship Thee,  Son of God, who wast suspended on the
tree.&quot; And the procurator was lying
prostrate before the cross <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A> and he went (and) stood in front, and said:
&quot; We worship Thee, Father and Son and Spirit of Holiness, for ever, Amen.&quot; And they all answered,
&quot;Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>And they were saying to John :
&quot;By our Lord Jesus (we conjure thee),
inform us how the Son of God came, and let us know, if we are drawing
nigh unto Him, and if He will forgive us all
the sacrifices and libations with which
we have polluted ourselves.&quot; And the holy (man) stood up on the
highest row (of seats), and began to speak
with them, being full of the Spirit of holiness, and he made known unto
them all the ordering of creation, and that the Son of God was with the Father
from the beginning, and was not parted nor far away from Him, and that without
Him nothing came into being (of) all that is in heaven and in earth, (of) all
things visible and invisible. And being full
of the Spirit of holiness, he was narrating before them from the Torah
and the Prophets, and how God had compassion
upon the body of the human race, which was taken in sin, and sent His only
Son and He came, and entered by the ear of the Virgin Mary, and dwelt in her
womb nine months, and from her was clothed with the body, whilst the height and depth were full of
Him, and there was no place in which He was not; and whilst forming children in
the wombs (of their mothers), He was with
His Father;  and when the nine months were fulfilled, He came forth from the
womb of the woman, whilst she remained a Virgin, and her virginity was not
destroyed but remains <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A> for ever; and He grew tip as a man, He the Great
One, who became small because He willed (it
so); and when thirty years were
fulfilled, He came to the Jordan for baptism, and was baptized by John,
the son of Zacharias, who was His servant;
and when this &quot;Jesus was baptized and
multitudes surrounded Him, the Heavens were rent, and His Father cried
out over Him, and pointed Him out with the finger, (saying:) ' This is my
beloved Son, in whom I take pleasure; hear ye Him.'  And straightway He came up
out of the water, and multitudes (were) around Him; and He, the Hidden One, who came into the world, began to perform those
miracles, which He used to do secretly, so as to do them openly; for He
was invited to a wedding-feast, and the wine ran short, and the bridegroom had
none; and he commanded the groomsmen and the
attendants to draw water and pour it into large jars, which were there.
And when the attendants had filled out the water, He made a sign and looked
upon the water, and it was blessed and
transformed and became pleasant and sweet
wine. And they all drank and were pleased; and I drank of it. And when He was
teaching in the desert, and the day inclined to its close, after the sick had
been healed, and the lepers cleansed, and the lamed walked, and (the
eyes of) the blind were opened, those who had been healed were hungry; and the
time was short, and there was no bread but
three cakes of barleymeal. And <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A> He commanded the multitude to sit down;
and He gave orders, and they brought to Him these cakes; and He looked up to
heaven, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them, and they ate, and left (some)
over, and were satisfied.    And those who ate and were satisfied, and carried
(some) away,  and went to their homes, were four 
thousand  (men),  besides  women and children. And He sent us away, that
we might go into a ship and sail on the sea, and He stayed behind on the dry
land. And when the sun had set and it was dark, the sea arose against us, and
we were tossed about all night. And in the fourth watch of the night, this
Jesus,  whom I preach unto you, came unto us walking on the sea, and we were
afraid; and when one of the disciples, my companions, saw (this), he said to
Him: 'Lord, if it be Thou, command me to come unto Thee upon the water.' And
Jesus said unto him, 'Come.'  And he walked and came<sup> </sup>unto Him. And our Lord Jesus came and
entered into the ship, and there was a great calm. And these multitudes were
astonished and said: 'Who is this, pray, that He commands the  winds and the
sea and they obey Him?' And when Jesus came to the land of the Gadarenes, they  brought unto Him all
those who were grievously afflicted with various diseases,
and madmen, and paralytics, and lunatics, and the lame; and He healed them all. And now,
<A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A> my
brethren, there cannot be numbered or counted the cures and the miracles which
this Jesus did, who is the Son of God. For just as He was seen bodily in this
world He was doing these works also when He was concealed in His Father
eternally. He appeared in the flesh from the Virgin, and wrought these signs
openly that by them He might convict Satan,
the father of falsehood and condemn him, and show the whole race of
mankind, that every one who is drawn and comes unto Him He brings him near unto
the Father who sent Him, and He does works like these. For He and His Father
are one; and because the Father loved the world, He gave Him to the Cross, and
He died for us and gave us life, and we live with Him,  and every one who
believes in Him, abides in Him. And as to what ye have asked of me and said unto
me, 'If our iniquity will be forgiven us,
and our sacrifices and our libations, and our impurity and our
uncleanness, if we draw nigh unto Him,'— lo, I say unto you, if ye believe in
Jesus, and resolve in your minds that ye will not again be mixed up with libations
and the impurity of idols, and no man of you change (his mind), and ye do not
worship the work of men's hands, but believe in the Father and the Son and in
the Spirit of holiness, I will do what He said
unto us and commanded us, when He was ascending to Heaven to His Father;
and I will cry unto Him, He will blot out your sins, and forgive your faults,
and make white your stains;  and I will anoint and soften <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A>
with oil your knees,
which you have bent, and the evil one, our enemy, has lacerated them, making
them bend before his idols, which have been made by him a dwelling place for
his devils; and I will sign for you<sup> </sup>with
His Cross, which is the sign of life, the head which He has bowed down to the
ground, and (which) is glad that it is bowed down, because it is created in the
likeness of Him who created it; and I will place a seal upon your foreheads,  that when he sees that ye are the
asylum of this Lord, he may flee and say: 'These were my kids, and were
joined unto me that they might become big he-goats, and might butt with their
horns all armies; but now the Son of the Father, who bowed Himself down and
became flesh  from the Virgin, has taken them and made white their colour,
which was (the colour of) the darkness in which I am shut up; and He has made
them new lambs, and lo, they dwell with Him.' And this mouth of yours, which
was fed fat at the table of bitter herbs,— and lo, the deceiver is proud,
because he thinks that he has made you food for the serpent, I will open it,
and place in it the living bread,  which is the
body of God, and gives life to every one who believes in Him; and I will
make you swallow the blood of the Son of
God, which was rent  on Golgotha with the spear, of this Jesus, whom,
lo, I preach unto you, who, even when ye are dead, is buried with you, and His
body and His blood remain in your flesh, and He will raise you up <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>
and ye shall
arise. Through this body ye shall come without corruption, and not to the fire
or the torment, and ye shall not see the worm that dies not, because ye have
believed in the name of the Only (-begotten), that He is the Son of God, and in
truth He is the Life-giver of the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>And after these things, the
whole assembly in the theatre cried out and said: &quot;We beg of Thee, servant
of the living God, do what thou pleasest, and let us participate in the living
Mystery, that we may live and not die; and this in haste.&quot;</p>

<p>And the
holy (man) commanded the procurator that he should have a place (made) in one of the
corners of the theatre; and the stone-cutters came, and set to work in that
very hour, and made (a place) like a cistern, and turned the water-pipe, which
went into the theatre, into the cistern, and the water came and the cistern was
filled. And it was spacious on every side, twelve cubits in length and twelve
cubits in breadth, and it was two and a half cubits deep.</p>

<p>And the holy (man) besought the
procurator to command and let fine, scented oil come, seventy pints. And he
commanded, and it came, and a vat was filled with it. And the holy (man) drew nigh, and kneeled down, and looked up
to heaven, and cried out in the midst of the theatre: &quot; Holy is the Father
and the Son and the Spirit of holiness for ever, Amen.&quot; And the whole
assembly answered, &quot;Amen.&quot; Then John
made the sign of the <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A> Cross over the oil, and said with a loud voice:
&quot;Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Spirit of holiness for
ever, Amen.&quot; And again the third time he said: &quot; Holy is the Father
and the Son and the Spirit of holiness, Amen.&quot; And straightway fire blazed
forth over the oil, and the oil did not take fire, for two angels had their
wings spread over the oil and were crying, &quot;Holy, holy, holy, Lord
Almighty.&quot;</p>

<p>And the people, when they saw
these things, were afraid with a great fear, and fell on their faces, and were
worshipping to the east. And when the oil was consecrated, then the holy (man)
drew near to the water, and signed it, and said: &quot;In the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Spirit of holiness, for ever, Amen.&quot; And
the whole people cried, &quot;Amen.&quot; And straightway these two angels came
and hovered over the water, and were crying, &quot;Holy, holy, holy, Father and
Son and Spirit of holiness,&quot; after him.  And S. John cried after them,
&quot;Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>And John answered and said to
the whole assembly: &quot;Arise in the power of God!&quot; And they all arose
with fear, and their hands were stretched out to Heaven, and they were crying
out, saying: &quot;Great is this mystery! We believe in the Father and in the
Son and in the Spirit of holiness.&quot; And it was about the eighth hour of
the night. Then the procurator drew near, and fell on his face before John, and
said to him: &quot;What is it <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A> necessary for us to do?&quot; And S. John said to
him: &quot;Strip off thy garments from thee.&quot; And when he had stripped,
the holy (man) drew nigh, and took oil in his hand, and made him a cross on his
forehead,  and anointed his whole body, and brought him&nbsp; nigh to the cistern,
and said to him: &quot;Descend, my brother!  who art become a new firstling,
which enters in at the head of the flock into the fold of the owner of the
sheep. Descend, my brother! for the lambs are looking at thee, and running that
they may go down, and become white, and get a new fair fleece, instead of that
which is rent by ravening wolves.&quot; The procurator says: &quot;What must I
say, and then descend?&quot; John says to him: &quot;According as thou hast
seen, and found true, and believed.&quot; And the crowd was silent, as if there
was not a man there, that they might see what the procurator and John
would say. And the procurator stretched out his hands to Heaven, and cried out,
weeping and saying: &quot;I believe in the Father and in the Son and in the
Spirit of holiness;&quot; and he leapt down into the font. Then the holy man
drew near, and placed his hand on the head of the procurator, and dipped him
once, crying out, &quot;In the name of the Father;&quot; and the second time,
&quot;In the name of the Son;&quot; and the third time, &quot;In the name of
the Spirit of holiness.&quot; And when he had come up out of the water, then he
clothed him in white garments, and gave him the (kiss of) peace, and said to
him: &quot;Peace be unto thee, thou new bridegroom, <A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A>
who hadst grown old and
effete in sin, and, lo, to-day art become a youth, and thy name has been
written in Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the whole multitude was
agitated, and hastened eagerly (to try) which should run down into the font.
And all the chiefs were standing around the font; and they signed to the crowd with their hands to be silent. And the
whole crowd were crying out, saying with simplicity: &quot;Brethren and
fathers, let us run and anoint ourselves with this holy oil, and bathe in this
water, and become white, lest perchance either the water become exhausted, or
the oil run short.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the holy (man) cried out
to them and said: &quot;Be quiet, blessed flock, for your Father, who is in
Heaven, has willed to give unto you His kingdom, because ye have believed in
His beloved Son.&quot; They then straightway
were quiet. Then the holy (man) drew near and said to the procurator:
&quot;Come, sit down on the fair upper row (of seats); for to-day it is fitting
that thou shouldst be honoured, for there is joy in Heaven on thy
account.&quot; And they spread cushions for him and he sat down.</p>

<p>Then he made a sign unto them
with his hand to be silent. And when they were silent, then he began to speak
with them, saying:<sup> </sup> &quot;Verily today life has come nigh
unto us. Now then, if this holy (man) gives me leave, I will speak.&quot; Then
the whole crowd cried out to John and said: &quot;In the name of Jesus, bid him
speak.&quot; And John said to him: &quot;Speak, my lord, whatever thou pleasest.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A> </p>

<p>Then the procurator said:
&quot;Hearken, my brethren! When I was (first) dipped, I opened my eyes and
saw, not that I was going down, but that I was going up to Heaven. And the second time, I looked and opened
my eyes, and saw a right hand holding a reed and writing. And the third
time, I heard a voice saying: 'The sinner, the sheep which was lost, is found;
let him come in.' &quot; </p>

<p>And S. John straightway clasped
his hands tightly behind him, and threw himself on his face before the cross,
and cried out: &quot;Glory be unto Thee, Maker of all creatures, who hast sent Thy beloved Son, and He walked
upon earth, and gave us power to go forth (and) preach His gospel in the world,
and turn the erring to repentance.'' Then he spoke to the nobles, and they took off their garments, and he drew nigh (and)
anointed them, and baptized them  in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit of holiness. And
when they were baptized, then he baptized the whole crowd, from the eighth hour
(of the night) until the sun rose. And a great multitude assembled and came;
and when it was morning, they ran and brought their children, and the holy (man) was giving them baptism till
the fifth hour. And those who received baptism were , souls. Then the
whole multitude departed for that day.</p>

<p>And the procurator took the
holy (man) to his house, and they were rejoicing and glad; and he was in his <A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A>
house three days. But on the third day the holy (man) begged that they would let him go (and) dwell in one of
the mountains. And he sent and assembled all his free men, and they were
beseeching John to remain in the palace; but
he was unwilling to be persuaded, for he said: &quot;I must wander about
through all Asia, and also in the country of Phrygia.&quot; And when he saw
that they were distressed and were weeping,
he said to them: &quot;If it were the will of the Spirit of holiness
that I should go, ye should not be distressed; but now I will remain and abide with you. Let us go out then, and
go about through the whole city, and I will look where it is fitting for
me to dwell, for the Apostles my fellows are coming
unto me.'' And these words seemed good unto them; and the procurator
took his seat with pomp, and all his nobles
were going before him. And whilst they were going round, the holy (man)
said: &quot;I beseech you, my brethren, to show me the temple of these erring ones.&quot; And the procurator came with his
retinue to the temple of Artemis, and they were wishing to slay the
priests and to burn her temple with fire. But John was beseeching (them) that
no man should be slain, saying: &quot;These will come and turn to the knowledge
of the truth; let us not destroy them with the sword.&quot; And when the holy (man) came and saw them and the
temple of folly, there was there a place which was elevated; and he saw
that place, and said: &quot;I wish to dwell here.&quot; And the procurator and the nobles commanded (them) to
<A NAME="p44"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|44</SPAN></A> make a
palace for him there. But he said: &quot;No, by the Lord Jesus; if ye build
anything, I will not dwell in it and I wish for nothing but a hut alone.&quot;
And, straightway they brought (materials) 
and made for him a hut, which was
above the temple, and he was sitting under it. And when he had sat there a long, time, there
were assembling unto him all those who believed in Jesus the Messiah our Lord,
and were being baptized; and he was communicating unto them the body and blood
of Jesus. And there was a hut above, the
temple of Artemis; and the holy (man) was sitting, and beholding the uncleanness which took place there.</p>

<p>And after three months and ten
days, the priests were assembled, and went round (and) informed the congregation of the heathens, (saying): &quot;We must celebrate a festival to our goddess; but let every man prepare whatever he
can, both oxen and sheep, and let us sacrifice (them),  and see why our goddess
is angry with us.&quot; Then the heathens were assembled, and prepared and made a feast, and sacrificed unclean sacrifices. 
And when they were assembled, John was standing above in the hut and looking at everything that took place.
And kneeling before her, they said to the priests: &quot;Ask her for
what reason, and learn of her why she has neglected and is angry with us
men.&quot; And there was dissension in the city. Then came Legion,— the sister
of her who fell into the sea, she and the swine,— and spoke in the <A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|45</SPAN></A>
doomed image; and the priests listened and were hearing from the mouth of the image the sound of a humming like that of
bees; and they made the heathens keep silence, and drew near, and laid their
ear on the mouth of the image, and the devils gave forth a voice and said:
&quot;That hut will destroy this temple; fight
not with him.  For as said that master of ours, he fought with the
Master of this (man), and the Master of this
(man) overcame him. See then and be ye also afraid of him. And we are
afraid lest his Master come to the help of this (man), and be enraged, and cast
us into the deep, and our master be deprived of two Legions. We then, lo, are
fighting that we may not be conquered; and if he conquers us, we shall be reckoned
as if his Master had conquered our master.&quot; And the priests were trembling
(with fear), and answered and said: &quot;We ask of you, my lords, who is this
man's Master?&quot; The devils
say: &quot;He is the Son of God, who
came down from Heaven; and our master did not perceive when He came
down. And He became man, and died on the Cross; and our master imagined that he
was a mere (man). And He rose on the third day from the grave and, lo, He is in
Heaven, and is assailing us.&quot; And the priests when they heard these things,
were amazed and astonished. And the
multitudes say unto them: &quot;Why are
ye amazed?&quot; And the priests answered and say: &quot;Artemis has said that
this hut will destroy this temple, and all who are initiated into her mysteries
are afraid <A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A> of this; and accordingly they are beseeching us to be afraid of this
man, who dwells in this hut, who, if he will and command, will destroy us in
the abyss.&quot;</p>

<p>And the multitudes were
straightway crying out: &quot;We renounce this Artemis, in whom there is no
use; for if of this (man), who is a slave or a disciple, the strength is so
great, (that of) his teacher or his master (must be) as much again.&quot; And
they were beating their faces and saying: &quot;Alas, what has befallen us? for our possessions have been consumed
in libations, and we have gained loss for our souls.&quot; And the priests
said: &quot;Ye are men of sense; whatever is good in your eyes, do; but we will
worship and honour Him who is able to make alive and to destroy.&quot; And they
ran down from the altar, and with speed went up to the holy (man), and cast
themselves upon their faces before the holy (man). And the whole crowd cast
cords about the image of Artemis, and pulled it down, and dragged it along,
whilst bands were crying out before it and behind it: &quot;Thou destroyer of
our lives, arise, deliver thyself! Not from heaven didst thou descend; artisans
made thee in a furnace.&quot;</p>

<p>And S. John saw that the
priests were lying on their faces, but he spoke not with them, nor they with
him; and he kneeled down among them, and made them look to the east, and was
praying and entreating. And whilst the crowd were crying out and dragging along
the image of Artemis, the multitude, who had before received baptism within the
theatre, were applauding them in stoles and robes, and were saying: <A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|47</SPAN></A>
&quot;Come in peace, our brethren and children; let us all have one
spirit. Come in peace, O congregation that was estranged from its Master, and lo, to-day has repented and been
united with the number (of the chosen). Come in peace, O flock, that was led
captive by Satan, and which its Master has brought back that the ravening
wolves might not rend it.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the procurator heard
the tumult and great outcry of the whole city, he was afraid, and arose (and) came from his palace, and went up to S. John, and
found him kneeling. And the procurator made a sign with his hand that
they should desist from (their) outcry. And he commanded and strong men arose
to restrain the crowd from going up to John. Then the procurator said to S.
John: &quot;Arise, my lord, and sign this new congregation; for if not, their
lives will perish for crying out. For lo, I see aged men whose garments are wet
with tears and sweat.&quot; Then the holy (man) lifted up his head from prayer,
and said to the procurator: &quot;I was interceding for them before our Lord
Jesus the Messiah, that He would bring them in and bring them nigh before His
Father, and pray on their behalf; for He is the door, and through Him a man
goes in, and finds pasturage; and without Him, a man is not able to draw nigh
unto the Father; and He gave the law from mount
Sinai.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the
holy (man) arose and looked on them from above, and signed
them with the sign of the Cross; and <A NAME="p48"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|48</SPAN></A>
they all fell upon their faces before
him, crying out with grief and sobbing: &quot;We have sinned and done wrong and
committed evil, and we knew it not until today. Have mercy on us, Lord! Lord of
Heaven and earth! for henceforth we abjure
all idols.&quot;</p>

<p>  Then the holy (man) cried
unto them from above: &quot;Arise in the
might of our God!  Arise in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, His beloved
Son!&quot; And straightway they arose, and were lifting up their hands to
Heaven and crying out: &quot;Glory unto Thee, God, the Maker of Heaven and of earth! Our Lord hath appeared unto
us; and we know that Thou art the true God, and that by Thee this youth was sent to the city of
Ephesus.&quot; And a cloud was overshadowing the city; and straightway there
was a low thundering. And the whole crowd fell upon their faces for fear and
say: &quot;We praise Thee, Thou hidden God, who art invisible, and lo, hast
been revealed unto us because we sought
Thee. We confess Thee, and there
is no other God but Thee.&quot;</p>

<p>Then S. John spake with them,
and was expounding unto them from the Law and from the prophets, and was teaching them concerning our Lord
Jesus,<sup> </sup>proving and showing unto them concerning
our Lord Jesus, that He is the Son of God. And they, after they had received the faith,  were beseeching that they
might receive the sign of baptism, crying out and glorifying God. And the procurator besought the holy (man),
<A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A> saying: &quot;If thou pleasest, my lord, let criers go forth in the city
and proclaim, 'Whosoever believes in the Son of God, let him come (and) bathe, and be cleansed of pollution;' and
as for us, let us go to the place where the font is, and every one who comes,
give him the sign, and let him live and not perish.&quot; S. John said to the procurator: &quot;Well hast thou spoken, my lord;
thus will we do, according to thy command.&quot; And straightway both of them arose, and the procurator made a sign
with his hand that they should be quiet. And when they were quiet, he
said to them: &quot;To you we speak, ye new
children, whom the Gospel of God hath won. Today, we being all assembled without tumult, go to the
theatre, and there ye shall receive the sign of life.&quot; They then,
being assembled, drew up bands in order, whilst they were crying out and saying
to the procurator: &quot;How must we chant and sing?&quot; The procurator says
unto them: &quot;Thus say and sing, until ye enter in, 'Glory to the Father and
to the Son and to the Spirit of holiness! Lord have mercy upon us.'&quot; And the sound of their outcry was going outside of the
city more than five miles.</p>

<p>And they came and entered into
the theatre. Then came the procurator and John, and entered into the theatre. Then the holy (man) answered and made a
sign with his hand that the crowd should be quiet. And when they were quiet,
the holy (man) stood up on the steps and <A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A>
said: &quot;Arise in
prayer.&quot; And they looked to the east, and fell on their faces, and were
saying: &quot;Lord, have pity upon us.&quot;
Then the priests, when the whole people were lying on their faces, came (and)
entered last of all, and were walking
barefooted and girded with sackcloth, with dust cast on their heads and
their faces covered with soot, and were lamenting and crying out: &quot;Thou
God, who dwellest in Heaven, have pity upon us; we have sinned before Thee, and
have caused many souls without number to sin; it is not hard for Thee to
forgive us, if Thou wilt.&quot;</p>

<p>And when
they had said these things, John arose from his prayer and said: &quot;Arise in the
might of God.&quot; And when they had
arisen, he concluded the prayer, and they all answered &quot;Amen.&quot; And he turned, and looked upon the
seven priests, who were standing in vile attire, with their heads inclined to
the east and their hands raised to Heaven,  and tears without end were running
from their eyes and dripping down upon their blackened cheeks. And when the
holy (man) saw (them), he was grieved and wept, and the procurator with him;
and the whole crowd was weeping. And the holy (man) kneeled down, and prayed, and said: &quot;Merciful God, the Father and
Sender of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, Thou, Lord, hast said, 'If the
dinner turns from his sin and does
righteousness before me, through that righteousness, which he hath done, he shall live.'  I ask of
thee, Lord, <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A> have pity upon the work of thy hands, and be not
disgusted with it. Let these be received, who were perishing like sheep which have no
shepherd, and let them praise Thy great and terrible name and Thy dear
Son our Lord Jesus the Messiah, for to Thee and to Him and to Thy holy Spirit
is glory and honour for ever, Amen.&quot; And
the whole congregation answered  &quot;Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he arose and called them,
but they were not able to speak for weeping and sobbing. And he drew near unto them, holding the procurator by his
hand, and spake with them, and they did not speak. And the holy (man)
made the sign of the cross upon the forehead of each one of them. Then there
was an outcry from the whole crowd, and the tears of S. John were running over.
And he said unto them: &quot;Take courage; there is no cutting off of hope. Hope was given to men by the birth of
the Son of God from the Virgin. Open your
mouths and speak with us. We are your members, and are formed of the
same material of which ye are formed. We are
created by one God, and are one soul. Fear not; He will not cast you off; He will not reject
you; He will not be disgusted with you. I have learned of Him, that if ye
believe in Him, ye shall rejoice at the table of His kingdom.&quot; Then those
priests answered and said before the crowd: &quot;How can our deceitful mouth
speak? What can we say? for the face of our heart is blackened more than our
external face. We cannot open our mouth to
speak. But this we know, and <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A> believe, and declare true, that there is
one God, who created the world by His grace, and His only (and) beloved Son,
our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who put on the body  from the holy  Virgin; and
whether we die, or whether we live, we know
no other man. Woe to us then, if He has not mercy upon us and does not forgive us; because we have much property and gold that passeth away, and with
these souls we have acquired it.&quot;</p>

<p>And the procurator had a wish
that they should draw near to him, because they were far from the crowd and
were standing alone. And when they went to bring them near and make them stand
in the midst, the priests say: &quot;We beg of you, do not defile your hands
with our stench. &quot;We will not draw nearer than here, until He wills it in
whose name we have believed.&quot; And it was about the third hour of that day.</p>

<p>And the
holy (man) answered and said to the procurator: &quot;Command, sir, that water come into
the font. We must baptize this assemblage,
and speak to them the word of life.
And command that tables be (laid out) through the whole city, and
whosoever wants food, our Lord Jesus, who satisfied thousands in the desert,
will prepare (a feast) before him.&quot; Then the procurator called Menelaus
his son, who became alive, and said to him: &quot;Take unto thee ten men, and let
each of them go and provide for thee a
hundred men of those who have received the
sign of baptism, and let them lay the tables, <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A>
and make ready a great
banquet.&quot; And they went and did
according to the command of the procurator.</p>

<p>And S. John arose from the
bench on which he was sitting, and came to the priests, and took hold of the hand of their chief, whose name was Apollo, and of
the hand of another, whose name was Dionysius, and drew them near to him, and was speaking  to them the
word of God, and was interpreting
(it),   and exhorting them. And Apollo and Dionysius the priests were saying
aloud: &quot;Have pity upon us, Son of God, and bring us nigh unto Thy
Father, we beg of Thee. If we are to  be  punished 
for  our  wickedness,  let not these be punished, for we  have  led 
them  astray  from Thy path. We beg of Thee, merciful Lord, have mercy, Lord, upon our wickedness. If Thy righteousness judge us, let not
these be judged, for ours, Lord, is their
corruption.&quot; And the whole people was weeping.</p>

<p>And when
the font was prepared, the procurator commanded, and oil was brought. Then S. John
arose, and prayed, and said: &quot;Glory to Thee, Father and Son and Spirit of holiness, for ever,
Amen.&quot; And they answered after him, &quot;Amen&quot; And he said:
&quot;Lord God Almighty, let Thy Spirit of
holiness come, and rest and dwell upon the oil and upon the water; and let them
be bathed and purified from uncleanness; and let them receive the Spirit
of holiness through baptism; and henceforth let them call Thee  'Our Father who
art in <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A> Heaven.' Yea, Lord, sanctify this
water with Thy voice, which resounded
over the Jordan and pointed out our Lord Jesus (as) with the finger, (saying,) 'This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him.'  Thou  art
here who wast on the Jordan. Yea,  I beseech Thee, Lord, manifest Thyself here before this assemblage who have
believed on Thee with simplicity, and let the nations of the earth hear that
the city of Ephesus  was the first to receive Thy Gospel before all cities, and
became a second sister to Urh&#257;i (Edessa) of the Parthians.&quot; And in that hour fire blazed forth over the oil, and
the wings of the angels were spread over the oil;<sup> </sup>and the whole assemblage was crying out,
men and women and children, &quot;Holy,
holy, holy, Lord Almighty, of whose
praises Heaven and earth are full.&quot; And straightway the vision was taken away.</p>

<p>And the priests fell down on
their faces and wept. And S. John drew nigh
and raised them up, and they said: &quot;We believe in the name of the
Father and the Son and the Spirit of holiness, and we will never know aught
else.&quot; And John drew near, and washed them (clean) of the soot, and
anointed them with oil, and baptized them in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Spirit of holiness, for the forgiveness of debts and the pardon of
sins. And S. John said to the procurator: &quot; Command that they go and fetch
fine white bread and wine, whilst the whole
multitude is being baptized.&quot; <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And they
went, (and) prepared, and made ready every thing. And when the whole multitude was
baptized, the priests say: &quot;Brothers and fathers  and sons, today we bear the Cross of our Lord Jesus the
Messiah. Why stand over the gates of our city the images of the daughter of Satan? Let us go (and) pull them down
and burn them, and place over all 
the gates the Cross of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.&quot; And the whole
multitude were crying out, &quot;Where ought
we to make a church?&quot; And S. John was glad and rejoicing; and he
said to the procurator: &quot;Look, sir, where it pleaseth thee.&quot; And they
chose a place which was fitting, and bore the cross and came  thither, and set
up there the cross, and over the gates of the whole city crosses. And the holy (man) prayed, and offered the (eucharistic)
sacrifice, and let them partake of the body and blood of the Messiah;
and thither they were assembling every Sunday, and were breaking (bread)
together, and were partaking of the body and
blood of our Lifegiver.</p>

<p>After
these things, when the Gospel was increasing by the hands of the
Apostles, Nero, the unclean and impure and wicked king,
heard all that had happened at Ephesus. And he sent (and) took all that the
procurator had, and imprisoned him; and laid hold of S. John and drove him into
exile; and passed sentence on the city that it
should be laid waste.</p>

<p>And after three days, believing
men of the city assembled, and counselled one another and said: <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A>
&quot;Let us assemble at the church, and
see what each man is willing to give, and take a bribe, and offer it to this
wicked ruler, and he will give up to us this (man), who turned us away from
error unto our Lord.&quot; And when they had taken counsel thus, they collected
three hundred pounds of gold, and took ten men, and they went on board a ship
to go to Nero, the wicked king, and give the bribe, and bring back the holy
(man).</p>

<p>And when they had gone and entered into
Rome, at midnight, when the impure Nero was asleep, the Lord sent to him an
angel; and he appeared to him in a flame and bearing a sword, and awakened him.
And when he had opened his eyes and looked upon him, he cried out and said:
&quot;I pray thee, what I have to do with thee?&quot; The angel says to him:
&quot;Send back the man whom thou hast taken from Ephesus and cast into exile;
and if not, this sword shall enter into thy unclean heart before the sun rises.&quot; And the angel smote him and took away his speech, and he was howling like a dog. And
his slaves came in when they heard his lamentation, and said to him: 
&quot;What is the matter with thee, my lord the king?&quot; And he made a sign,
and they brought him ink and a sheet of paper, and he wrote: &quot;Straightway,
— if it be possible, today,— let John, the
son of Zebedee, the Galilean, whom I took away from Ephesus, pass the
night in it.&quot; And he wrote also, and sent (word) to Ephesus quickly, that
every one who was in prison, should come out and do as he pleased.&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A></p>

<p>And there came sailors and men clad in
arms, and took the letters written by the king's hand, and went on board ship, and went (and) found John at midday
kneeling and praying. They say to him: &quot;The king has commanded
that we should convey thee to the place where thou wast.&quot; And they took
him, and went on board ship, and sailed on the sea in peace, and brought him to
the gate  of Ephesus, and returned to Rome.</p>

<p>And those men who had brought the bribe,
when they
heard that the holy (man) had returned to Ephesus, said: &quot;We worship Thee,
Father and Son and Spirit of holiness, who hast done what Thy fearers
wished.&quot; And they went on board ship, and brought those three hundred pounds (of gold with them), and came. And
when they had entered Ephesus, they showed  the gold and narrated all
that had happened, and there was joy through the whole city; and they took
counsel one with another, and deposited the gold in a house, and hired
artificers, and built with it two churches for the worship of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.</p>

<p>And S. John went up (and) sat in the hut;
and all the free men of the province of Asia
gathered together unto him, and he
was teaching and preaching concerning our Lord Jesus; and the word of
Nero was established over his own place, but he did not dare again to give
orders regarding the province of Asia. It was this wicked man, who slew Paul
and Peter.</p>

<p>And after a long interval, when the
Apostles <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A> heard all that had happened in the whole country of the Ephesians,
they were amazed, and said: &quot;This thing is not great for our Lord Jesus,
hut to us it is wondrous.&quot; And Paul was asking and inquiring of the
Apostles, that he might hear the history of S. John; and every day and every
hour he was supplicating before God, that he might be deemed worthy to see him.</p>

<p>And when the Gospel rose upon the world,
the Spirit of holiness willed, and Matthew was moved and composed the Evangel;
and after him, Mark; and after him, Luke. And they wrote, and sent (word) to
the holy John that he too should write, and informed him concerning Paul, who
had entered into the number of the Apostles. But the holy (man) did not wish to
write (a Gospel), saying that they should not say &quot;He is a youth,&quot; if
Satan cast dissension into the world.</p>

<p>And when the Apostles had travelled about
in the countries, and had planted the Cross, and it had spread abroad over the
four quarters of the world, then Simon Cephas (Peter) arose, and took Paul with
him, and they came to Ephesus unto John. And they rejoiced with a great joy,
and were preaching concerning our Lord Jesus  without hindrance. And they went
up to the holy (man), and found him praying. And they saluted
one another, and rejoiced with a great joy, <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A>
and narrated to one another all
that our Lord Jesus had done, and appointed
(as) priests believing men.</p>

<p>Peter and Paul entered Ephesus on a
Monday, and for five days they were persuading him, whilst rejoicing, to
compose an Evangel, but he was not willing, saying to them, &quot;When the
Spirit of holiness wills it, I will write.&quot; And on the Sunday, at night,
at the time when our Lord arose from the grave, the Apostles slumbered and
slept. And at that glorious time of the Resurrection, the Spirit of holiness
descended, and the whole place, in which they were dwelling, was in a flame;
and those men who were awake, awakened their fellows, and they were amazed. And
John took paper, and wrote his Evangel in one hour, and gave it to Paul and to
Peter.  And when the sun rose, they went down to the house of prayer, and read
it before the whole city, and prayed, and partook of the body and blood of our
Lord Jesus. And they came to the holy (man), and remained with him thirty days;
and then they came to Jerusalem, to Jacob (James), the brother of our Lord, and thence they came to Antioch.</p>

<p>And the holy (man) sat in the hut summer
and winter,  until he was a hundred and twenty years of age, and there his Master buried  him in that place, as
Moses was buried on Mount Nebo.</p>

<p>Every one who believes, and gives credence
to the signs, which our Lord did by the hands of the Apostles, shall find mercy
at the day of judgement. And to the <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A> Spirit of holiness, who is in the Father
and the Son, everything is easy. And let the
children of the Church, without division, offer up praise, without
investigation, to the Father and to the Son and to the Spirit of holiness, for ever, Amen.</p>

<p>Here ends the Doctrine of John the son of
Zebedee, who leaned on the breast of our Lord Jesus at the supper,  and
instructed and taught and baptized in the city
of Ephesus.</p>
