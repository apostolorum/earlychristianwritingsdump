For Marcion, Bardaisan, and Ephraim, these statements are taken from the <i>Chronicon
Edessenum </i>(ed. Guidi, 1903). The date of Mani's birth is given by Mani
himself in the Shapurakan (quoted by Al-Biruni, pp. 121, 190); his Religion is
dated according to An-Nadim (Flügel, p. 149, corrected in Nöldcke, <i>Geschichte
der Perser und Araber, </i>p. 412). The <i>Chronicon Edessenum </i>puts Mani's
birth in 240 A.D., by a confusion with the date of the proclamation of
Manicheism.</p>

<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTORY ESSAY&nbsp;</h3>
<p align="center">BY F. C. BURKITT</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. <i>The MS. Sources.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THE texts edited in these volumes of S. Ephraim's Prose Refutations are the
contents of a sixth-century MS. in the British Museum, the two parts of which
are numbered Add. 14574 and Add. 14623. The technical description of these MSS.
is given in a separate Note : it will suffice here to say that 14574 contains
the first 19 leaves (<i>i.e. </i>the first two quires) in their original
condition, while 14623 consists of the 88 leaves which a monk named Aaron used
in 823 A.D. for transcribing a fresh volume of miscellaneous contents. The
original writing was washed out, and as Aaron's own hand is both small and thick
it is often very difficult to decipher the ancient script underneath ; the new
order of the leaves, moreover, bears no relation to the old, so that it was one
of Mr. Mitchell's first difficulties to discover the original sequence of the
fragments he transcribed. But this was happily and completely done, and one
result was to establish the fact that, irregular as the order was, the 88 leaves
of Add. 14623 contain nothing but leaves from the same ancient codex, and that
no intermediate gaps occur. The 88 leaves of 14623 are actually the 88 leaves
that once came after fol. 19 of Add. 14574. We may therefore reasonably infer
that very little is missing at the end, and treat what survives as a connected
whole.</p>
<p>From the scribe's point of view the volume consisted of two parts, of nearly
equal size. Part I contained the Five Books addressed to Hypatius, edited in
vol. i of this edition ; this part has the headline 'Of Hypatius' at the middle
and ends of the quires. Part II is more miscellaneous : it consists of seven
pieces, none of which have any organic connexion with the others, though <A HREF="#cxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxii</SPAN></A>
they are all by S. Ephraim. The first of these is directed against certain
opinions of Bardaisan about Space and Perception which were contained in a work
of his called 'Of Domnus (<font face="SPEdessa">swYMdd</font>).' Accordingly the
scribe uses 'Of Domnus' for the headlines of his Part II, but the title is
merely a scribe's fancy, and the remaining six pieces have nothing to do with
Domnus. It is not even certain what the title 'Of Domnus' for the lost work of
Bardaisan really signified. It may have been a work addressed to a certain
Domnus, just as Ephraim's 'Of Hypatius' is the scribe's short title for
Ephraim's Five Books addressed to Hypatius. But nothing is known of such a
personage. There was a Domnus Bishop of Antioch, the rival of Paul of Samosata,
in 269 A.D., but the name was not common in early times.</p>
<p>Following Ephraim's polemic against Bardaisan's <i>Domnus </i>come three
tracts against Marcion, succeeded by a metrical discourse against Bardaisan, and
a quasi-metrical discourse on Virginity. It is not easy to see why this latter
piece was included in the collection, as it has nothing to do with the heresies
attacked in the other pieces. Finally there is a prose tract against Mani, which
appears to have concluded the volume ; this work is quite distinct from the
Discourses to Hypatius, and contains some important references to Manichean
doctrines and nomenclature, as well as some direct quotations from lost works by
Bardaisan and his school.</p>
<p>I have been able to supply from other sources a certain number of
confirmations and additions to the text of Add. 14623, so ingeniously deciphered
by Mr. Mitchell. These are : (1) a long quotation from Book IV and a short
quotation from Book V of the <i>Hypatius</i>,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> both
taken from one of the ancient collections of doctrinal Extracts in which the
Nitrian Library was so rich. The two quotations together make up 103 lines,
which is just as long as one of the three-column pages of the MS, or as one of
the pages of the English translation.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Short as the
extracts are they afford a most valuable indication of the degree of accuracy
which Mr. Mitchell was able to attain in the difficult work of decipherment, and
encourage readers who cannot examine the Palimpsest <A HREF="#cxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxiii</SPAN></A>
for themselves to accept the Syriac text as printed in these volumes with a very
considerable measure of confidence.</p>
<p>(2) Similar extracts from the metrical Discourse against Bardaisan will be
found noted in the text of this volume. The longest of these are taken from Add.
14623 itself, as the monk Aaron, before obliterating the ancient writing, copied
out the equivalent of six pages of the printed Syriac, <i>i.e. </i>between two
and three pages of the ancient MS. A good deal of the part thus copied out by
Aaron and now preserved in the upper writing of 14623 is practically illegible
in the ancient writing, so that the extracts make a considerable addition to our
knowledge.</p>
<p>(3) Aaron copied out the whole of the Discourse on Virginity, which therefore
survives entire. Unfortunately, from the point of view of the modern scholar,
this is much the least interesting piece in the volume, but as in the case of
the other extracts it enables us to check Mr. Mitchell's work in parts where the
Palimpsest is too illegible to make a continuous text. It is curious that Mr.
Mitchell should not have noticed these extracts from the lower text in the upper
writing, all the more as the extracts from the Discourse against Bardaisan had
been published long ago by Overbeck. But it was a fortunate oversight, for (as I
said above) it enables us to check the accuracy of his work of transcription.</p>
<p>(4) The Discourse on Virginity, which is written in a poetical style, but not
in any regular metre, was afterwards turned into metrical Hymns by a process of
curtailment and transposition. This form survives in Vat. Syr. cxi. (A.D. 522)
and some later MSS. in the British Museum. The text is printed by Lamy at the
end of his vol. ii., but as we possess Aaron's transcript of the original there
was no need to record the variations.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2. <i>S. Ephraim as a Controversialist.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>From the point of view of a modern scholar, whose chief interest is to
recover the lost works and theories of ancient thinkers, whether orthodox or
heterodox, S. Ephraim's literary methods are very unsatisfactory. He makes few
direct quotations from the writers whom he is controverting, nor does he explain
the <A HREF="#cxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxiv</SPAN></A> outlines of their system, or
distinguish the books of his opponents. It is all piecemeal work. No effort is
made to understand the opponent's system as a whole, but single debating points
are taken, sometimes with a good deal of ingenuity, in order to shew the weak
places of the adversary. As we do not possess the corresponding Marcionite or
Bardesanian polemic against the Catholic system, the result is to give an
impression of Catholic common sense as opposed to heretical fancy or
perverseness.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate in two ways. At the time, no doubt, it was quite an
effective method of convincing Ephraim's supporters that reason was on their
side and folly on the side of the vaunted heretical philosophy. In our day it
has sometimes an opposite effect. We see that justice is not being done to the
heretics, that the Catholic writer, who alone now survives, is both judge and
advocate. We dimly feel that the controversy is about great subjects, that these
heretics were thinkers conscious of the difficulties of the greater problems of
human life, some of which still perplex us. and we sometimes, by a kind of
reaction, tend to assume that the heretical systems were really philosophical,
nearer to our ways of thinking than the world in which the Catholic
controversialist lived. At least we tend to assume that the systems of the
greater heretics were consistent wholes.</p>
<p>Yet this is by no means certain. I venture to hope that a really consistent
philosophy, unhampered by definitely wrong beliefs, whether about the physical
or moral world, would have had more power of successful resistance. The religion
both of Marcion and of Mani must have had in them much that corresponded to
human needs, or they would not have had their long and honourable records of
persistence under persecution ; but they were both hampered by irrational
elements.</p>
<p>One point may be urged in S. Ephraim's favour. So far as we know, though he
is unsympathetic he is not unfair. He does not seem actually to misrepresent the
theories of his opponents or to misquote them. The worst that can be said is
that he seems totally unconscious of the difficulties involved in these
controversies, and this all the more as his work is wholly critical and
destructive, except to a certain extent in the treatise against Bardaisan's <i>Domnus.
</i>He is content with picking holes in his antagonists <A HREF="#cxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxv</SPAN></A>
and does not give us his own philosophy, except by scattered hints.</p>
<p>On this perhaps a few words may be said, mainly with regard to the meaning of
certain Syriac terms. Ephraim may be described as a Monist and a Materialist.
That is to say, he recognises only one self-existing original entity or being<i>
</i>(<font face="SPEdessa">)YtY)</font> ,<i> Ithya</i>), viz. God. The opposite
to an <i>Ithya </i>is <font face="SPEdessa">)dYBB</font> (p. 219, l. 41), <i>i.e.
</i>a thing made. What we see around us in this world are made things, things
which came into being by God's will. Properties and characters were given to
made things by God's will, and so, if He wills it, their properties are liable
to change. An <i>Ithya, </i>on the other hand, does not and cannot change ; it
has a 'bound nature ' ([Syriac]).</p>
<p>At the same time, created things do actually exist; they have 'substance,'
which varies according to the 'nature' of the thing. For 'substance' the Syriac
is [Syriac] (<i>knoma</i>), and for 'nature' [Syriac]<i> </i>(<i>kyana</i>). The
word <i>knoma </i>is of considerable interest, inasmuch it has been chosen to
render <font face="SPIonic">u9po&amp;stasis</font>,<i> i.e. </i>'Person' in
speaking of the Trinity, while <i>bar kydna</i> ('of the same Nature') is used
for <font face="SPIonic">o9moou&amp;sion</font><i>. </i>The special value of the
use of these words in these treatises is that S. Ephraim is employing them
philosophically, yet quite apart from their special theological use to render
certain Greek technical terms.</p>
<p>I have translated <i>knoma </i>by 'substance,' but this meaning shades off
into 'individuality,' and no doubt this was the aspect of the word that made it
appropriate to render <i>Hypostasis </i>or <i>Person </i>in the Trinitarian
sense. On p. 63, 1. 30, we find &quot;David his <i>knoma</i>,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>
&quot;David in his own person,&quot; as distinguished from some son or
descendant of David. Yet I think there is in <i>knoma </i>always the notion of
reality, <i>i.e. </i>of materiality. Ephraim talks about 'black <i>knome</i>'
(p. 41, 1. 36), and in p. 174, 1. 20, it is used of wood. The whole passage
indeed is worth quotation, as it exhibits very well Ephraim's philosophy of
substance. &quot;Fire,&quot; he says, &quot;is buried and dead imperceptibly (in
wood), and the rubbing of one bit of wood with another brings it to life, to the
destruction of both. For when it has come to life it turns and burns the
substance which gave it life by being conjoined with it.&quot; That is to say,
Fire is a separate substance really existing within <A HREF="#cxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxvi</SPAN></A>
the substance of wood. On the other hand, verbal nouns like 'buying' and
'selling' have no substance (p. 18, 1. 34 f.); they are only notions in the
mind.</p>
<p>Ephraim's argument to prove that Space has no substance should be read at
length (pp. iv—viii). It seems to me a very creditable piece of reasoning,
especially in view of the fact that he did not possess two pieces of mental
apparatus which facilitate our discussions of such subjects. He had no word for
'Space' as such, which we can so easily represent to our eyes by the use of a
capital letter and (where necessary) of inverted commas ; and neither he nor his
opponent Bardaisan had the idea of Cartesian axes, whereby all space is rendered
manageable by dividing it into eight cubes all meeting at a definite point, from
which measures can be taken.</p>
<p>What is perhaps more remarkable is that Ephraim does not regard Darkness as
substantial (p. 40, 11. 7-12). No doubt he was helped to this view by the
contrary views of Bardaisan and Mani, who held Darkness to be something
positive.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> After all, it is partly a question of
terminology. Whatever the corresponding Greek and Latin words may mean,
'Darkness' in English is wholly unsubstantial, the mere absence of Light. But
[Syriac] <i>(heshshoxa) </i>in Syriac means the Dark substance, <font face="SPIonic">to_
skoteino&amp;n</font> quite as much as the state of Darkness, <font face="SPIonic">to_
sko&amp;tos</font>. In translating the notions of Bardaisan and Mani into
English it is therefore often more appropriate to speak of <i>the Dark </i>or <i>the
Dark substance </i>than of <i>the Darkness.</i></p>
<p><i>Kydna, </i>'nature,' is exactly <font face="SPIonic">fu&amp;sis</font><i>.
</i>It implies generally a set of qualities or characteristics. No
transliteration of <font face="SPIonic">ou0si/a</font> is used in these
treatises, and <i>parsopa </i>occurs only once (ii. p. 26, 1. 16), where it
seems to mean 'person' in the ordinary English sense, <i>i.e. </i>'individual.' <A HREF="#cxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxvii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. <i>The System of Marcion.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These treatises tell us more about Syriac-speaking Marcionites than is told
in any other extant source. The main result is to shew that they were very
similar in their beliefs and practices to the Marcionites elsewhere, especially
as described in Eznik's well-known chapters against them.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
In fact, it is very likely that Eznik's account is not so much an original
description of the Armenian Marcionites known to him as a translation from some
early Syriac writer.</p>
<p>It is important to notice at the outset that S. Ephraim's polemic against
Marcion differs in one respect from that of Tertullian and Epiphanius: there is
no controversy about Marcion's Gospel. Marcion, who rejected the authority of
the Old Testament as the work of the Adversary of Jesus, considered that most of
the writings current among Christians had been interpolated in the interests of
Judaism, and the only Gospel he received was a shortened recension of Luke.
According to Tertullian and Epiphanius, with whom almost all modern scholars are
in agreement, Marcion's Gospel was an arbitrary mutilation of the text, while
Marcion no doubt regarded it as the genuine Evangel purged of alien elements. In
any case it was obviously a variant form of the canonical Luke, and opponents of
Marcion who were accustomed to use the Canonical Luke were concerned to
vindicate the superiority of the text familiar to them. But Ephraim and the
branch of the Catholic Church to which he belonged habitually used the
Diatessaron, not the four separate Gospels. He seems to have been quite
unfamiliar with the Gospels as separate literary works (though he knew something
about the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel),<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> and
probably did not recognise Marcion's Gospel as being one of the Canonical Four
used by Greek and Latin orthodox Christians. However that may be, he says
nothing about it. Possibly he did not even know the Marcionite Gospel itself,
and only bases his polemic on Marcionite theological and controversial works
which quote it. <A HREF="#cxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxviii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most striking new fact about Marcionite usage brought out by these
treatises is that the Syriac-speaking Marcionites used a different
transliteration of the name 'Jesus' from the orthodox. The ordinary Syriac for
'Jesus' is <font face="SPEdessa">Ow4Y</font> (pronounced <i>'Isho' </i>by
Nestorians but <i>Yeshu' </i>by Jacobites), which is simply the Syriac form of
the Old Testament name Joshua.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> This form <font face="SPEdessa">Ow4Y</font>
was used not only by the orthodox, but also by the Manichees. It was therefore a
surprise to find that Ephraim in arguing against Marcionites, and certainly in
part quoting from their books or sayings, uses the form wsY, a direct
transcription of the Greek <font face="SPIonic">)Ihsou~</font><i> </i>(or <font face="SPIonic">0Ihsou~j</font>).
As it is always written <font face="SPEdessa">wsY</font>, never <font face="SPEdessa">wsY)</font>,
I suppose the pronunciation intended is IESU rather than ISU, but I have
retained Mitchell's ISU (vol. i. p. li), not only for uniformity but also
because it was desirable to emphasise the strangeness of the form <font face="SPEdessa">wsY</font>.</p>
<p>When Ephraim uses this Marcionite transliteration he is evidently basing his
argument on Marcionite texts. The question therefore does arise, how far his
references to Gospel incidents are quotations from the Marcionite Gospel. My
first impression on reading the First Discourse against Marcion (pp. 50-102) was
that he was working on a copy of that Gospel, or at least was conscious of its
main peculiarities. After an argument about Adam and the nature of his
punishment he goes on to discuss the message of John the Baptist to ISU (pp.
61-87), and this is followed by a discussion of the Transfiguration. Both these
incidents are contained in Marcion's Gospel, and most of the textual allusions
might be regarded as taken from Luke, though the wording often differs from the
ordinary Syriac. But a closer examination made this view more than doubtful: I
think Ephraim was, as usual, quoting the Diatessaron loosely from memory, and I
do not think there is any tangible evidence that he knew that certain of his
Gospel references were taken from passages and incidents which had no place in
Marcion's Gospel-book, so that their citation had no weight in an argument
against Marcionites. Thus on p. 64, 1. 24, and p. 109,1. 13, he has sarcastic
references to 'the girl,' <i>i.e. </i>the daughter of Herodias, playing with
John the Baptist's head, <A HREF="#cxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxix</SPAN></A> while
on p. 108, 1. 45, the 'soldier of the guard ' is mentioned. But the whole
incident of Herod's banquet is absent from Luke, and therefore from Marcion's
Gospel, while the 'soldier' (<i>espuklatra</i>) is mentioned only in Mk. vi 27.
Again, on p. 72, 1. 26 f., Ephraim quotes 'Blessed are the meek in their spirit'
: this is an inaccurate combination of Matt, v 5 and Matt, v 3, but neither
element of the quotation is represented in the Lucan Beatitudes, accepted by
Marcion. Further, 'Blessed is he, except he be offended in me,' on p. 86, 1.
6f., agrees neither with the Syriac vulgate nor with the Sinai Palimpsest text
of Lk. vii 23, but it does agree with the Curetonian text of Matt, xi 6.
Finally, on p. 82, 1. 5, John is called a Light-bringer, which recalls Joh. v
35, but has no parallel in Luke.</p>
<p>These passages are decisive enough to shew that Ephraim, unlike Tertullian
and Epiphanius, is not attempting to confute Marcion out of his own recension of
the Gospel. Still less is there reason to regard the few references to S. Paul
as taken from the Marcionite 'Apostle.' The most interesting of these, from a
textual point of view, is the quotation of 1 Tim. ii 15 on p. 100, 1.10 f.,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
but the argument could have meant little to a Marcionite, because Marcion never
accepted the Pastoral Epistles.</p>
<p>The most we can learn from Ephraim about the Biblical exegesis of the
Marcionites comes from the few passages which he directly quotes from them. The
two most striking of these are to be found on p. 106 in the Second Discourse and
on p. 125 in the Third. On p. 106, 11. 38-42, Ephraim suggests that the only
reason Marcionites can allege for John the Baptist believing at all in Jesus is
a fantastic faith in the unknown : &quot; 'Because,' they say (<font face="SPEdessa">ml</font>),
'John was near to die he sent his flock by the hand of the two under-shepherds
to the Lord of the flock.' &quot; And again, on p. 125, 11. 40-47, Ephraim says
: &quot;Two things the Marcionites proclaim about our Lord, which are contrary
to each other, for they say (<font face="SPEdessa">ml</font>), 'He annulled
former Laws and healed diseased organs.' &quot; The interest of these simple
sentences, which are <A HREF="#cxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxx</SPAN></A> shewn by the
use of the particle <font face="SPEdessa">ml</font> to be quotations,<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
is that they seem to be polemical, isolated bits of Marcionite answer to
orthodox criticism. It is not to be expected that they will be very profound or
convincing, because they deal with points on which the Marcionite theory was
weakest, <i>viz. </i>the events of the Gospel history. John the Baptist was a
specially inconvenient figure, for he is altogether linked up with the Old
Testament and Jewish religion, and yet he appears as a forerunner of Jesus. If
John recognised Jesus at all he must, as Epiphanius says (<i>Haer. </i>xlii, p.
325), have known of Him before, while to the Marcionites Jesus is the Son of the
Stranger, and His coming was altogether unexpected and unprepared. And with
regard to the second quotation, it is easy for Ephraim to shew the inconsistency
of regarding the cure of human bodies or organs as good, seeing that the whole
domain of matter, or <i>Hyle, </i>is accounted by Marcionites as altogether
outside the plan of salvation.</p>
<p>One feature of Ephraim's polemic with the Marcionites that cannot help
striking the reader who comes to it after reading the tracts against Bardaisan
or Mani is its more Biblical character. The religion of Marcion was essentially
Christian and Biblical. He is a Dissenter from the orthodox interpretation of
the Bible, but his philosophy starts from it. Bardaisan, on the other hand,
appears in these controversies as a Cosmologist or Natural Philosopher with a
system of his own, who found in the Gospel, as he found in Greek philosophy,
certain things which he adopted because they seemed to be in harmony with his
own views. Mani also is a thinker, more or less independent of Biblical <i>data.
</i>Both to Bardaisan and to Mani their cosmological notions are an essential
part of their religion. But I have the impression, that Marcion was only a
cosmologist by accident, that he was essentially concerned with morals and the
working of the mind and what may be called the psychology of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Ephraim makes some telling points against him over the Voice at the
Transfiguration. Marcion, we know, had a clumsy presentation of the Universe as
consisting of three Regions, one 'above' the other. In the highest dwelt the
Kind Stranger ; <A HREF="#cxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxi</SPAN></A> in the lowest,
on the earth, was the domain of Matter ; between them, above the earth, was the
domain of the Creator or Maker, the God of Justice and Law, who had made Man out
of Matter in his own image. When the Voice came at the Transfiguration, saying,
'This is My Son,' how, says Ephraim, did they know it was the Stranger's Voice,
and not that of the God of the Law ? If it was the Stranger, speaking from the
heavens above us, how had He got there? This is a good debating point; but just
as we see how very much easier the controversy between Ephraim and Bardaisan
would have been, if they had considered Space as measured with Cartesian axes,
so I venture to think Marcion would have made his meaning clearer if he had
placed his Kind Stranger in a 'fourth dimension.'</p>
<p>The essential thing about the Kind Stranger who can and will forgive freely
is that He is not in or of this tangible and measurable world. At least this is
so, except in so far as the very notions in Marcion's mind are part of the whole
of Nature. With this proviso, the whole of Marcion's system is essentially built
upon the same lines as the religion outlined in Huxley's famous Romanes Lecture.
Nature is red in tooth and claw, in this world an eye is exacted for an eye and
a tooth for a tooth (or its equivalent). Action and reaction are equal and
opposite, and the Law of the Conservation of Energy seems to be unbroken. But
Man can imagine, more or less, another world where this is not the case, and his
mind can take refuge in this fairyland, which is outside the visible universe.</p>
<p>Marcion did not, as a matter of fact, put his thoughts in this way. He was,
as Ephraim says (p. lvii), 'half in and half out' of orthodox thought, and so
was liable to charges of inconsistency. His great merit is that he felt the
charm of the Gospel message apart from the sanction of the Old Testament.
Ephraim starts off his polemic against Marcion by appealing to the miracles of
the Exodus, and to alleged confirmations of Old Testament wonders in the
archives of Egypt and Babylon, an argument which now only raises a smile. But
Marcion's position is not similarly affected by modern discovery : the God to
Whom he gave his allegiance was always outside of this visible world, and if the
visible world has been found not to be geocentric that matters <A HREF="#cxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxii</SPAN></A>
less to him than to those whose God had His throne 'above the bright blue sky.'</p>
<p>Apart from their views about the Bible the Marcionites appear in these
treatises as an ultra-pietistic school, who fast more than Ezekiel and pray more
than Daniel. Indeed, they claim to pray all day (p. xxxi <i>med.). </i>The early
orthodox Syriac-speaking Church esteemed virginity so highly, that we need not
be surprised that Ephraim does not touch upon Marcion's rejection of Christian
marriage. According to vol. i. p. 129, l. 1 (p. xciv), the Marcionites
worshipped towards the West.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>4. <i>The System of Bardaisan.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treatises of Ephraim add little fresh to what we knew already about
Marcion and the Marcionites, but they do add greatly to our knowledge of
Bardaisan's system. So scattered and piecemeal, however, are the bits of
information which Ephraim gives us that I will begin by quoting what Moses bar
Kepha says about him.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;Bardaisan held about this world that it is composed of Five Entities (<i>Ithye</i>),
<i>viz. </i>Fire and Wind and Water and Light and Darkness. Each of these was
standing in its own region, Light in the East, Wind in the West, Fire in the
South, Water in the North, the Lord of them all in the Height, and their Enemy,
the Dark, in the Depth below. Once upon a time, whether from some external body
or by chance, they were hurled one against another, and the Dark ventured to
come up from the Depth to mingle together with them. Then the pure Entities
began to run away and flee from the Dark and appealed to the mercy of the Most
High to deliver them from the dirty colour that was mingled with them, <i>i.e. </i>from
the Dark. Then, says he, at the sound of the commotion the Word (<i>Memra</i>)
of the Intention of the Most High, which is the Christ, came down and cut off
the Dark from being in the midst of the pure Entities, and it was hurled down
and fell to the lower part of its nature, and He set <A HREF="#cxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxiii</SPAN></A>
up each of the Entities into its order in the mystery of the cross. And as for
that mixture which came into being from the Entities and the Dark their enemy,
He constituted from it this World and set it in the midst, that no further
mixture might be made from them and that which has been mixed already, while it
is being cleansed and refined by <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> conception and
birth until it is perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>Moses bar Kepha died 903 A.D.<i>, </i>more than five centuries after S.
Ephraim, but this account exactly agrees with what we read about Bardaisan's
system of the universe on pp. 214-5, so that it may be taken as substantially
accurate and used as the starting-point of our description. The most essential
feature of Bardaisan's system is that 'God' with him is not the Creator and
Source of the stuff of which the Universe is made, but the Arranger of it into
an ordered Cosmos. God is not the sole <i>Ithya, </i>the sole self-existent
Being or Entity ; besides God there are the four pure substances of Light, Wind,
Fire, and Water, and the foul Dark substance. These only make up six Entities,
while Ephraim everywhere treats Bardaisan as teaching that there are Seven <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
: it appears to me that the Seventh Entity is Space itself, concerning which
Bardaisan said that 'God is in the midst of Space' (vol. i, p. xcvii).
'Greater,' says Ephraim, 'are the praises which Bardaisan uttered concerning
Space than those which he uttered concerning the God in the midst of Space' (p.
xcvi).</p>
<p>If Space be the Seventh Entity of Bardaisan, we see the point of Ephraim's
elaborate discussion of the substantial existence of mathematical Space in the
first of the treatises edited in this volume. Ephraim comes to the conclusion
that Space is not a thing but a notion ; to Bardaisan, on the other hand, it was
a thing of limited extent,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> outside of which
nothing existed, while within it God and the Entities, good and bad, lived and
moved and had their being.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ephraim2_8_fig1.jpg" align="left" width="232" height="188">The
configuration of things before ever the world was, which is implied by Moses bar
Kepha and by Ephraim on pp. ci, cii, <A HREF="#cxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxiv</SPAN></A>
may be represented by Fig. 1. Another configuration of the system of Bardaisan
is set forth on p. cvi and in the metrical Discourse, Stanza XLVIII, p. 155, and
is represented by Fig. 2. Ephraim tries to shew that each configuration is
inconsistent with itself when used to explain the origin of our World, but he
does not complain that the two configurations are inconsistent with each other.
He is so quick to press debating points of this kind, that I think we may infer
from his silence that the two configurations were put forward by Bardaisan less
as absolute physical realities, than as presentations or diagrams explanatory of
his ideas. No doubt Bardaisan taught that God and the uncreated Entities existed
in Space before our World came into being, but the actual disposition of these
Entities must, even to a Gnostic teacher of the 2nd century, have been
conjectural. What Bardaisan was concerned to assert was that things were
originally in a happy state of equilibrium, that something occurred to disturb
this equilibrium whereby general disaster was threatened, but that God came to
the rescue and confined within certain limits the damage already done and
provided for its eventual reparation.<sup><A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> </sup>This
corresponds in a sense to the ordinary Christian doctrine of the 'Fall,' but it
differs from it inasmuch as it puts the Fall before the construction of our
World—nay more, it makes the Fall to be the cause of this World, not a
regrettable incident occurring after this World had been made. In this, as we
shall see, the Bardesanian doctrine agrees with Manichaeism : in fact, the
religion of Mani becomes more comprehensible if the ideas of Bardaisan are
recognised as one of its formative elements.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ephraim2_8_fig2.jpg" align="left" width="72" height="223">An
accusation brought three times by Ephraim against <A HREF="#cxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxv</SPAN></A>
Bardaisan is that he picked out analogies here and there where they suited his
theories, without attempting to consider the similar instances where his
theories would not work. He 'sailed about,' <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
rather like a butterfly. No doubt the philosophy of S. Ephraim is more or less
open to the same reproach, but it is likely enough that there was in Bardaisan
something of the Dilettante. I shall therefore not attempt to exhibit his
Philosophy as a system, when perhaps it never had essential coherence, but
rather pick out features of interest which can be gathered from Ephraim's very
unsympathetic refutations.</p>
<p>This world and its inhabitants having been the result of a pre-mundane
accident, it is not surprising that Bardaisan did not believe in the
resurrection of the body. Man, according to Bardaisan, is naturally mortal <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
(I) ; it was Abel, not Adam, who died first (XLI). Our Lord only raises Souls
(XCI) : if Death came from Adam's sin, our Lord ought to have rewarded His
redeemed with life in this world (II, LXXIV, LXXIX). 'He that keepeth My Word
shall not taste Death,' said our Lord, yet all have died; therefore He did not
redeem the Body (LXXX). The Body is heavier than the Soul, and not really akin
to it (I, LXI, LXV); it cannot cleave to it for ever (XLIV). The effect of
Adam's sin was to prevent Souls after death from what Bardaisan calls 'crossing
over,' while on the other hand the Life or Salvation brought by our Lord was
that He enabled the Souls to cross over into the Kingdom (LXXXII) or, as it is
elsewhere called, 'the Bridal-chamber of Light' (LXXXI, LXXXV).</p>
<p>The Body, according to Bardaisan, is incapable of thought, while the Soul is
merely ignorant; following the imagery of the Gospel Parable (Matt, xiii 33), he
says that the Leaven is the Divine faculty of Reason (<i>mad'a</i>) which God
places in the Soul, where it works by its own inherent energy till the whole
Soul becomes rational and therefore Divine (LIX, LXI). This Reason he regards as
a 'stranger' in the Soul, <i>i.e. </i>it is a gift from God, not a mere natural
development.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A><sup> <A HREF="#cxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxvi</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>Bardaisan was evidently known as 'the Aramaean Philosopher,' <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
and no one has ever questioned his command over the language and literature of
his native land. But on pp. iii—v Ephraim raises the question of his
competence in Greek philosophical literature. He says that Bardaisan has mixed
up the doctrines of Plato with those of the Stoics, which are contrary to
Plato's own teaching, naming (but not quoting) a lost work of Albinus as proving
his point. Further on (p. xxii), he accuses Bardaisan of basing his theories of
vision upon the accidents of Aramaic gender, regardless of the fact that his
analogies would not hold good in Greek. The question therefore arises : Did
Bardaisan know Greek ? Or rather, seeing that Bardaisan lived part of his life
at the court of Edessa and therefore probably could speak Greek, had he a really
first-hand knowledge of any department of Greek literature ?</p>
<p>It is difficult to say for certain ; the impression I get is that he had
little or no first-hand knowledge of Greek writings, and I venture to hazard the
conjecture that a good deal of the vaguely Hellenic air of the theories opposed
by Ephraim is due to Harmonius, the son of Bardaisan, who is said by Theodoret (<i>Haer.
</i>22) to have studied at Athens and become familiar with the language and
philosophy of Greece. Harmonius adhered to his father's doctrines ; it seems
only likely that some of the confusion between Platonic and Stoic teaching,
pointed out by Ephraim in his treatise against Bardaisan's <i>Domnus,</i><A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
may be due to the not too accurate learning of an Oriental student picked up in
a Western University.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A></p>
<p>But did S, Ephraim himself know Greek? According to the traditional <i>Life, </i>it
was an acquirement of his latest years and ascribed to miracle, and this would
fit in with the internal evidence of his genuine works, apart from the <i>Domnus
</i>treatise. After all, Ephraim gives us no quotations from Plato or the
Stoics, or even from Albinus (p. 7, 1. 9), and it is the same with the account
of <A HREF="#cxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxvii</SPAN></A> Hermetic doctrine in the
final treatise (p. xcix). There is nothing in these treatises to prevent us from
regarding the information about Greek literature and philosophy which they
contain as based on hearsay. No doubt Ephraim was pretty well informed, and he
may very likely have taken some pains to find out how far Bardaisan's statements
were to be trusted. Possibly also other Syriac writers, some of whom may have
known Greek, had done their best to controvert Bardaisan in the century and a
half which elapsed between the publication of <i>Domnus</i> and S. Ephraim's
refutations. In any case, the controversial tracts here edited do not compel us
to ascribe to Ephraim linguistic and literary acquirements which the rest of the
available evidence about him make improbable.</p>
<p>That Bardaisan really did regard things in general from a rather narrowly
Mesopotamian point of view is clear from his curious etymologies of the names of
the Months, about which Ephraim writes on p. cv. The Mesopotamian year began in
October ; the name of the first month was Teshri, and that of the second in
early times was Marheshwan.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> <i>Teshri </i>seems
to be connected with <i>sharri, </i>'to begin,' as <i>teshmeshta</i>, 'service,'
is connected with <i>shammesh</i>, 'to serve' ; <i>Marheshwan </i>might easily
suggest the Syriac word <i>rhash</i>, 'to crawl' or 'creep,' though this
derivation would not account for the final syllable. At any rate, Bardaisan
brings forward these derivations, which Ephraim controverts on the common-sense
ground that if the names of the months were significant they would all be
significant, whereas Bardaisan failed to find a plausible Syriac derivation for
Nisan, <i>i.e. </i>April, or for the months which follow.</p>
<p>We know, of course, more about ancient Kalendars than either Bardaisan or
Ephraim. The names of the Mesopotamian months, used also by the Jews after the
Exile, are Babylonian, and Marheshwan is known to be an Aramaic corruption of <i>Arah
samna, </i>'the eighth Month.' The Babylonian year began at the Vernal Equinox
with the month Nisan; while the October beginning, which put Teshri in the first
place, seems to have 'been the immemorial native Aramaean starting-point. In any
case it goes back to 312 B.C., the beginning of the Seleucid Era. <A HREF="#cxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxviii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name Marheshwan for November was dropped by the Edessenes at least as
early as the Diocletian persecution, and the first four months of the Syriac
year were called Teshri I, Teshri II, Kanon I, Kanon II, instead of Teshri,
Marheshwan, Kislew, Tebeth. It may be gathered from what Ephraim says on p. 222,
l. 34, that the old name Marheshwan was in his days only used in Beth Garmai,
i.e. in the district where Nineveh was and Mosul is.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></p>
<p>We learn, further, that the son of Bardaisan, <i>i.e. </i>almost certainly
the Harmonius referred to above, speaks of Teshri II for November, whereas his
father uses the old name Marheshwan. The extract quoted on p. 223, ll. 14-17, is
interesting on several accounts. In the first place, it is in 7-foot metre : —</p>
<p align="center"><i>O Teshri, 'emma <font face="Symbol">d</font>sha<font face="Symbol">qq</font>a,</i><br>
<i>'audle<font face="Symbol">d</font> lan Teshri hre<font face="Symbol">q</font>a</i>.<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A></p>
<p align="center">&quot;O Teshri, Mother of the Year,&nbsp;<br>
Produce for us another Teshri !&quot;</p>
<p>This is the metre in after years especially associated with S. Ephraim's own
name, and so it bears out the tradition that Ephraim took the metres, which
Harmonius is credited with having introduced into Syriac literature, and turned
them into vehicles for orthodox doctrine.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A></p>
<p>Further, Ephraim tells us that this couplet refers to the 'Mother of Life,'
asking her to produce and leave behind a daughter after her own likeness. This
is quite in the same range of thought as the short extracts from Bardaisan Hymns
quoted by Ephraim in the 55th of the Hymns against Heresies (<i>ES. </i>ii 557,
558). Those Hymns are said there to be written by the 'sons' of Bardaisan, while
this couplet about Teshri is said to be written by his 'son.' Doubtless in
either case Harmonius is meant. There is a distinct difference of atmosphere
between this poetry and the words or opinions definitely given as those of
Bardaisan himself. <A HREF="#cxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxix</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, it may be asked, is not Bardaisan known to have been a poet ? Did he not
write the Syriac poem known (in modern times) as 'The Hymn of the Soul' ? In
reply I venture to urge that one result of the texts published in these volumes
is to render any connexion of Bardaisan with any part of the 'Acts of Thomas'
improbable. As I have published two separate translations of the great Hymn from
the 'Acts of Thomas,' one of them under the name of <i>The Hymn of Bardaisan</i>,<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
a few remarks on this statement may not be out of place.</p>
<p>Even in the little<sup>1</sup> book called <i>The Hymn of Bardaisan</i> I had
stated that it was doubtful whether it was the work of Bardaisan himself (p. 4),
but I then thought it had been really made out that the Acts of Thomas were full
of 'Bardesanian' teaching. By 1904, in the book called <i>Early Eastern
Christianity, I </i>had become much less certain of this, and now after a very
careful study of these 'Refutations' of S. Ephraim it appears to me that the
doctrines of Bardaisan are altogether different from those of the Acts of
Thomas. What, then, were, the reasons which made modern scholars assume any
connexion between these schools of thought ? My friend Prof. A. A. Bevan sums up
Ephraim's accusations against Bardaisan, as known before the publication of
these treatises, under three heads:—(1) denial of the resurrection of the
body, (2) belief in a divine 'Mother,' (3) belief in eternal beings subordinate
to the supreme God. These three heresies are all present in the 'Hymn of the
Soul,' so that a presumption is created that its doctrine is Bardesanian.<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p>It may be urged on the other side with regard to (1) that it is a common
characteristic of almost all schools of early Christian thought except orthodox
Catholicism. As to (2) there is very little to connect the 'Mother' referred to
in Ephraim, <i>Ed. Rom. </i>ii. 557, with the Queen of the East in the Hymn. For
the latter a much nearer parallel is found in that passage of Aphraates (<i>Patr.
Syr. </i>i. 840<sup>12</sup>) which speaks of the Holy Spirit as a Christian's
Mother. And as to (3) the subordinate divine Powers in the Hymn, the 'Nobles'
who set their seal to the Letter of the <A HREF="#cxxx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxx</SPAN></A>
supreme 'King of Kings,' they are mere personages of the Heavenly Kingdom, the
Celestial Hierarchy, while the 'eternal beings' set by Bardaisan alongside of
God are material elements, the Light, the Wind, the Water, the Fire, and the
crude Dark Stuff that exists in the depth below. Of these, the characteristic <i>Ithye
</i>of Bardaisan, there is no trace in the Hymn of the Soul or in the rest of
the Acts of Thomas.</p>
<p>But the reason against ascribing the Hymn to Bardaisan, which seems to me
most clearly to emerge from a study of the Refutations published in this work,
is the entire absence of the mythic and poetical element in all that Ephraim
quotes from him. In these Refutations 'the Philosopher of the Aramaeans' appears
as a matter-of-fact man of science, a teacher of positive doctrine about the
physical constitution of the world in which we live. To us, no doubt, it is
science falsely so called, speculations as groundless as his derivations of the
names of the Months. But such as it is, it is positive doctrine about matter and
sense-perception ; there is no parabolic setting-forth of the meaning of human
life or the ways of Divine redemption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the attitude of Bardaisan towards life is essentially different
from that characteristic of the tale of Judas Thomas, including the great Hymn.
The Acts of Thomas sets forth a philosophy of life essentially ascetic, and
there is nothing ascetic in the attitude of Bardaisan. It is true that he
regarded man as naturally mortal, and held that only the immortal soul is
redeemed by Christ. But he did not reject marriage, as the Acts of Thomas does.
In the Hymn itself there is nothing about marriage or generation, but the food
and dress of 'Egypt' are regarded as unclean, and not merely as things temporary
and perishable.</p>
<p>I venture to think that the reason which made it even plausible to suggest
that the Hymn of the Soul came from the school of Bardaisan was the very little
positive knowledge that we possessed of the actual teachings of Bardaisan. In
the first volume of this work Mr. Mitchell, under the influence of the theory
here controverted, was at pains to point out all the references and parallels to
the Hymn of the Soul that he could find in the 'Refutations.' They are to be
found on p. lxxxix and p. cvii of vol. i. Of these, the first merely deals with
the meaning of the <A HREF="#cxxxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxi</SPAN></A> word <i>sayka
</i>as a standing epithet for a Serpent or Dragon : I willingly admit that it
must mean 'the Swallower,' not 'the Loud-breathing,' all the more because the
ancient Greek translation of the Hymn itself is now found to translate the word
by to_n<i> </i>katapo&amp;thn<i>. </i>The other passage <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
has really very little in common with the Hymn except the word <i>shabra</i>,<i>
</i>i.e. 'childish' or 'inexperienced.' Certainly Ephraim cannot be referring
directly to the Hymn in this passage, for he asks how the Soul leaves
Understanding behind, or how the Soul forgets, whereas in the Hymn this is
directly explained as the result of eating the unclean food of the Egyptians. It
is much more probable that in vol. i. p. cvii, there is no reference at all to
the Hymn, but only to that question, at all times interesting, as to how the
Soul of man can have forgotten, if it really had had a conscious pre-existence.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>5. <i>The System of Mani.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Refutations of Ephraim in the case of the doctrines of the Manichaeans,
as in the case of the Marcionites, are chiefly useful as a confirmation and a
check to our previous knowledge. The system of Mani, as it appears in these
works, is essentially the same religion that is described and controverted in
the <i>Acta Archelai </i>and by Titus of Bostra. The special value here of what
S. Ephraim has to tell us comes from his early date and the fact that he writes
in Syriac. He is only a little later than the other two authorities, and what he
reports is undistorted by the veil of Greek language and thought. Ephraim died
in 373, so that his Refutations appeared less than a century after Mani's own
death.</p>
<p>Just as we started with the account of Bardaisan by Moses bar Kepha it will
be convenient in dealing with Mani to follow the account of Theodore bar Khoni
as set forth by Cumont in <i>La Cosmogonie Manichéenne</i>,<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
because this work gives us more of the actual Syriac terms used by
Syriac-speaking Manichees than any other authority except our Refutations.</p>
<p>The Manichees taught their disciples that the first thing they had to do was
to distinguish the <i>Two Principles, </i>that is <A HREF="#cxxxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxii</SPAN></A>
to say, the Light, which is essentially Good, and the Dark, which is essentially
Evil. Or rather it would perhaps be more accurate to say that Evil arises by a
mixture of the Dark with the Light, and that when such a mixture has taken
place, progress towards a better state of things, redemption, salvation,
deliverance, is only to be obtained by straining out the Dark from the Light.
Besides the Two Principles it was further necessary to understand the <i>Three
Moments, </i>that is to say the Past, the Present, and the Future.<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
In the <i>Past, </i>the Dark and the Light were separate, but the Dark somehow
conceived a passion for the Light its opposite and made an assault upon it,
whereby a portion of the Light became mixed with the Dark, was in fact swallowed
by it : in the process of this struggle the present world and the race of men
came into being, not being wholly of the Light or of the Dark, but being
essentially mixed and therefore evil, <i>i.e. </i>incongruous. In the <i>Present
</i>the Intelligence which belongs essentially to the Light has contrived a
mechanism, whereby the Light is being gradually refined from the Dark and the
Dark confined by a wall or prison, so that never again can it overpass its
boundary. In the <i>Future</i>,<i> </i>when this refining process is completed,
all the Parts of the Light now imprisoned in Men and Animals and Plants will
have been refined away : what is left will be burnt out, so far as it is
destructible, and the remainder, being wholly of the Dark, will join the
original powers of darkness in their eternal prison.</p>
<p>The Two Principles of Light and Dark are thus alone primitive: the ultimate
cause not only of that which we see around us, but even of the hierarchy of
Light, has been the Attack made by the Dark upon the region of Light. Evil began
by Darkness desiring the Light (i. p. xxix) ; it conceived a passion for Good
and made an assault on it (i. pp. xxv, xlix, lxxviii; ii. p. xcix <i>med.</i>),<i>
</i>it felt, touched, ate, sucked, tasted, and swallowed it (i. pp. xliv,
lxxxv). Mani naturally could not explain, any more than Bardaisan could, how
this first disturbance of the eternal order took place, but he seems somewhere
to have expressed it, that it was as if the Dark from a far distance smelt and
perceived that there was 'something pleasant' beyond his region (i. p. lx).
Ephraim misses <A HREF="#cxxxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxiii</SPAN></A> the point
when he merely seizes on it to ask how the Light was far distant from the dark
when the two regions lay side by side: Mani's point is, that the beginning of
Evil is unregulated desire.</p>
<p>It will be convenient to notice here the asceticism of the Manichaean
religion, because it influences even the terms of Mani's cosmology. All
generation was to Mani doubly hateful, for it was a fresh mixture. To take life
was to cut the Parts of Light imprisoned in a living body ; to produce fresh
life was to perpetuate a state of things that ought never to have been. It was
equally wrong to sow and to reap, and the Initiates—the Righteous (<i>zaddike</i>),
as they called themselves—were not willing even to break bread lest they pain
the Light which is mixed with it (i. p. xxx), their food, as we learn from other
sources, being wholly prepared for them by mere disciples. In accordance with
this the Manichaeans appear to have avoided all words which describe the
production of the Hierarchy of Light by words like 'beget,' or even 'create.' We
hear of the Father of Greatness, and the Mother of the Living, but the Primal
Man is not styled their Son : Mani seems to have carried through the idea of the
Logos, or mere Word, as the producing organ. The Father of Greatness neither
espouses the Mother of Life nor begets the Primal Man, but calls (<font face="SPEdessa">)rq</font>)—and
they exist.<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> There is no syzygy of the Aeons in
Manicheism, as in the system of Valentinus ; Ephraim suggests a marriage of the
various elements of Light and Dark (ii. p. xcix end), but only by way of
sarcasm. When therefore the Z<SPAN class="small">IWANE</SPAN> are called 'Sons'
of the Light and the Primal Man is called their 'Father,' these words of
relation are used only in a general way to denote origin.</p>
<p>According to Theodore bar Khoni the Manichees called the <A HREF="#cxxxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxiv</SPAN></A>
ultimate Supreme Good Being [Syriac], <i>i.e. </i>'the Father of Greatness' but
neither He nor His five Attributes or Manifestations, <i>viz. </i>Intelligence,
Reason, Thought, Imagination, Intention,<sup> </sup>are mentioned as such in
Ephraim's Refutations. The 'Mother of the Living' is just named in ii. p.
xcviii. On the other hand 'the Primal Man' and his five Z<SPAN class="small">IWANE</SPAN>
come in for frequent notice. The Primal Man ([Syriac]) is not Adam, but a
Heavenly Being evoked for the purpose of repulsing the attack of the Dark upon
the realm of Light. According to Ephraim (i. p. xc) the Manichees interpreted
John i 4 as referring to this personage, but as he truly remarks the 'Greek' has
a plural (<font face="SPIonic">to_ fw~s tw~n a0nqrw&amp;pwn</font>).</p>
<p>The first combat between Light and Dark ended in the victory of the latter.
The Dark struck the Primal Man senseless and 'swallowed' his Five Z<SPAN class="small">IWANE</SPAN>.
That these were five in number is stated in i. pp. lxxix, xc, xcvii. The odd
thing is that they are never directly enumerated. From p. lxxix we learn that
four of them were Light, Wind, Water, and Fire, but what was the fifth ? Our
chief Arabic source (Flügel, <i>Fikrist, </i>p. 87) says 'the gentle breeze,' <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
the <i>Acta Archelai </i>vii says <font face="SPIonic">u3lh</font><i>. </i>There
is evidently some confusion here. Cumont, following Beausobre, thinks of a
palaeographical confusion between YLH and AHP, but if this were all it remains
curious that Ephraim never names the Air as one of the Sons of the Light.</p>
<p>The word <i>Ziwana </i>(? Brilliant) seems to have applied to others of the
heavenly Hierarchy, for Theodore speaks of Jesus the <i>Ziwana, </i>who aroused
Adam to consciousness (<i>Cumont, </i>p. 46).</p>
<p>The Manichees appear to have been unwilling to represent this all-important
combat as entirely a victory for the Dark. <A HREF="#cxxxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxv</SPAN></A>
On the one hand the Primal Man was left lying unconscious on the field and his <i>Ziwane
</i>were swallowed by the Dark, on the other both Ephraim (i. p. lxxix) and
Titus of Bostra (A 17) tell us that the <i>Ziwane </i>were used by the Primal
Man as a bait (<font face="SPIonic">de/lear</font>) to catch the Sons of the
Dark and so to return them to their own place.</p>
<p>However that may be, the result was that Light was mixed with the Dark, and
the problem then was, first, how to restrain the Sons of the Dark, and secondly,
how to separate the Light that had been mixed in them. These Sons of the Dark
were called by Manichees [Syriac] (Archons), a word which always has in Syriac
the sinister significance of a Demoniac Ruler. In vol. ii. p. xci it is twice
used in the singular of the Evil Power.</p>
<p>The Primal Man recovered from his swoon, and aided by fresh Light-powers <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
he 'hunted the Sons of the Dark and flayed them, and made this Sky from their
skins, and out of their excrement he compacted the Earth, and of their bones he
forged and raised and piled up the Mountains' (i. p. xxxiii), and he did all
this in order to strain out from them by rain and dew the 'Parts of the Light'
that had been mixed in them. According to Theodore bar Khoni this mixed material
world, composed of the parts of the Archons, who yet have particles of Light
mingled in their substance, is held in place by five heavenly powers, who are
also named in Greek and Latin sources. They are</p>

<p>Of these the [Syriac]<i> (Sabbala</i>), the Supporter, is mentioned in ii.
208<sub>39</sub> (=p. xcviii), and the <i>Splenditenens </i>in the preceding
line. Unfortunately only the latter half of the title is legible. The former
part (end of l. 37) cannot be read, but it was certainly not [Syriac] or
[Syriac]. To me it looks more like [Syriac] or [Syriac], but the fact is that
the script has perished. This is all the more <A HREF="#cxxxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxvi</SPAN></A>
provoking as the meaning of the Syriac word used by Theodore is doubtful.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A></p>
<p>The Archons being thus chained up, Theodore tells us that a certain amount of
the absorbed Light was refined out of them at once, and from it was made the Sun
and Moon and the Stars. But much yet remained in the Archons, and so a new
personage was contrived, the Messenger ([Syriac]), called also the Virgin of
Light by Ephraim, who 'manifests her beauty to the Archons, so that they long to
run after her' (i. p. lxi f.).<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> As a result, the
details of which may be studied in Cumont's Note (pp. 54-68), plants and animals
were produced on the Earth by the Archons, who, fearing to lose all the Light
they had absorbed, at last produce a new being, Adam, which they form in the
image of God, <i>i.e. </i>in the image of the Primal Man, the divine Once again
their design fails, for Jesus the <i>Zawana </i>comes, it is not explained how,
to Adam as he lies inert upon the ground. Adam looks at himself and recognises
who he is, <i>i.e. </i>that he is a being at least partly made of the Light.<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
'Jesus made him stand up and gave him to eat of the Tree of Life.<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
Then Adam looked and wept, he lifted up his voice like a roaring lion, he tore
his hair, he beat his breast, and said, &quot;Woe, woe to the creator of my
body, to him who has bound my soul to it, and to the rebels who have enslaved
me!&quot; '<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> Ephraim does not refer to this
striking passage, which Cumont regards as the actual peroration of the <i>Epistula
Fundamenti, </i>one of the most widely read writings of Mani.</p>
<p>So much for the <i>Past. </i>In the <i>Present, </i>according to Mani, a
great mechanism has been contrived for refining out of the world what is left of
the Parts of the Light that had been absorbed: the arrangement of this mechanism
was in fact the salvation <A HREF="#cxxxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxvii</SPAN></A>
brought by Jesus, when He came on earth and those that saw Him supposed
erroneously that He was really a man.<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> By it the
Light that is separated out is conveyed to the Moon, whereby it waxes for
fifteen days, and then when full discharges its load of Light for another
fifteen days into the Sun.</p>
<p>The Pillar of Glory ([Syriac]) is named in ii. 208, 1. 37 (=p. xcviii), the
only place where the original Syriac term is known to occur. This 'Pillar' is
either the way up to the Moon, as the Fihrist seems to imply, or that in which
redeemed souls wait till all is fulfilled, as is stated in the <i>Acta Archelai.
</i>In either case the Manichees appear to have meant by it the Milky Way. It is
also called in the <i>Acta Archelai </i>the Perfect Man, <i>Vir perfectus. </i>Epiphanius
changes <font face="SPIonic">a0nh&amp;r</font><i> </i>into <font face="SPIonic">a0h&amp;r</font><i>,
</i>but thereby the imagery is spoilt, for it is evidently taken from Eph. iv 13
(<font face="SPIonic">ei0s a1ndra te/leion</font>) : the redeemed souls are
collected in the Pillar of Glory till all the particles of the absorbed Light
have been refined out of the substance of the Archons and the Primal Man is
perfect again.<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A></p>
<p>The most potent agents in refining out the Light are, of course, the fully
initiated disciples of Mani, but exactly how they did it cannot be ascertained
from S. Ephraim, for obvious reasons. It is not very difficult to be sarcastic
with this part of the Manichaean system, and Ephraim takes advantage of most of
the obvious openings. What is more interesting is the very small number of the
highest class of Initiates, the K<SPAN class="small">PHALPALE</SPAN> ([Syriac],
ii. 205<sup>7</sup>, 206<sup>27</sup>). In the first of these passages Ephraim
speaks of Five, in the second of a Pair, which perhaps means much the same
thing. Certainly these personages were able to give all their time to their
mysterious work, for there was very little else that it was permitted to a fully
initiated Manichee to do. They might neither take life nor produce it, whether
animal or vegetable, so that agriculture and cooking were as much taboo as
murder and aiultery. In i. p. xciii Ephraim depicts the initiate Manichee women,
the Z<SPAN class="small">ADDIKATIIA</SPAN>, as sitting idle from religious
motives. It is curious to hear a fellow-countryman of S. Alexius and S. Simeon
Stylites rebuking the unworldly inactivities of the Manichees! <A HREF="#cxxxviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxviii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, as may be seen from the peroration of the Hypatius Discourses,
the lives of the Manichaean devotees must have been spent in a manner not unlike
that of the 'Sons of the Covenant' and other Christian ascetics of the East:
'their works are like our works, as their fast is like our fast' (i. p. cxix).
No doubt they spent a good deal of their time in transcribing and ornamenting
their sacred writings, as may be gathered from S. Augustine and from the remains
of very handsome MSS. dug up in Turfan in Central Asia. In this they were
followers of Mani himself, who 'painted in colours on a scroll the likenesses of
the wickednesses which he created out of his mind' (i. p. xciii).</p>
<p>As to the <i>Future, </i>the Manichees, like the Christians, looked forward
to a victorious end of the present state of things. When all the Parts of the
Light have been refined out of the base material, Evil, which is the result of
the mixture of Light and Dark, will have disappeared. The Earth of Light
([Syriac]), in which God dwells and which is itself Divine (i. pp. lviii, lix,
xcvi), will be complete and inviolate, and the powers of the Dark will be
confined inside their own domain, round which BAN, the Heavenly Builder, has now
built a wall and fence, to be the Grave of the Darkness for ever (i. pp. xxx,
xlvi, lxxv).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such are the main outlines of the system of Mani, on almost every part of
which the Refutations of S. Ephraim throw a certain amount of fresh light. This
is not the place to attempt a critical study of the sources and connexions of
this fantastic Religion, that had in spite of almost continual persecution so
long and sometimes so victorious a career. I shall only bring forward one point,
on which the Refutations curiously confirm the evidence of the <i>Acta Archelai,
</i>of Titus of Bostra, and of Evodius, as its elucidation seems to have an
important bearing upon the origin of Mani's stock of ideas.</p>
<p>Evodius, the friend and correspondent of S. Augustine, tells us (<i>De Fid.
c. Manich. </i>5) that the Manichees taught that the Souls which deliberately
preferred Darkness to Light and the sensual life to redemption will remain for
ever conjoined with matter in the region of the Dark. Such souls, together with
the rest of the Dark substance from which all the Light has been extracted, will
<A HREF="#cxxxix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|cxxxix</SPAN></A> be compacted together in a
great round Clod (<i>globus</i>). Titus of Bostra tells us the same,<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
and the same doctrine is set forth in the <i>Acta Archelai </i>x, the original
Greek of which, as quoted by Epiphanius, speaks of the evil man as being for
ever <font face="SPIonic">dedeme/nos ei0s th_n bw~lon</font><i>. </i>In
agreement with all this we read at the end of the Third Discourse to Hypatius
(i. p. 87, 1. 35 ff.) : <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> 'How do they say that
some of these Souls who have sinned much and done much wickedness and blasphemed
much and have been guilty of great unbelief, those which are found like dregs in
the midst of that which they call BOLOS, as they say, that when the Fire
dissolves all, within it is collected every thing that is mixed and mingled in
created things from the Lights, and &quot;those souls who have done much
wickedness are assigned to the realm of the Darkness when it is tortured.&quot;
'</p>
<p>It is clear from all these testimonies that the Manichees not only held this
doctrine, but that they called this mass of burning filth the BOLOS, a word
which is not Syriac at all, but the Greek for 'a clod.' <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A></p>
<p>Alexander of Lycopolis, himself a heathen, treats Manichaeanism as a New
Christianity. This view of it has been unpopular in recent years, for modern
scholars have preferred to see in it a more or less independent Oriental
Religion, and have tended to consider the form of it which spread to the West
and to which Augustine was for so many years a convert as an adaptation fitted
to a land where Catholic Christianity had become the established religion. But
the name of the <i>Bolus</i>, now<i> </i>attested in the Syriac of Ephraim,
cannot have come from anything but a Greek source. It suggests to us that Mani
drew his inspiration from the West as much as, if not more than, from the East
around him.</p>
<p>And the Bolus does not stand alone. That Mani did call himself the
'Paraclete' is confirmed by Ephraim (ii. p. 209<sup>11</sup>),<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
but <A HREF="#clx"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clx</SPAN></A> this term, though Greek, would
have been taken by him from the Syriac Bible. More to our purpose is the fact
that the Receivers of the Light, <i>i.e. </i>the Sun and Moon, called [Syriac]
in i. 20<sup>42</sup>=p. xxviii, are elsewhere called [Syriac] (i. 15<sup>43</sup>=p.
xxxvi, i. 28<sup>6</sup>=p. xlii), <i>i.e.</i> <font face="SPIonic">u9pode/ktai</font>,<i>
</i>a word not very common in literature, the only meaning given for it in
Sophocles' <i>Lexicon </i>being 'receivers of taxes.' <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
Here again, therefore, a Manichee technical term is taken from the Greek.</p>
<p>HYLE, <i>i.e</i>. <font face="SPIonic">u3lh</font><i>, </i>is another Greek
term which according to Ephraim is used by all three of the systems which he is
controverting, but it is only really prominent in Marcion's terminology (i. pp.
lxiii, xcix, c') and, if it was really used by the Manichees in the East, it was
no doubt borrowed by them from the Marcionites or the Bardesanians.<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A></p>
<p>Perhaps the truest idea of the direction of Mani's thought may be gathered
from the titles of his seven chief works, catalogued for us by An-Nadim.<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
Five of these, the Mysteries, the Giants, the Precepts, the Treasure (and we may
add the Living Gospel, omitted by An-Nadim), tell us nothing. One, the
Shapurakan, was composed in Persian for the benefit of Sapor the Sasanian
Monarch, but the seventh, which Alfaric identifies with the <i>Epistula
Fundamenti, </i>bore the Greek title of <font face="SPIonic">Pragmatei/a</font><i>.</i></p>
<p>Whether Mani himself knew Greek is another matter. If we have been right in
calling in question Bardaisan's first-hand knowledge of Greek literature it will
not be likely that Mani the Babylonian had much real acquaintance with genuine
Greek books or thought. What I have in view is the question whether the system
of Mani is to be thought of as a form of Oriental Religion which took on a
Christian veneer in the Catholic West, or as a peculiar and eclectic Christian
Gnosticism. The Greek terms to which I have here called attention appear to me
to shew that the non-Oriental, Western, element in Mani's system is much larger
than the scholars of the last sixty years have tended to admit.</p>
<p>In particular I cannot agree with the Swedish scholar <A HREF="#clxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxi</SPAN></A>
Dr. Gillis Wetter in his attempt to represent Manicheism, apart from the
personal influence of Mani, as a sort of offshoot of the Mandaean religion.<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
Brandt is on the contrary of opinion that 'in the verifiable parallels the
Mandaean versions seem to be secondary,' and says further : &quot;The religious
teachings of the two faiths, however, were essentially distinct in character ;
the fundamental dualism of the Manichaean system—a doctrine that finds a
soteriological design even in the creation of the world, and involves an ascetic
mode of life—is far removed from the Mandaean view' (<i>E.R.E., </i>MANDAEANS,
§ 18). On the other hand Dr. Wetter is doubtless right in laying emphasis on
the personal influence of Mani himself, the Prophet of his own new Religion.<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
The missionary impulse, maintained over two hundred years, the notable
steadfastness in danger and persecution, which characterise the Manichees, prove
that their bizarre and unscientific theology was to them in some respects a
satisfaction of their needs, a way of salvation from the perplexities of this
painful world. And if history has any general lesson to teach us about new
Religions, it is that they arise when a system or view of the world, which is
not too far away from popular aspiration, is combined with a forceful and
attractive personality.</p>
<p>Much, therefore, in the initial success of the new Religion depended on Mani
himself. And much in the new Religion appealed at once to human religious
instincts. It is natural to wish to be a son of the Light. Children cry in the
Dark, and 'a pleasant thing it is to behold the sun,' even in sultry
Mesopotamia. Moreover Mani seemed to his followers to have explained what the
old religions which had gone before him had only hinted at. But beyond these
generalities the philosophy which underlies the whole structure has even now a
certain appeal, still perceptible through its fantastic barbarian trappings. The
Religion of Mani does explain the presence of Evil in the world we live in, and
it does combine practical pessimism with ultimate optimism—perhaps the most
favourable atmosphere for the religious sentiment. It is true that the Manichees
regarded the world we live in as the result of a regrettable accident, so that
no <A HREF="#clxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxii</SPAN></A> true improvement is
possible till it is altogether abolished. As regards this world they are frankly
pessimistic : it was bad to begin with, and it will go from bad to worse. But
they believed that Light was really greater and stronger than the Dark, that in
the end all that was good in their essence would be collected in the domain of
Light, a realm altogether swayed by Intelligence, Reason, Mind, good
Imagination, and good Intention; and though at the same time there would always
exist another region, dark, and dominated by unregulated Desire, it would only
be peopled by beings for whom such a region was appropriate, and they would be
separated off for ever from invading the region of Light and so producing
another Smudge, such as our present world essentially is, according the
Manichean view.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Religion of Mani can hardly be comprehended as a heresy from
orthodox Catholicism in the sense that Monophysitism, or Arianism, or Montanism,
or even Marcion's religion, are 'heresies.' If Arianism be the brother of
Catholicism, the Manichean religion is at most a cousin. And Ephraim's
Refutations go far to shew that the connecting links are the philosophy of
Bardaisan and the organisation of the Marcionites. In common with the
Marcionites the followers of Mani were organised as a community of unmarried
ascetics with a recognised penumbra of adherents, who supported and maintained
them. The orthodox in the Euphrates Valley seem to have organised themselves in
Ante-Nicene times on much the same way, but as soon as the Government of the
Roman Empire became Christian the Syriac-speaking Church followed the customs of
the West, and the <i>Bnai Kyama </i>became an order within the Church instead of
its rank and file. But to the Marcionites and to the Manichees the monastic
constitution was essential, as it is to the Buddhists further East.<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
From the Marcionites also Mani may very well have derived his rejection of the
authority of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The relation of the thought of Mani to Bardaisan is even closer, as will have
appeared even in this slight sketch of their <A HREF="#clxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxiii</SPAN></A>
respective doctrines. In fact we learn from the Fihrist (Flügel, p. 102) that
the very first chapter of Mani's <i>Book of the Mysteries </i>was concerned with
the Daisanites, <i>i.e. </i>the followers of Bardaisan. With Bardaisan Mani
shares the concepts of the attack by the primordial Dark upon the Pure elements
of Light, Wind, Fire, and Water, the control of the damage done by the Good God,
and a plan for the eventual redemption of souls from the power of the Dark
element.</p>
<p>It has been said of a prominent English statesman that his mind fastens on
images and banns concepts : I fancy that this is the difference between Mani and
Bardaisan. Bardaisan's cosmology is a conflict of forces, Mani's is a drama
enacted by a crowd of supernatural persons. Mani, and (so far as we know) Mani
alone, excogitated the <i>Splenditenens, </i>the monstrous story of the
androgynous Virgin of Light, and the fantastic explanation of the waxing and
waning of the Moon. The odd thing is that it should have found so much credence,
not only in the immediate time and place of Mani the Founder, but even in the
far West for a time and for so many centuries in Central Asia.</p>
<p>No doubt the religion of Mani shews many signs of its strictly Babylonian
origin. The mere fact that the special region of Evil was placed in it towards
the south shews that its home was an over-hot country. No doubt also many
features in it are akin to Persian or even to old-Babylonian religion and never
had their counterparts in Greek thought, whether Christian or Pagan.
Nevertheless the 'Christian' element remains fundamental. This is clear above
all from the important role played in Manicheanism by the creation or formation
of Adam and Eve. The Manichee myth is quite different from the story in Genesis,
but it is founded upon that story. Mani, like Marcion, rejected the Book of
Genesis—which is only another way of saying that his system of thought had
been profoundly influenced by it. But Genesis and all the lore connected with
Genesis came to Mani from the West, from the Greek-speaking lands, or, as in the
case of that which he took from Bardaisan, from sources profoundly influenced by
Greek thought, Christian and Heathen.</p>
<p>To conclude this Essay, let me quote the very weighty judgement of Professor
Alfaric upon the religion of Mani and its <A HREF="#clxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxiv</SPAN></A>
literature (<i>Les Écritures Manichéennes, </i>i. 128) : 'The Persian, Arab,
and Chinese authors who have written upon the Manichees supply what is lacking
in their Latin, Greek, and Syriac predecessors. They generally speak in more
direct terms about the Manichean works quoted, because they are less afraid of
their diffusion, and being less earnest in their polemics they give us a more
objective view. Moreover some of them, such as An-Nadim and Al-Biruni, have in
any case more historic sense than Hegemonius (the reputed author of the <i>Acta
Archelai</i>),<i> </i>Epiphanius or even Augustine. But they know very little
about Christianity, and they do not take much interest in doctrines which are
derived from it. Thus they are apt to pass over specifically Christian details
in Manicheism which belong to the Bible, and to throw into high relief the
reminiscences of pagan mythology which interested them more, thereby giving a
false idea of the Manichean literature.'</p>

<p>At the time of the making of the Palimpsest foll. 42 and 45, 80 and 87, must
have been refolded, so that what had been the inner pages became outer pages.</p>
<p>Headlines on the 5th and 10th versos of each ancient Quire, e.g. [Syriac]
fol. 37a (= VI. 5), and [Syriac]<i> </i>fol. 57a (= IX. 5). &quot;When therefore
we find [Syriac] on fol. 4a. we must infer that it is the 5th leaf of Quire XI,
which therefore has lost two leaves. Similarly Quire I of Add. 14574 has lost
one leaf, the text beginning on the verso <A HREF="#clxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|clxvii</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>of what would have been I. 2. No doubt there was a blank guard-leaf at
the beginning, now torn off; probably there was as much at the end. What is lost
therefore is most likely not more than one or two pages of text, possibly only a
few lines.<br>

<p>[<i>Short lacunae are indicated in the translation by dots, and longer gaps
by asterisks, but in neither case is the number of the dots or asterisks
intended to bear any exact relation to the number of the missing words. In
respect to this an approximately correct inference may be drawn by consulting
the Syriac text.</i></p>
<p><i>Double inverted commas mark quotations where the original has </i>[Syriac]</p>
<p><i>Single inverted commas are used in numerous cases where the words seem to
be quotations or to belong to a special terminology.</i></p>
<p><i>Words in italics inside square brackets are to be regarded as conjectural
translations or paraphrases.</i></p>
<p><i>In a few passages, where the text has suffered great mutilation, italics
indicate an attempt to summarise the argument from suggestions in the fragments.</i>]</p>

<p><A NAME="#3"></A>3.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> On this subject see the remarkable
catena of passages, brought forward in illustration of Milton's <i>Paradise
Regained </i>iv 397—400, by J. E. B. Mayor in the <i>Journal of Philology </i>LVI,
pp. 289—292 (1903). To S. Basil the Darkness was an evil Power, but to S.
Augustine, as to S. Ephraim, it was only the absence of Light.</p>

by J. M. Schmid (Vienna, 1900), pp. 172-178, 204-5 <font color="#FF0000">[German

found in Petermann's <i>Grammar and Chrestomathy, </i>pp. 14-17.</p>
<p><A NAME="#5"></A>5.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> See, for instance, vol. i. p. xc.</p>
<p><A NAME="#6"></A>6.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> No distinction is made in the Syriac
Old Testament between the various spellings of the name Joshua in Hebrew (<i>Yehoshua',
Yeshua'</i>).</p>
<p><A NAME="#7"></A>7.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Ephraim's argument is : &quot;'Eve,'
says the Apostle, 'shall be saved because of her progeny' : well, then, the
'Creator' will be saved because of the Souls which owed their origin to Him
!&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#8"></A>8.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <font face="SPEdessa">ml</font>
corresponds exactly to 'inverted commas,' but unfortunately there is no
corresponding word or sign to mark the ends of quotations.</p>
<p><A NAME="#9"></A>9.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Text and Translation given in F. Nau's <i>Bardesanes
</i>(Patrologia Syriaca I, vol. ii, p. 513-515).</p>
<p><A NAME="#10"></A>10.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Read <font face="SPEdessa">dOB</font><i>

<p><A NAME="#12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> &quot;Space is measurable and holds
so much,&quot; p. 16, 1. 33-35 (=p. vii).</p>
<p><A NAME="#13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> See the Bardesanian Dialogue <i>De
Fato, </i>ad fin. (<i>Patr. Syriaca, </i>ii 611), where stress is laid on the
regulation (<i>tukkana</i>) of the Elements or Natures, and their mixture (<i>muzzaga</i>)
in this present Cosmos, whereby their primordial vehemence is mitigated.</p>
<p><A NAME="#14"></A>14.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Pp. 48, 221, 224.</p>
<p><A NAME="#15"></A>15.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> The numbers refer to the Stanzas in
the Metrical Discourse.</p>
<p><A NAME="#16"></A>16.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> In the <i>De Fato </i>(col. 572, 11.
6-9) Man is regarded as being composed of Reason (or mental Faculty), of Soul,
and of Body. Here <i>mad'e </i>is used in the plural.</p>
<p><A NAME="#17"></A>17.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> So p. 225, l. 25 : on p. 8, l. 1, the
title is 'Philosopher of the Aramaeans.'</p>
<p><A NAME="#18"></A>18.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> See p. iii. f.</p>
<p><A NAME="#19"></A>19.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Epiphanius, <i>Haer. </i>477,
represents Bardaisan as skilled both in Syriac and Greek, but that seems to come
from his mistaken idea that the <i>De Fato </i>is a Greek original, not a
translation from the Syriac.</p>
<p><A NAME="#20"></A>20.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <font face="SPIonic">Marsouanhs</font>,<i>
</i>Josephus, <i>Ant. </i>i. 3, 3.</p>
<p><A NAME="#21"></A>21.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Teshri, in Babylonian Tashritum, ia
really derived from a root akin to <i>sharri</i>, 'to begin,' but it seems to
mean 'Dedication,' not 'beginning.' In any case it was only the seventh month of
the Babylonian Year.</p>
<p><A NAME="#22"></A>22.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> I here use Greek letters for the
aspirated sounds.</p>
<p><A NAME="#23"></A>23.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Sozomen, <i>H.E. </i>iii 16. Ephraim
says of Bardaisan himself that 'he brought in measures' ([Syriac] <i>ES. </i>ii
554A), but Harmonius may very well have been the first to introduce strict
scansion.</p>
<p><A NAME="#24"></A>24.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Essex House Press, 1899. The other
translation is in <i>Early Eastern Christianity, </i>1904, a revised form of
which will be found, in THE QUEST, vol. v. (July, 1914).</p>
<p><A NAME="#25"></A>25.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> See Bevan, <i>The Hymn of the Soul, </i>p.
5.</p>
<p><A NAME="#26"></A>26.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> See the Corrigenda in this volume to
vol. i. p. 158.</p>
<p><A NAME="#27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Recherches sur le Manichéisme par
Franz Cumont, I. <i>La Cosmogonie Manichéenne d'après Théodore bar Khôni, </i>Brussels,
1908 (cited as <i>Cumont</i>).</p>
<p><A NAME="#28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> On the Two Principles and the Three
Moments, see P. Alfaric, <i>Les Écritures Manichéennes, </i>ii. 66 f.</p>
<p><A NAME="#29"></A>29.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <i>Cumont, </i>p. 14, has practically
this explanation. H. Pognon, <i>Coupes de Khouabir, </i>p. 185, note 1, points
out that <font face="SPEdessa">)rq</font> for ' create ' occurs also in Mandaean
writings, and is inclined to see in it a dialectical peculiarity, but it seems
to me that this use of the word 'to call,' instead of <font face="SPEdessa">)rB</font>
or <font face="SPEdessa">dlw)</font>, is due to theological and philosophical
tendencies, not to dialect. W. Brandt is evidently of the same opinion, for he
says (<i>E.R.E., </i>art. MANDAEANS, § 9) : &quot;The word [Hebrew], 'call,' as
used for 'call into being,' can be traced to the Biblical Genesis.&quot; This <font face="SPEdessa">)rq</font>
is translated <i>evoquer </i>by Cumont : the <i>Acta Archelai </i>used <font face="SPIonic">proba&amp;llein</font>.<i>
</i>This Manichee term is also attested by An-Nadim (Flügel's <i>Mani, </i>p.
65, l. 5).</p>
<p><A NAME="#30"></A>30.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> [???] Augustine<i> (c. Faust, </i>ii
3) seems to have had <i>aer : </i>see Flügel's <i>Mani, </i>p. 213.</p>
<p><A NAME="#31"></A>31.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> These (<i>Cumont, </i>p. 20) are the
Friend of the Lights, the Great Ban, and the Living Spirit. Of these only Ban is
mentioned by S. Ephraim (i. pp. xxx, xlvii, lxxv).</p>
<p><A NAME="#32"></A>32.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The Greek and the Latin terms must
surely represent the general meaning, all the more as one of the chief functions
of <i>Splenditenens </i>is to hold the world suspended, like a chandelier. It
seems to me probable that <font face="SPEdessa">tpc</font> must be an adaptation
of the Assyrian <i>sabit </i>(Assurnazirpal, for instance, calls himself <i>sabit
liti, </i>'holder of hostages'). Compare also the Jewish Aramaic [Hebrew],
'tongs.'</p>
<p><A NAME="#33"></A>33.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> The Virgin of Light is named also in
ii. 208, 1. 44.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="#34"></A>34.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> <i>Cumont, </i>p. 46 f.</p>
<p><A NAME="#35"></A>35.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> According to the <i>Acta Archelai </i>x
Jesus was Himself the Tree of Life. But the text may not be sound.</p>
<p><A NAME="#36"></A>36.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> <i>Cumont, </i>p. 48 f.</p>
<p><A NAME="#37"></A>37.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <i>Acta Archelai </i>viii.</p>
<p><A NAME="#38"></A>38.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> It should be noted that the belief
that the Spirits of the Just live on in the Milky Way is Stoic : see <i>Somnium
Scipionis </i>(circa med.).</p>
<p><A NAME="#39"></A>39.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <i>Tit. Bost. </i>A 41 : the sinful
souls . . . <font face="SPIonic">e0n th~| bw&amp;lw| e0mpagh&amp;sasqai a3ma
th~| kaki/a le/gwn</font><i>.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="#40"></A>40.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Mr. Mitchell's translation, p. lxxii,
should be corrected and note <sup>1</sup> deleted.</p>
<p><A NAME="#41"></A>41.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> So little is <font face="SPEdessa">swlwB</font>
a Syriac word that the ancient Syriac version of Titus of Bostra (made before
411 A.D.) transliterates it in the form <i>bolara </i>(T.B. 31<sup>16</sup>).</p>
<p><A NAME="#42"></A>42.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Naturally this only means 'I am the
one that Jesus in the Gospel said would come,' not 'I am the Holy Spirit' : see
Flügel's <i>Mani, </i>note <sup>56</sup>.</p>
<p><A NAME="#43"></A>43.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> It occurs in this sense in <i>Fayum
Towns Papyri, </i>No. cxliii.</p>
<p><A NAME="#44"></A>44.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> It seems to me possible that <font face="SPIonic">u3lh</font><i>
</i>was used by Greek-speaking Manichees as an equivalent for the Syriac <i>heshshoxa,
</i>the elemental Dark.</p>
<p><A NAME="#45"></A>45.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Flügel's <i>Mani, </i>p. 72 f.</p>
<p><A NAME="#46"></A>46.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Gillis Pison Wetter, <i>Phos </i>(Uppsala,
1914), pp. 106-120.</p>
<p><A NAME="#47"></A>47.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> <i>Ibid., </i>p. 112.</p>
<p><A NAME="#48"></A>48.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> There is no tangible evidence that
Mani derived any part of his system from Buddhist sources. No doubt his
missionaries represented their message as the true Buddhism, just as in
Christian lands they represented their message as the true Christianity.</p>
