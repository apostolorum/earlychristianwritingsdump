<hr>

<p align="left">This collection of material from Syriac sources was assembled by
William Cureton from the Nitrian desert manuscripts.&nbsp; The 'Apology of
Melito' is now considered spurious, and the production of a later age.</p>

<p align="left">I have omitted almost all the Greek and Syriac with which the
work is liberally studded.&nbsp; Most of the notes are philological, many
concerned with highlighting how mistaken Renan or B. Harris Cowper ('B.H.C.')
were in their translations of some of this material.&nbsp; I have omitted almost
all of those.&nbsp; Selected notes, or portions of them, have been moved from
the end to the foot of the work to which they relate.&nbsp; The Greek of
Bardesan, quoted from the Praeparatio Evangelica, I have omitted; likewise the
Latin of Caesarius.&nbsp; The reason for omission is that I would have to
manually transcribe the material, character by character, and I do not know of
any online readers to whom it would be of sufficient interest to justify so many
days labour.</p>
