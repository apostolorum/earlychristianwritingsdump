<hr>
<hr>
<p>In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, one God, we begin
to write, with the help and assistance of God, the story of king Zeno and his
wife Shams al-Munir and the chosen Hilaria their daughter. May their prayer and
blessings be with us. Amen.</p>
<p>There was a faithful king and his name was Zeno. He and his wife were
honourable, just and merciful in their life like our noble father and mother
Abraham and Sara and like the chosen Isaac and Rebecca, going the way of our
father Jacob and Rachel, the Ancients. They were of honourable origin, but they
had sorrow in this world because they were barren and had no child nor heir to
govern towns and cities after their decease.</p>
<p>One day, by the working of the grace of the Lord Christ, who loveth mankind
(honour and praise to him for ever. Amen.) they conceived a plan and they spoke
one to the other: &quot;Let us take a part of this money and go to the desert
and the monasteries and to the temples of God and to the caverns and
mountain-caves and to the clefts which are beneath the earth in darkness
..........<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>) who are bound, in a way pleasing to <A NAME="p66"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|66</SPAN></A>
God, by their own will, who are nourished and whose thirst is quenched, and who
are all provided for by our Lord Jesus Christ, every one according to his wish
and need; let us request them to stand before Christ and to pray for us; perhaps
God will grant us a child whereby we shall be consoled for the rest of our
lifetime.</p>
<p>So they went with zeal and warm faithfulness and with tears which flowed so
as to soak their garments and with sighs which would remove mountains, partly on
account of their sins and partly from longing for offspring. They reached the
venerable places and attained their end by the power of Christ, for the sincere
faithfulness that was in their heart. Then they returned to their appartments
with joy and gladness.</p>
<p>After the completion of a certain number of days Shams al-Munir perceived
[that she was pregnant]. She said to the faithful king Zeno: &quot;My husband,
rejoice; by the grace of the Lord and the prayers of the Fathers I perceive that
I am pregnant&quot;. Then he thanked God and began to show the monasteries and
the poor still more mercy and care; till the blessed bore a girl whose beauty
was not equalled in her time. Seven days afterwards she was baptized and called
Hilaria, the fruit of prayer, and he <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>) used to call
her by this name.</p>
<p>When she had grown up and had come to years of discretion, her father built
for her a pavilion and a beautiful appartment, the most beautiful of his
country. And he sent [someone] to ask and to search in the whole town for a
chaste, pious, learned woman, able to read the holy Scriptures. When she was
brought into the presence of <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A> the
king and the queen and they spoke to her, she answered in the best manner. Then
they praised and thanked God for granting them their wish. Then king Zeno took
the hand of his daughter and they entrusted her to her governess, in order to
teach her good demeanour and science and reading, that her intellect might shine
and her demeanour be beautiful. The chaste woman received [her] with gladness
and great joy, kissed the feet of the king and the queen, took the hand of the
chosen [maid] and went away confiding in God. He <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>)
sent with them two blessed old men to wait at the door, and food and drink and
servants and utensils, suiting to royal rank. Every fifth day the king took the
queen and they visited their daughter, the fruit of prayer, and the joy of their
heart.</p>
<p>In this blessed state and good demeanour she stayed for six years; then
Christ would lead her to perfection. She used to read in the stories of the
martyrs and the narratives of the saints which had reached perfection in the
desert. Then her heart thirsted and she loved them warmly and longed for
dwelling with and amongst them. So she began to fast, to pray and to observe
vigils and to shed tears, the beginning of every [spiritual] gift and of
remission of sins. But her beauty began to wither. Her governess observed her
and said to her: &quot;My daughter, I see thy beauty withered.&quot; She made an
obeisance for her and said: &quot;[This is caused] by my longing for meeting the
saints and living amongst them. My heart is thirsting vehemently after seeing
them; I hope that thy venerable person will hide me from my <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A>
father and mother. All food, which is brought, I shall, give to the poor;
perhaps God will open for us a way to the desert by their prayers&quot;. In this
state she remained for a year. As she withered her parents observed her and said
to her: &quot;Our daughter, blood of our hearts, we find thee withering in a
vehement way and we are sorry for thy sake; is there not a secret sorrow which
thou revealest not to us?&quot; She smiled and said: &quot;What sorrow can he
have, who enjoyeth such honour, who hath so many servants, and whose parents
converse with him? Be good to me, that I may lead this agreeable life in your
shadow&quot;. So she comforted their heart by her words; they rejoiced when she
spoke to them in this way; they took leave from her, kissed her and said to her:
&quot;Remain in peace&quot;. They greeted also her governess and went to their
castle and court.</p>
<p>When the chosen [maid] perceived that they observed her she feared they would
thwart her and her work would be idle; so she stood the whole night praying and
shedding tears like rain; she beseeched God to save and liberate her according
to His will and good pleasure. The next morning her governess came to her. They
greeted one another and the chosen Hilaria took a golden dinar and gave it her
governess, saying: &quot;I request thee to buy for me to day a monk's
habit&quot;. She went to the porter and said to him: &quot;Run and buy for this
dinar a cowl and a mantle and a habit, which must be worn out&quot;. He went and
brought her what she had commanded; she took it and went to the chosen maid who
took it with joy and gladness. They wept together till their garments were
soaked by tears. Then they took leave from one another. Hilaria, the <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A>
pure, said to her governess: &quot;From to day till after three days visit me
not, in order that, if they ask thee, thou mayest swear sincerely: &quot;I know
not where she hath gone to, nor at what time she hath departed&quot;. She
accepted her command and this was an achievance from God, strong is His name,
exalted His praise.</p>
<p>She rose in the midst of the night and departed confiding in God, reciting
psalms and praises and sanctifications to Our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom may be
glory and praise. He sent her the angel of grace and protected her wholly
against the animals and the children of man, till she arrived at Suk Misr <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>).
While she passed she saw a monk who was going his way, his head bent. She went
up to him and saluted him. He answered her salutation. Then she began to ask him
about the way of living of the monks in the desert and as to which monastery was
the first to be reached and what its name was. He informed her about their whole
way of living and said: &quot;The first monastery thou wilt reach is that of Abu
Macarius; therein are three hundred monks; part of them feedeth upon grass like
the beasts; another part fasteth one, two or three days and [then] eateth some
bread; part of them sleepeth not and all are, according to Christ's good
pleasure, standing night and day&quot;. She said to him: &quot;Pray over me and
give me thy prayer <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>), that I may reach them and
dwell amongst them&quot;. Then they prayed over one another and went their way
both of them.</p>
<p>She went, confiding in God, barefoot, on the thorns <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A>
and pebbles and thistles till the blood ran from her feet and the sun had burnt
her skin and her beauty had faded away and she had become like an Abessinian.
When she reached the gate of the monastery by the grace of Christ, she knocked
and the porter came and opened the door saying: &quot;What is thy wish, my
brother?&quot; He <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>) answered: &quot;To dwell with
your holiness, if it please Christ&quot;. He said: &quot;Stay here, my brother,
till I shall have informed the prior of the monastery.&quot;</p>
<p>He went and informed the prior of the monastery; then the prior of the
monastery came to Hilaria, the chosen. When he came near her she rose towards
him, made an obeisance and saluted and kissed his feet and his hands. He
embraced her and said: &quot;Blessed be thy coming to us, my child; by thy
prayer God may protect our monastery from Satan&quot;. Then he <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>)
sobbed and wept. The prior of the monastery began to interrogate him saying:
&quot;From where art thou, my lord, and what is thy country and thy family?
Inform me truly about</p>
<p>thy coming and all thy affairs&quot;. He answered: &quot;My name is John the
eunuch. I know neither father nor mother other than the Lord who created me. I
was the slave of a king. When he was at the point of death he freed me.
Meditating I said to myself: &quot;The service of the children of man and of
earthly kings is nothing in comparison with [the service] of the king of heaven
and earth&quot;. Then I went confiding in God, bought this garment from a monk,
changed my dress, till I came under the feet of your holiness, our Father. I
request <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A> from your holiness to guide
me by your excellency and bounty.</p>
<p>Then grace came down <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>) upon the prior of the
monastery and he knew that he <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>) was one of the
Lord's chosen. He put before him food and water to drink after the hot journey.
Then he ordered the wooden gong to be rung and all the brethren assembled, three
hundred in number. They brought water and washed his feet and drank the water in
order to obtain a blessing. Then they put on him the holy habit, glory on glory
and honour on honour <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>), and grace came down upon
him and upon the whole monastery. When they looked upon him joy and gladness
increased among them. They gave him a cell that he might perform his works as he
liked; whereupon he prostrated himself at the feet of the brethren, received
their prayer <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>) and went to his cell. Then he
began to do his hard works so that all the brethren and the prior of the
monastery were ashamed by the ardour of his labour. ---- Now we shall return to
her father Zeno and her mother.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As usually they rose and went to the castle. The old men came and opened the
doors; then they entered. Now she would run to meet her mother and her father
joyfully and to salute them. When they entered they perceived the disorder and
traces of her, but they heard no sound. They called for the governess, who began
to tremble, so that she could not answer them. When they reached the room, where
their daughter used to sleep, <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A> they
found that she had laid off her silk garments and the golden girdle which was
round her waist and her shoes and that she had departed barefoot. Then the king
said: &quot;Tell me, woman, and be not afraid, whether thou knowest where she
hath gone to&quot;. She swore to them: &quot;I know not where she hath gone to,
nor at which time she hath departed. But three days before she gave me a golden
dinar and said to me: &quot;I beg thee to buy for me a monk's habit&quot;. Then
I went and bought what she wished&quot;. Then they understood that she had gone
to the desert. The king beat his breast and threw the crown from his head and
began to recite about what had befallen him regarding his daughter:</p>
<p>&quot;O star, that sparkled upon me, and now hath set and become obscure,</p>
<p>O moon, that shone upon me, and now is eclipsed and become dark&quot;. And he
said: &quot;Thou, Lord, who makest the rivers flow and hast created the
creatures in the deepest depth, that they praise Thy holy name; Thou hast
created the trees and hast adorned them by beautiful fruit, that they give
praises to thy great name&quot;. With the axes of his sighs he demolished
mountains and with the soap of his tears he washed his garments, saying:</p>
<p>&quot;Thou, who gavest back Joseph to our father Jacob so that his sorrow and
his grief ceased, just so I expect from Thy generosity, that I may see her with
my eyes and augment praise and glory to Thy name&quot;. While he recited and
lamented and wept those who heard him trembled from awe before his words. And
the old men cried in the metre of Mar Jacob: <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> &quot;The righteous have bewailed their
  beloved with great sorrow,</p>
  <p>Because resurrection was hidden from them and not spoken out,</p>
  <p>Abraham bewailed Sara when he buried her</p>
  <p>And accompanied and interred her with great mourning before the eyes of
  many.</p>
  <p>Abraham was bewailed by his heir Isaac.</p>
  <p>And when Isaac died he was bewailed by Jacob.</p>
  <p>Joseph and his brethren mourned seventy days and bewailed the old Jacob
  when he had died <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>)&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>) threw the crown from his head; her
mother p. laid aside the royal robe and put on a coat of hair and put off her
veil and began to lament and to utter bitter words, till the hard stones would
weep with her. She said: &quot;Had I wings like the dove and strength like the
eagle, I should fly round the blood of my heart and make cease this heavy sorrow
and grief. I must lament with the lamenting dove and cry with the nightingale
when she crieth in the trees. So I lament and cry over ----the blood of my heart
which hath ruined my strength and vigour and hath gone. She said in the metre of
Mar Ephrem:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> This is the gate full of mercy,</p>
  <p>In it is mercy.</p>
  <p>Enter, o sinner, and beg mercy</p>
  <p>From thy Lord who is full of mercy <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weep, ye daughters of Eve, with me over a ewe which had one lamb and the wolf
came and fetched it, and now how can the ewe be consoled? And over a <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>
dove which had one cub and the hawk fetched it, and now whereby can the dove be
consoled? And over a vineyard which had one bunch and the sparrows came and
picked it away and now whereby can the vineyard be consoled? O wine in a glass,
O rose of the gardens which hath withered now. O myrtle, whose odours I used to
smell when the zephyr blew, which would heal my sickness&quot;.</p>
<p>Her mother and her father remained for three days weeping and lamenting. And
after three days they opened the treasuries and gave gold to the slaves of the
court and said to them: &quot;Go and search in all monasteries and dwellings of
hermits; perhaps you will find the light of my eye and the blood of my
heart&quot;. He took with him his bodyguard and marched towards the desert till
he reached the monastery where his daughter was serving her Lord. The monks
feared from awe before the king and flew into the desert. When the king...<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>)
they asked him saying:</p>
<p>&quot;What is thy wish, happy king&quot;? He beat his breast and lamented and
wept, saying: &quot;My child Hilaria, the fruit of prayer, hath flown from
between my hands and, we know not what hath passed her, we hope that your
holiness will, stand praying and beseeching God; perhaps He will accept your
prayer and as He hath done the first time, when He gave me her, He will give her
back to us this time by your prayers&quot;. They rang the</p>
<p>wooden gong and three hundred monks assembled. They stood praying and the
chosen [maid], John the eunuch, amongst them. They began to beseech and to pray,
that <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A> Christ might reveal to them
what had passed her; but she beseeched Christ to conceal it and her prayer was
accepted and got the upperhand over the three hundred so that she was not found
out. Then the prior of the monastery came and began to console the king saying:
&quot;Faithful and happy king (may God prolong thy life and forgive thy sins) be
not grieved nor ....<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>) over the brilliant gem
which shineth before its Creator. Compare thyself with our father Abraham, how
he let down the knife on the neck of Isaac to slay him. Compare thyself, O king
(who may be rendered happy by his Lord) with Jephtah who sacrificed his daughter
and shed her blood from love for his Lord. Compare thyself, O king (may his Lord
render him happy) with the blessed Lady Shamuni, the martyr, how she sacrificed
her seven sons to God with joy and gladness. So thou wilt be consoled by Christ
and He will comfort thy heart by His grace. Perhaps He will grant thee another
child&quot;.</p>
<p>The king and queen were consoled by the speech of the venerable Father and
their sorrow ceased. They returned to their home being bewildered. After a short
time God granted them a girl; they rejoiced over her greatly. She was brought up
in the way of princely children, in the best manner, till she had finished five
years of her life. Then Satan began to throw her down and to torment her
vehemently. The queen said to the king: &quot;My husband, we cannot but send her
to the monastery of Abu Macarius, perhaps Christ will heal her by their
prayers&quot;. The king said: &quot;Thy advice is accepted&quot;. At once he
ordered the most splendid votive <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>
presents to be brought and summoned ten old men, whom he commanded to accompany
His daughter to the monastery and to stay with her three days. If she was healed
then, they should take her back; but if not, they should leave her behind in the
monastery till she would have been healed. They answered: &quot;We shall obey
thy command&quot;. They took the girl and accompanied her to the monastery, told
the monks her history, and made themselves worthy of the confidence the king had
put in them. They remained three days with them and, the girl being not healed,
they left her behind in the monastery and returned to the king. When it was
evening the prior of the monastery and the monks deliberated: &quot;To whom
shall we entrust this girl?&quot; They unanimously chose John the eunuch,
because he was a eunuch and more abundant in performing offices and ascetic
works than any of them. Then they called him and trusted to him the girl his
sister, the daughter of his mother and his father. He accepted her with joy and
great gladness and took her hand and they went to his cell. When they had
entered the cell the chosen [maid] rose, set her sister at her side, and began
to shed tears and to sigh and to beat her pure breast and to cover the ground
with her face, before Christ.</p>
<p>After three prostrations Satan left the girl, shrieking and flying, like a
slave, more black than soot. She went up to her sister, made the sign of the
cross upon her and embraced her. She praised the Lord and thanked Him, accepting
the signs of His grace, for this gift and the healing which had taken place at
her hands.</p>
<p>Then she began to speak with her sister in rest and tranquillity, saying:
&quot;What is the name of the king thy <A NAME="p77"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|77</SPAN></A>
father and of thy mother?&quot; She answered: &quot;The name of my mother is
Shams al-Munir and the name of my father is king Zeno&quot;. She said: &quot;May
Christ inspire them with righteousness, prolong their kingdom and give them
victory over their enemies&quot;. She answered: &quot;Amen. It may be according
to thy word and by thy prayer&quot;.</p>
<p>When she had given this sweet answer, Hilaria perceived that she was
completely healed from her sickness. Then she asked, saying: &quot;Hast thou
brethren or sisters?&quot; She answered: &quot;No, Father, I have no brother nor
sister. But sometimes my mother sighed and shed tears. When I asked: &quot;Why
weepest thou, mother?&quot;, she said: &quot;I had a daughter, named Hilaria;
she left her castle in the dead of night and we have heard nothing of her&quot;.
While she told this, the holy maid shed tears; she said: &quot;May the Lord help
her and console her sorrow and....&quot;<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>). She
answered: &quot;Amen. May it be by thy prayer, our Father. May thy word be
accepted&quot;. Then Hilaria began to teach her reading and knowledge and
demeanour and agreeable speech and dignity. And by the prayer of the holy maid,
her mind was opened and she began to read and to interpret like one of the old
and learned men. After two months the men came to fetch her. They brought
presents and all sorts of good things. They asked after the girl and it was told
them that she was healed. When she was brought into their presence and they had
saluted her, she gave the best answer and began to ask about her parents in most
beautiful words. Then they praised God and thanked [Him for] His bounty and
kissed the feet of the prior <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A> of the
monastery and of those who were present with him. They stayed with them three
days, till they had overcome the fatigue of the journey, then they took the girl
and returned to their abode and castle. When she met her mother and father, they
were struck by her good colour and beauty. She began to tell them about the
inhabitants of the monastery. Her father said to her: &quot;My beloved, who was
the man that healed thee, who was so benevolent towards thee? [Tell us], then we
shall honour him. Who hath wrought this benefaction? We shall honour him and
reward him twofold for what he hath done for thee&quot;. She answered: &quot;My
father, when the slaves had left me and were gone, the wooden gong was rung and
the monks assembled and deliberated together: &quot;With whom shall we leave
this girl?&quot; They said unanimously: &quot;With the chosen John, the
eunuch&quot;. Then the prior of the monastery called him and said: &quot;Draw
near, my child. Accept the word of thy brethren and take the daughter of the
faithful king, and beseech Christ thy prayer, that she may be healed and your
fame exalted and confidence in Him and in the faithful be augmented by your
holiness&quot;. Then he wept and prostrated himself on the ground, saying:
&quot;Who am I amongst your holy persons? For I am a sinful slave, lower than
all the brethren, O Father&quot;. The prior of the monastery sobbed and wept and
considered his demeanour and modesty. He laid the exalted cross on his head and
said: &quot;Contradict not the opinion of the brethren about thyself, O saint of
the Lord&quot;. Then he drew near and kissed the feet of the prior of the
monastery and of the old men, obeyed, and took my hand with love and great joy.
I went with him to his cell. <A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A> When he
had entered his cell, he turned towards the East <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>)
and began to pray.</p>
<p>He beat his breast and shed tears till they trickled on the ground like rain,
and covered the ground with his face, so that I trembled from awe before him.
When he had prostrated himself one time and two times and three full times, and
laid the cross on my head ---- lo, there departed from me a slave black as soot.
He cried to him and scolded him. Then he left the cell and flew. At the same
moment I felt that I was healed and that my soul had become quiet. Then he
stroked my head with his blessed hand and began to converse with me in quietness
and tranquillity. When he spoke with me, I smelled from his mouth an odour like
perfume, which refreshed me. Then he began to ask about my father and my mother,
saying: &quot;Hast thou brethren or sisters&quot;? And he asked about all my
kindred. The more I spoke to him, the more he wept, so that I wondered for which
cause those tears trickled and streamed down constantly, not to speak of
fasting, prayer, and long vigils. When he desired to sleep he lent against the
wall and slumbered somewhat. Then he began with passion and great strength his
prostrations and humiliations. When he had finished his prayer he taught me
reading and the principles of good demeanour and knowledge. He held me in great
honour. And when thou sent after me, my father, it was not a light matter for me
to let him alone. May the Lord show us mercy by his prayer, constantly.
Amen&quot;.</p>
<p>King Zeno wondered at what he heard about this <A NAME="p80"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|80</SPAN></A>
saint and he began to think where this eunuch might come from and which king he
possibly could have served and what his origin might be. His thoughts tortured
him vehemently. Then he called the old men which had brought back the girl, and
said to them: &quot;Go and return to the monastery a second time and take with
you food and drink and presents as is becoming to the sacred monastery. And
greet the prior of the monastery and tell him to send me ten old men of the
monks, amongst them John the eunuch. This is absolutely necessary&quot;. Then
the slaves of the king rose and loaded up all sorts of things becoming to the
monastery and the monks. They departed confiding in God, like all faithful
persons. When they had reached the monastery they told the prior of the
monastery what the king had said to them. The prior answered: &quot;The order of
the faithful king (may God prolong his happiness and confirm his dynasty) be
carried out&quot;. The wooden gong was rung and all the monks assembled and
received the blessing from one another like the angels <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>).
They stood during the ministration of the exalted sacrifice, the hope of the
living and the dead. The prior of the monastery selected nine old men, called
John and said to him: &quot;Rise,&quot; confiding in Christ (honour and praise
to Him who hath given this gift to thy holiness), O glory of our religion and
crown of our heads, joy of our hearts; rise and go to the king and be ever more
loyal to him&quot;. They received the blessing of one another and went on their
way. On the whole way they recited psalms and songs of praise without break, so
that the bodyguard of <A NAME="p81"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|81</SPAN></A> the king
trembled from awe before them. When they entered the town the king heard of
their arrival. The people went to meet them with signs of honour and great
esteem; and the faithful, men and women, would take dust from under their feet
and give it their children to drink. And the blessing [of God] took abode in
that town by their prayers and blessings.</p>
<p>The king summoned his confidant and said to him: &quot;Take these old men and
let them take rest, heat water and wash their feet. Spread the best cloth under
them and pour the water of their feet into the storehouses that people may
receive a blessing by the blessings of their prayers; and bring food as much as
thou canst.&quot; He answered: &quot;According to thy good pleasure, O king of
the time.&quot; The king laid hold on John and went with him to the royal
appartment. When he drew near to the girl she uttered a cry and came towards
him, kissed his feet and prostrated herself on the ground and covered his feet
with her face. Then the Fruit of Prayer cried, in the metre of Mar Jacob: (<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
&quot;Peace, peace unto you, who are far and near, sayeth the Lord, who hath
spread peace among mortals. The cross hath shown the love of the Father towards
the whole world. The Lord hath revealed Himself and the world hath perceived how
He loveth it&quot; <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>). She blessed her mother and
raised her head from the ground. Grace came down upon that place where she had
taken abode. ---- When they had taken rest, the king opened the conversation and
said: &quot;Our Father, heavenly blessing hath come down upon us by the coming
of thy highness and thou hast shown <A NAME="p82"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|82</SPAN></A>
us the utmost bounty and favour by the healing of our daughter. I beseech thy
holiness to tell me from where thou art and what thy extraction is, and who was
the king whom thou hast served and who hath freed thee, and how thou earnest to
the monastery, how thou wast liberated from [the service of] the kings, so that
they let thee go to this holy monastery.&quot; After every answer the king asked
a new question. Then she perceived the thoughts of her father, that he was weary
on account of herself. Obedient as she was, she understood that the word of a
king is not to be withstood. She said: &quot;Happy king, if thou desirest that I
speak to thy majesty about myself, give an order to these servants [to depart]
and let nobody stay except thyself and my mother the queen and the beautiful
girl.&quot; He ordered those who were present to depart. They saluted the king,
took Hilaria's blessing and went away. Then she conjured her father, saying:
&quot;Swear by the right hand [of God] and by the voice that cried over the
Jordan when our Lord was baptized; swear to me by the whole congregation <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>),
and&quot; by the blood and the water which flowed from His side and saved our
father Adam and his posterity; and swear to me by His mighty resurrection and
His ascension unto heaven, that thou wilt not press me nor divulge my secret;
then I will reveal my history to thee&quot;. He trembled from awe before the
oaths with which she had conjured him. Then he swore to her all the oaths which
she had conjured him by. Then she took the cape from her head and raised the
cloth from her eyes. She recited, saying in the metre of Mar <A NAME="p83"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|83</SPAN></A>
Ephrem: (<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> &quot;You are my father and my mother
and I am your daughter Hilaria. Let us cry and say to the Lord, the Highest:
Halleluja&quot;. The king and Shamsha Munira listened to Hilaria. They were
confused and trembled and they fainted, being as dead <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>).
You are my father and my mother and I am your daughter Hilaria&quot;. They
trembled and fainted and were confused and (<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>fell down <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>) on the ground from the
vehemence of what had befallen them, they lay down and were as dead. ----When
she saw what had befallen her mother and her father, she wept and said: &quot;O
Lord, let them constantly be confident in Thee&quot;. Then she took water,
blessed it, and sprinkled it on them so that they awoke and praised the
bounteous Lord and they were no longer sorry but constantly glad; they cried
together, in the metre of Mar Ephrem: (<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> &quot;A
thousand times a thousand and ten thousand times ten thousand be the praise of
Thee, who acceptest the praise of the praisers who praise Thee. The whole
creation is obliged to praise Thee. The high and the low places sing Thy praise.
Praise to Thee&quot; <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>). Then they bowed their
heads till they ceased weeping. Then they began conversation with their daughter
gladly and joyfully and quietly, as she requested them. Her father said:
&quot;My daughter, light of my eyes, which hath been augmented to day so that it
shineth by thy light; my daughter, my heart's blood, I shall not break towards
thee the oath which I have sworn; but how can I dispense with thy holiness? What
is the best way of acting, my daughter? Build for thee and for <A NAME="p84"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|84</SPAN></A>
these holy men, thy brethren, a monastery outside this city, that I and thy
mother and sister may be with thee morning and evening&quot;. She answered:
&quot;No, my father; do not annul the institutions of the Ancients, who have
laid the foundations of the monasteries in the desert. Know, my father, that the
farther the monasteries are from the world the better it is. And regarding me,
Christ will give thee patience and inward joy and thy soul will rejoice in the
grace of thy Lord.&quot; He answered and said: &quot;Amen, may thy word be
accepted.&quot;</p>
<p>They stayed three days till the fatigue of the journey had disappeared. Then
the saints begged him permission to depart. He said: &quot;Your order will be
done&quot;. He ordered to be brought before his daughter clothes and utensils,
gold and silver, tapers and perfume, oil and food, in unnumbered masses. She
said: &quot;My father, may thy votive presents be accepted, and the Lord forgive
thy sins and trespasses. As to gold and silver, we have no prescript to take it.
But I will give thee and thy servants a counsel.&quot; He said: &quot;Give
order, O blood of the heart of thy mother and father.&quot; She said to him:
&quot;My father, seven days after our depart thou shalt send masters and workmen
in great number in order to make in the monastery deep pits, that all people may
drink from their water and thy wages be constant till the end.&quot; He said:
&quot;Thy will be done, O crown of our heads.&quot; Then she took all that could
be profitable to the holy monastery; and the rest she told her father to divide
among the poor. Then they took leave from her and asked her blessing. And she
also prostrated herself before her parents.</p>
<p>Then they went on their way. People perceived them and went to meet them. And
they tore pieces from their <A NAME="p85"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|85</SPAN></A> habits
and took the dust from under their feet and the Lord gave them according to
their fidelity. With trouble and accompanied by a crowd they departed from the
town. They marched singing and sanctifying and. praising God, under the royal
safeguard. And the secret remained kept. When they came near the monastery, the
prior and all the brethren went to meet them. They made obeisances before one
another and praised the Lord and thanked for the signs of His grace. Then
everyone took the place becoming to him. After the seven days the king sent his
slaves and workmen with them to the monastery. They saluted the prior of the
monastery and told him the command of the king: &quot;We have to do what John
shall order us&quot;. Then John was called. He left his cell, reciting the
praise of the Lord and his lips ceased not sanctifying the Lord. They went to
meet him and asked his blessing. He asked after the king and the queen and the
state of mind of the girl. They answered: &quot;They wish thee much peace. The
girl is well&quot;. Then they praised God and thanked Him and said to John:
&quot;See, where thou wilt have us work&quot;. He said to them: &quot;From here
till there. Work so and so and it will be completed by the power of the Lord and
His good pleasure&quot;. They began to dig and built and completed by the power
of Him who worketh all completion; to Him be praise and honour eternally. Amen.
When the workmen had finished and terminated their work they received the
prayers and the blessings of the brethren and returned to the king and
congratulated him on the completion of the work. He praised God and thanked Him,
and asked after John. They said: &quot;What shall we tell thee about his
holiness, standing among us and laying <A NAME="p86"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|86</SPAN></A>
hand on the work like us, while his lips ceased not praising and sanctifying
God? Blessed are the father and the mother who begat him.&quot; When this word
reached his ear his heart trembled <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>) and
rejoiced, he gave them their wages and presents very graciously and began to
send every two months presents in honour of the (<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
secret of his heart <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>) so that all the monasteries
and everyone who heard it, wondered and they began to speak with one another,
saying: &quot;If he belonge.d not to his kindred, he would not show him this
honour and submissiveness&quot;. And she used to take all the presents which her
father sent and send them to the monasteries in the neigbourhood. But when she
heard that the monks spoke amongst each other in that way, she feared that her
history might be revealed and her work become fruitless. Then she went away
stealthily and travelled in the desert in heat and thurst, barefoot on thistles
and pebbles and thorns, one, two, three days, till she reached the border part
of the desert. There she found a garganas-tree and near it a waterpool; at the
water grew desert herbs. Near the tree was a hole which could hold one man. She
praised God and thanked Him for the signs of His grace and said: &quot;This
garganas-tree is winter food, and the herbs are summer food. Then she entered
the hole and dwelt in it for ten years, nobody knowing about her except Christ
who had created and sent her.&quot;</p>
<p>Now there were venerable old men among the priors of the monasteries who used
every year to take with them a beast of burden and to load on it food and <A NAME="p87"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|87</SPAN></A>
drink and clothes and shrouds, and to go round the whole desert. And every one
whom they saw in need of food, they would feed; and whom they saw bare, they
would clothe; and whom they found sick or distressed they would cure, and whom
they found dead they would bury according to God's order.</p>
<p>During ten years the existence of this saint remained concealed, till the day
of her transition to blessed Paradise came. Then they came up to the entrance of
the hole; at once they heard the sound of sighing from the depth of the earth.
They thought it to be an animal growling against them. But as soon as they
inspected the place they found there the traces of human footsteps. They said to
one another: &quot;There is a saint in this hole. Possibly he is ill, let us go
in and look.&quot; They made the sign of the cross on their face, began to
recite and entered up to the border of the hole; at once they saw the hair of
the innocent one shining like a polished sword in the sunshine. When she heard
their reciting she rose and made an obeisance before them. Then she went back,
sat down leaning on her side and trusted her pure spirit to her Lord. At her
death her pure odour spread till the desert was filled with her perfume. Then
the saints began to praise and to sanctify the Lord Jesus Christ, who loveth the
children of man and giveth them such beautiful gifts. They bore her out of the
hole and began to put off her worn out clothes and shroud her honourably in new
shrouds, as was becoming. But while they were stripping off her clothes they
found her breasts withered on her pure bosom like leaves wither beneath the
trees; then one of them knocked his head and cried to his companions: <A NAME="p88"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|88</SPAN></A>
&quot;Look here, my brethren, and gaze at this wonder; she is a virgin and not a
man.&quot; When they saw the wonder they praised God who had helped her and led
her to perfection. They dug a grave and buried her and the angels descended to
honour her.</p>
<p>When they had buried her, they went to the water-pool to drink. But they
found the water dried up and the herbs withered and likewise the tree. Then they
praised the great Lord and stayed wondering over this fact. Then each of them
laid his head on a stone and lay down to sleep. They beseeched God to make known
to them her whole history, and her coming to that place. They laid down their
heads and slept. Then the angel descended and made known to them her whole
history from the beginning of her beautiful demeanour up to the day of her
departure as they had witnessed it. When they awoke and discussed their dream
among themselves it appeared to be one and the same. Then they wrote down the
history of the chosen virgin and sent it to the parts of the whole world that it
might be profitable for the faithful by her prayers.</p>
<p>And we, the sinners, will beseech our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to give
you security in your dwelling places and_to protect your wives and to support
your old men, to give health to your youths and to bring up your children, to
give abundant blessing on the work of your hands, by the prayer of the dome of.
light, the mother of all creatures, the mother of Salvation, the mistress of
women and men, the hope of the dead and the living, our Lady Mariam, the mother
of God, the Virgin, and of Mar Petrus the Apostle, and by the prayers of the
pure Prophets and Disciples and the rest of the Martyrs <A NAME="p89"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|89</SPAN></A>
and the Saints and by the prayer of this excellent saint Hilaria, the daughter
of the faithful king Zeno. Their prayers and the prayers of all who have the
same rank may protect all the faithful and the poor scribe and the reader and
the hearers. The mercy of the Lord be upon every one who sayeth Amen, O Lord of
the worlds, Amen, (<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> our Father in heaven <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>).</p>
<p>Here endeth the story of the holy Hilaria, the daughter of king Zeno. May the
Lord protect us by her prayers. Amen.</p>
