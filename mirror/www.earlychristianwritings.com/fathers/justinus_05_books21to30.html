  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b> WHEN Dionysius the tyrant was cut off in Sicily, the army elected in his
room Dionysius the eldest of his sons, both in accordance with the law of
nature, and because they thought the power would be more secure, if it continued
in the hands of one son, than if it were divided among several. <A NAME="p172"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|172</SPAN></A>
Dionysius, at the commencement of his reign, was eager to remove the uncles
of his brothers,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> as being his rivals in the government, and as having
encouraged the young men to ask for a division of power. But concealing his
inclinations for a while, he applied himself first to gain the favour of his
subjects, as being likely to cause the atrocity, which he had resolved on
committing, to be regarded with more indulgence, if he previously made himself
popular. He therefore released three thousand prisoners from the gaols, remitted
the people the taxes for three years, and sought the affection of all by
whatever blandishments he could use. Then, proceeding to execute his
determination, he put to death, not only the relatives of his brothers, but his
brothers themselves; so that he left to those, to whom he owed a share of power,
not even a share of life, and commenced cruelty upon his kindred before he
exercised it upon strangers.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> When his rivals were removed, he fell into indolence, and contracted,
from excessive indulgence at table, great corpulence of body, and a disease in
his eyes, so that he could not bear the sunshine, or dust, or even the
brightness of ordinary daylight. Suspecting that, for these weaknesses, he was
despised by his subjects, he proceeded to inflict cruelties upon them; not
filling the gaols, like his father, with prisoners, but the whole city with dead
bodies. Hence he became not more, contemptible than hateful to every one. The
Syracusans, in consequence, resolving to rebel against him, he long hesitated
whether he should lay down the government or oppose them in arms; but he was
compelled by the soldiery, who hoped for plunder from sacking the city, to march
into the field. Being defeated, and trying his fortune again with no better
success, he sent deputies to the people of Syracuse, with promises that &quot;he
would resign the government, if they would send persons to him with whom he
might settle terms of peace.&quot; Some of the principal citizens being <A NAME="p173"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|173</SPAN></A>
accordingly sent for that purpose, he put them in close confinement, and
then, when all were off their guard, having no fear of hostilities, he
despatched his army to devastate the city. A contest, in consequence, which was
long doubtful, took place in the town itself, but the townsmen overpowering the
soldiery by their numbers, Dionysius was obliged to retire, and fearing that he
should be besieged in the citadel, fled away secretly, with all his king-like
paraphernalia, to Italy. Being received, in his exile, by his allies the
Locrians, he took possession of the citadel as if he were their rightful
sovereign, and exercised his usual outrages upon them. He ordered the wives of
the principal men to be seized and violated; he took away maidens on the point
of marriage, polluted them, and then restored them to their betrothed husbands;
and as for the wealthiest men, he either banished them or put them to death, and
confiscated their property.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> In process of time, when a pretext for plunder was wanting, he
over-reached the whole city by an artful stratagem. The Locrians, being harassed
in war by Leophron the tyrant of Rhegium, had vowed, if they were victorious, to
prostitute their maidens on the festal day of Venus; and as, on neglecting to
perform the vow, they were unsuccessful in another war with the Lucanians,
Dionysius called them to an assembly, and advised them &quot;to send their wives
and daughters, as richly dressed as possible, to the temple of Venus; out of
whom a hundred, chosen by lot, should fulfil the public vow, and, for religion's
sake, offer themselves for prostitution during the space of a month, the men
previously taking an oath not to touch any one of them; and, in order that this
should be no detriment to the women who released the state from its vow, they
should make a decree, <i>that no other maiden should be married till these were
provided with husbands.&quot; </i>This proposal, by which regard was shown both
to their superstitious observances and to the honour of their virgins, being
received with approbation, the whole of the women, in most expensive dresses,
assembled in the temple of Venus, when Dionysius, sending in his soldiers, took
off their finery, and made the ornaments of the matrons a spoil for himself. The
husbands of some of them too, who were of the richer class, he put to death;
others he tortured to make them discover their husbands' wealth. After reigning
in this manner for six years, <A NAME="p174"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|174</SPAN></A> he was driven from Locri by a conspiracy of the people, and returned to
Sicily; where, while all, after so long an interval of peace, were free from
apprehension, he possessed himself of Syracuse by surprise.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> While this affair occurred in Sicily, Hanno, a leading man among the
Carthaginians, in Africa, employed his power, which surpassed that of the
government, to secure the sovereignty for himself, and endeavoured to establish
himself as king by killing the senate. For the execution of this atrocity he
fixed on the day of his daughter's marriage, in order that his nefarious plot
might be the better concealed in the pomp of religious ceremonies. He
accordingly prepared a banquet-for the common people in the public porticoes,
and another for the senate in his own house, so that, by poisoning the cups, he
might take off the senate privately and without witnesses, and then more easily
seize the government, when none were left to prevent him.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> The plot being
disclosed to the magistrates by his agents, his destructive intentions were
frustrated, but not punished, lest the matter, if publicly known, should
occasion more trouble, in the case of so powerful a man, than the mere design of
it had caused. Satisfied, therefore, with putting a stop to it, they merely set
bounds by a decree to the expenses of marriage entertainments, and ordered the
decree to be obeyed, not by him alone, but universally, that nothing personal to
him, but the general correction of an abuse, might seem to be intended.
Prevented by this measure, he, for a second attempt, raised the slaves, and
appointing another day for the massacre of the senate, but finding himself again
betrayed, he threw himself, for fear of being brought to trial, into a strong
fortress with a body of twenty thousand armed slaves. Here, while he was
soliciting the Africans, and the king of the Moors, to join him, he was
captured, and after being scourged, having his eyes put out, and his arms and
legs broken, as if atonement was to be exacted from every limb, he was put to
death in the sight of the people, and his body, mangled with stripes, was nailed
to a cross. All his children and relations, too, though guiltless, were
delivered to the executioner, that no member of so nefarious a family might
survive either to imitate his villainy, or to revenge his death. <A NAME="p175"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|175</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>V. </b> Dionysius, in the meantime, being re-established in Syracuse, and becoming
every day more oppressive and cruel to the people, was assailed by a new band of
conspirators Laying down the government, therefore, he delivered up the city and
army to the Syracusans, and, being allowed to take his private property with
him, went to live in exile at Corinth; where, looking on the lowest station as
the safest, he humbled himself to the very meanest condition of life. He was not
content with strolling about the streets, but would even stand drinking in them;
he was not satisfied with being seen in taverns and impure houses, but would sit
in them for whole days. He would dispute with the most abandoned fellows about
the merest trifles, walk about in rags and dirt, and afford laughter to others
more readily than he would laugh at them. He would stand in the shambles,
devouring with his eyes what he was not able to purchase; he would wrangle with
the dealers before the aediles, and do everything in such a manner <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
as to appear
an object of contempt rather than of fear. At last he assumed the profession of
a schoolmaster, and taught children in the open streets, either that he might
continually be seen in public <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> by those who feared him, or might be more
readily despised by those who did not fear him; for though he had still plenty
of the vices peculiar to tyrants, yet his present conduct was an affectation of
vices, <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> and not the effect of nature, and he adopted it rather from cunning
than from having lost the self-respect becoming a sovereign, having experienced
how odious the names of tyrants are, even when they are deprived of power. He
strove, therefore, to diminish the odium incurred from his past by the
contemptibleness of his present life, not looking to honourable but to safe
practices. Yet amidst all these arts of dissimulation, he was accused of
aspiring to the sovereignty, and was left at liberty only because he was
despised.
</p>
<p><b>VI. </b> During these proceedings, the Carthaginians, alarmed at the rapid
successes of Alexander the Great, and fearing that he might resolve to annex
Africa to his Persian empire, <A NAME="p176"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|176</SPAN></A> sent Hamilcar, surnamed Rhodanus, a man remarkable for wit and eloquence
beyond others, to sound his intentions; for, indeed, the capture of Tyre, their
own parent city, and the founding of Alexandria, as a rival to Carthage, on the
confines of Africa and Egypt, as well as the good fortune of the king, whose
ambition and success seemed to know no limit, raised their apprehensions to an
extreme height. Hamilcar, obtaining access to the king through the favour of
Parmenio, represented himself to Alexander as having been banished from his
country, and as having fled to him for refuge, offering, at the same time, to
serve as a soldier in the expedition against Carthage. Having thus ascertained
his views, he sent a full account of them to his countrymen, inscribed on wooden
tablets, with blank wax spread over the writing. The Carthaginians, however,
when he returned home after the death of Alexander, put him to death, not only
ungratefully but cruelly, on pretence that he had offered to sell their city to
the king.

</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b>AGATHOCLES,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> tyrant of Sicily, who attained greatness equal to that of the
elder Dionysius, rose to royal dignity from the lowest and meanest origin. He
was born in Sicily, his father being a potter, and spent a youth not more
honourable than his birth; for, being remarkable for beauty and gracefulness of
person, he supported himself a considerable time by submitting to the infamous
lust of others. When he had <A NAME="p177"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|177</SPAN></A> passed the years of puberty, ho transferred his services from men to women.
Having thus become infamous with both sexes, he next changed his way of life for
that of a robber. Some time after, having gone to Syracuse and been received as
a citizen among the other inhabitants, he was long without credit, appearing to
have as little of property to lose as he had of character to blacken. At last,
enlisting in the army as a common soldier, he showed himself ready for every
kind of audacity, his life being then not less distinguished by restlessness
than it had previously been by infamy. He was noted for activity in the field,
and for eloquence in making harangues. In a short time, accordingly, he became a
centurion, and soon after a tribune. In his first campaign against the people of
Aetna,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> he gave the Syracusans great proofs of what he could do; in the next,
against the Campanians, he excited such hopes of himself throughout the army,
that he was chosen to fill the place of the deceased general, Damascon, whose
wife, after the death of her husband, he married, having previously had a
criminal connection with her. And, not content that from being poor he was
suddenly made rich, he engaged in piracy against his own country. He was saved
from death by his companions, who, when apprehended and put to the torture,
denied his guilt. Twice he attempted to make himself sovereign of Syracuse, and
twice he was driven into exile.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> By the Murgantines, with whom he took refuge in his banishment, he was
first, from hatred to the Syracusans, made praetor, and afterwards
general-in-chief. In the war which he conducted for them, he both took the city
of the Leontines, and proceeded to besiege his native city, Syracuse; when
Hamilcar, general of the Carthaginians, being entreated to aid it, laid aside
his hatred as an enemy, and sent a body of troops thither. Thus, at one and the
same time, Syracuse was both defended by an enemy with the love of a citizen,
and attacked by a citizen with the hatred of an enemy. But Agathocles, seeing
that the city was defended with more vigour than it was assailed, entreated
Hamilcar, through his deputies, to undertake the settlement of a peace between
him and the Syracusans, promising him particular services in return for the
favour. Hamilcar, induced by such hopes, and by dread of <A NAME="p178"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|178</SPAN></A>
his power, made an alliance with him, on condition that whatever assistance
he furnished Agathocles against the Syracusans, he himself should receive as
much for the augmentation of his power at home. Not only peace, in consequence,
was procured for Agathocles, but he was also appointed praetor at Syracuse; and
he then swore to Hamilcar that he would be faithful to the Carthaginians, the
[sacred] fires, at the same time, being set forth, and touched by him.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Some
time after, having received from Hamilcar five thousand African troops, he put
to death the most powerful of the leading citizens; and then, as if intending to
re-model the constitution, he ordered the people to be summoned to an assembly
in the theatre, convoking the senate, in the meantime, in the Gymnasium, as
though he designed to make some previous arrangements with them. His measures
being thus taken, he sent his troops to surround the people, and caused the
senate to be massacred, and, when he had finished the slaughter of them, cut off
the richest and boldest of the commoners.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> These things being done, he made choice of troops, and embodied a
regular army; with which he suddenly attacked several of the neighbouring cities
when they were under no apprehension of hostilities. He also disgracefully
harassed, with the connivance of Hamilcar, certain allies of the Carthaginians,
who, in consequence, sent complaints to Carthage, not so much against Agathocles
as against Hamilcar, accusing &quot;the former, indeed, as an oppressor and
tyrant, but the latter as a traitor, by whom the possessions of their allies,
under a settled compact, were betrayed to the bitterest of enemies; for as, at
first, Syracuse (a city always hostile to the Carthaginians, and a competitor
with Carthage for the <A NAME="p179"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|179</SPAN></A> dominion of Sicily) was delivered to Agathocles as a bond of union with
Hamilcar, so, at the present time, the cities of the allies of Carthage were
given up to the same tyrant under pretence of making peace. They warned them,
therefore, that these proceedings would shortly come home to themselves, and
that they would feel what mischief they had brought,<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> not more upon Sicily than
upon Africa itself.&quot; At these complaints the senate was incensed against
Hamilcar, but as he was in command of the army, they gave their votes concerning
him secretly, and caused their several opinions, before they were openly read,
to be put in an urn, and sealed up, until the other Hamilcar, the son of Gisco,
should return from Sicily. But the death of Hamilcar prevented all effects from
these subtle contrivances and suppressed judgments,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> and he, whom his fellow
citizens had unjustly condemned unheard, was freed from danger of punishment by
the kindness of destiny. The proceeding furnished Agathocles with a pretext for
making war on the Carthaginians. His first engagement was with Hamilcar, the son
of Gisco, by whom he was defeated, and retired to Syracuse to prepare himself
for war with fresh vigour. But the result of his second encounter was the same
as that of the first.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> The victorious Carthaginians, in consequence, having invested Syracuse
with a close siege, Agathocles, perceiving that he was neither a match for them
in the field, nor provided for enduring a blockade, and being deserted,
moreover, by his allies, who were disgusted at his cruelties, resolved to
transfer the war into Africa; a resolution formed with wonderful audacity, that
he should make war on the city of a people for whom he was not a match in his
own city; that he who could not defend his own country should invade that of
others; and that one who had been conquered should brave his conquerors. Nor was
the secrecy of his plan less striking than the contrivance of it. Stating merely
to the people, that &quot;he had found out a way to victory, and that they had
only to prepare their minds to endure a short siege, or that, if any of them
were dissatisfied with their present circumstances, he gave them full liberty to
depart,&quot; he proceeded, after one thousand <A NAME="p180"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|180</SPAN></A>
six hundred had left him, to furnish the rest with provisions and money for
the necessities of a blockade, taking away with him only fifty talents for
present use, and intending to get further supplies rather from his enemies than
his friends. He then obliged all the slaves that were of age for war, after
receiving their freedom, to take the military oath, and put them and the greater
part of the soldiers, on ship-board, supposing that, as the condition of both
was made equal, there would be a mutual emulation in bravery between them.
</p>
<p><b>V. </b> In the seventh year of his reign, therefore, accompanied by his two
grown-up sons, Archagathus and Heraclides, he directed his course towards
Africa, not one of his men knowing whither he was sailing; but while they all
supposed that they were going to Italy or Sardinia for plunder, he landed his
army on the coast of Africa, and then for the first time made known his
intentions to them all. He reminded them in what condition Syracuse was,
&quot;for which there was no other remedy but that they should inflict on the
enemy the distresses that they themselves were suffering. Wars,&quot; he said,
&quot;were conducted in one way at home and in another abroad; at home, a
people's only support was what the resources of their country supplied; but
abroad, the enemy might be beaten by their own strength, while their allies fell
off, and from hatred of their long tyranny, looked about for foreign aid. To
this was added, that the cities and fortresses of Africa were not secured with
walls, or situate on eminences, but lay in level plains without any
fortifications, and might all be induced, by the fear of destruction, to join in
the war against Carthage. A greater war, in consequence, would blaze forth
against the Carthaginians from Africa itself than from Sicily, as the forces of
the whole region would combine against a city greater in name than in power, and
he himself would thus gain from the country the strength which he had not
brought into it. Nor would victory be only in a small degree promoted by the
sudden terror of the Carthaginians, who, astonished at such daring on the part
of their enemies, would be in utter consternation. Besides, there would be the
burning of country houses, the plundering of fortresses and towns that offered
resistance, and siege laid to Carthage itself; from all which disasters they
would learn that wars were practicable not only for them against others, but for
<A NAME="p181"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|181</SPAN></A> others against them. By these means the Carthaginians might not only be
conquered, but Sicily might be delivered from them; for they would not continue
to besiege Syracuse, when they were suffering from a siege of their own city.
Nowhere else, therefore, could war be found more easy, or plunder more abundant,
for, if Carthage were taken, all Africa and Sicily would be the prize of the
victors. The glory, too, of so honourable an enterprise, would be so celebrated
through all ages, that it could never be buried in oblivion; for it would be
said that they were the only men in the world who had carried abroad against
their enemies a war which they could not withstand at home; who, when defeated,
had pursued their conquerors, and besieged the besiegers of their own city. They
ought all accordingly, to prosecute, with equal courage and cheerfulness, an
enterprise, than which none could offer them a more noble reward if they were
victorious, or greater honour to their memory if they were conquered.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>VI. </b> By these exhortations the courage of the soldiers was excited; but the
superstitious influence of an omen had spread some dismay among them; for the
sun had been eclipsed <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> during their voyage. But with regard to this phenomenon
Agathocles was at no less pains to satisfy them than he had been with regard to
the war; alleging that, &quot;if it had happened before they set out, he should
have thought it a portent unfavourable to their departure, but since it had
occurred after they had set sail, its signification was directed against those
to whom they were going. Besides,&quot; he said, &quot;the eclipses of the
heavenly bodies always presaged a change in the present state of things, and it
was therefore certain that an alteration was foretold in the flourishing
condition of the Carthaginians and in their own adverse circumstances.&quot;
Having thus pacified his soldiers, he ordered all the ships, with the consent of
the army, to be set on fire, in order that, the means of flight being taken
away, they might understand that they must either conquer or die.
</p>
<p>While they were devastating the country wherever they went, and laying
farm-houses and fortresses in ashes, Hanno advanced to meet them with thirty
thousand Carthaginians. <A NAME="p182"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|182</SPAN></A> When they came to a battle, two thousand of the Sicilians, and three thousand
of the Carthaginians, with their general himself, were left on the field. By
this victory the spirits of the Sicilians were elated, and those of the
Carthaginians depressed. Agathocles, taking advantage of his success, stormed
several towns and forts, took a vast quantity of plunder, and killed many
thousands of the enemy. He then pitched his camp at the distance of five miles
from Carthage, that they might view from the walls of the city the destruction
of their most valuable possessions, the devastation of their lands, and the
burning of their houses. At the same time a great rumour of the destruction of
the Carthaginian army, and of the capture of their cities, was spread through
all Africa, and astonishment fell upon every one, wondering how so sudden a war
could have surprised so great an empire, especially from an enemy already
conquered. This wonder was gradually changed into a contempt for the
Carthaginians; and not long after, not only the populace of Africa, but the most
eminent cities, out of fondness for change, revolted to Agathocles, and
furnished the victorious army with corn and money.
</p>
<p><b>VII. </b> To these disasters of the Carthaginians, and as if to crown their evil
fortune, was added the destruction of their army and its general in Sicily. For
after the departure of Agathocles from the island, the Carthaginians,
prosecuting the siege of Syracuse with less vigour, were reported to have been
utterly cut off by Antander, the brother of Agathocles. The fortune of the
Carthaginians, therefore, being similar at home and abroad, not only their
tributary towns, but even princes that were in alliance with them, began to fall
off, estimating the obligations of confederacy not by the standard of honour but
by that of fortune. Among these was Opheltas, king of Cyrene, who, grasping,
with extravagant hopes, at the dominion of all Africa, made an alliance with
Agathocles through ambassadors, arranging that, when the Carthaginians were
subdued, the government of Sicily should fall to Agathocles, and that of Africa
to himself. But when he came, accordingly, with a numerous army, to take a share
in the war, Agathocles, after throwing him off his guard by the affability of
his address and the abjectness of his flattery, and after they had supped
together several times, and he had been adopted <A NAME="p183"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|183</SPAN></A>
by Opheltas as a son, put him to death, and taking the command of his forces,
defeated the Carthaginians, who were renewing the war with all their might, in a
second great battle, but with much loss to both armies. At this result of the
contest, such despair was felt by the Carthaginians, that, had not a mutiny
occurred among the troops of Agathocles, Bomilcar, the Carthaginian general,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
would have gone over to him with his army. For this treachery he was nailed to a
cross by the Carthaginians in the middle of the forum, that the place which had
formerly been the distinguished scene of his honours might also bear testimony
to his punishment. Bomilcar, however, bore the cruelty of his countrymen with
such fortitude, that from his cross, as if he had been on a judgment-seat, he
inveighed against the injustice of the Carthaginians, upbraiding them sometimes
with &quot;having cut off Hanno,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> on a false charge of aspiring to
sovereignty;&quot; sometimes with &quot;having banished the innocent
Gisco;&quot;<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> and. sometimes with &quot;having secretly condemned his uncle
Hamilcar,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> merely because he wished to make Agathocles their ally rather than
their enemy.&quot; After uttering these charges with a loud voice, in a numerous
assembly of the people, he expired.
</p>
<p><b>VIII. </b> Agathocles, meanwhile, having overcome all opposition in Africa, left
the command of his army to his son Archagathus, and went back to Sicily,
thinking that all he had done in Africa was as nothing, if Syracuse was still to
be besieged; for after the death of Hamilcar, the son of Gisco, a fresh army had
been sent thither by the Carthaginians. Immediately on his arrival, all the
cities of Sicily, having previously heard of his achievements in Africa,
unanimously submitted to him; and being thus enabled to drive the Carthaginians
from Sicily, he made himself master of the whole island. Returning afterwards to
Africa, he was received by his army in a state of mutiny; for the discharge of
their arrears of pay had been deferred by the son till the arrival of his
father. Summoning them, therefore, to a general <A NAME="p184"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|184</SPAN></A>
assembly, he proceeded to pacify them with soothing words, saying that &quot;pay
was not to be asked of him, but to be taken from the enemy; that they must gain
a common victory, and common spoil; and that they must continue to support him
for a short time, till what remained of the war was finished, as they were
certain that the capture of Carthage would satisfy all their desires.&quot; The
mutiny being thus allayed, he led the army, after an interval of some days,
against the camp of the enemy, but commencing an engagement too rashly, lost the
greater part of his force. Retreating to his camp, therefore, and finding the
odium of his rash engagement affecting his character, and dreading, at the same
time, a revival of the former murmurs at his failure in paying the arrears, he
fled from his camp at midnight, attended only by his son Archagathus. When the
soldiers heard of his departure, they were in no less consternation than if they
had been captured by the enemy, exclaiming that &quot;they had been twice
deserted by their leader in the midst of the enemy's country, and that the care
of their lives had been abandoned by him by whom not even their burial should
have been neglected.&quot; As they were going to pursue Agathocles, they were
met by some Numidians, and returned to the camp, but not without having seized
and brought back Archagathus, who, through mistaking his way in the night, had
been separated from his father. Agathocles, with the ships in which he had
returned from Sicily, and the men that he had left to guard them, arrived safe
at Syracuse; affording a signal instance of dishonourable conduct, a prince
deserting his army, and a father abandoning his children.
</p>
<p>In Africa, meanwhile, after the flight of Agathocles, his soldiers, making a
capitulation with the enemy, and putting to death the sons of Agathocles,
surrendered themselves to the Carthaginians. Archagathus, when he was going to
be killed by Arcesilaus, a former friend of his father, asked him &quot;what he
thought Agathocles would do to the children of him by whom he was rendered
childless?&quot; Arcesilaus replied, that &quot;he felt no concern, since he
knew that his children would certainly survive those of Agathocles.&quot; Some
time after, the Carthaginians sent new commanders into Sicily, to terminate what
remained of the war there, and Agathocles made peace with them on equal terms. <A NAME="p185"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|185</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p><b>I. </b> AGATHOCLES, sovereign of Sicily, having concluded a peace with the
Carthaginians, reduced, by force of arms, a part of the cities which, presuming
upon their strength, had thrown off their allegiance to him. Then, as if he were
confined within too narrow limits in an island (a part of the dominion of which,
even when he first began to rise, he could scarcely have hoped to obtain), he
proceeded, after the example of Dionysius,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> who had subdued many cities of
Italy, to cross, over into that country. His first enemies there were the
Bruttii, who, at that period, seem to have been the bravest and most powerful
people of the country, and to have been extremely ready to attack their
neighbours; for they had driven the inhabitants of many of the Greek cities from
Italy, and had conquered in war the Lucanians their founders, and made peace
with them on equal terms; such being the fierceness of their nature, that they
had no respect even for those to whom they owed their origin.
</p>
<p>The Lucanians were accustomed to breed up their children with the same kind
of education as the Spartans; for, from their earliest boyhood, they were kept
in the wilds among the shepherds, without any slaves to attend them, and even
without clothes <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> to wear or to sleep upon, that, from their first years, they
might be accustomed to hardiness and spare diet, having no intercourse with the
city. Their food was what they took in hunting, and their drink milk or water.
Thus were they prepared for the toils of war.
</p>
<p>Fifty of these people, who, at first, used to plunder the lands of their
neighbours, but who, as numbers flocked to join <A NAME="p186"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|186</SPAN></A>
them, increased in strength, and were tempted by hopes of greater booty,
disturbed the whole of the neighbouring country; and Dionysius, the tyrant of
Sicily, being wearied with complaints from his allies, had sent six hundred
Africans to put a stop to their ravages. But the marauders, having seized a fort
which the Africans had built, and which was betrayed into their hands by a woman
named Bruttia, proceeded to build a city there for the shepherds, who, at the
report of a new settlement, came in numbers to join them; and, from the name of
the woman, they called themselves Bruttii.
</p>
<p>Their first war was with the Lucanians, from whom tney sprung. Encouraged by
a victory over them, and making peace on equal terms, they subdued the rest of
their neighbours by force of arms, and acquired, in a short time, such
extraordinary strength, that they were thought formidable even by princes. After
some time, Alexander, king of Epirus,<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> coming into Italy with a great army to
the aid of the Greek cities, was cut off by them with all his force; and their
natural fierceness, increased by this success, was for a long time terrible to
all around them. At last Agathocles, being importuned to come over, set sail,
with the hope of enlarging his dominions, from Sicily to Italy.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> At the first news of his arrival, the Bruttii, alarmed at his name, sent
ambassadors to solicit alliance and friendship with him. Agathocles, inviting
them to an entertainment, that they might not see his army shipped over, and
appointing the next day for giving them audience, went off immediately after the
banquet in a vessel, and left them in the lurch. But what followed this deceit
was unhappy for him; for the violence of a disease <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
which he contracted obliged
him a few days after to return to Sicily. Being affected by the distemper
through his whole body, and a pestilential humour spreading through all his
nerves and joints, he was tormented, as it were, by an intestine war among all
his members. As his life was despaired of, a contention arose between his son
and grandson, each claiming the right of succession to his <A NAME="p187"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|187</SPAN></A>
power as if he were already dead; and the grandson, after killing the son,
got possession of the supreme dignity. Agathocles, therefore, when the pain of
his disease and his anxiety of mind were grown intolerable, the one being
increased by the severity of the other, resolved on embarking his wife Texena,
and two infant sons <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> that he had by her, with all his treasure, and servants,
and regal furniture (in which no king at that time was richer), and sending her
back to Egypt, from whence he had received her, fearing that they would find the
usurper of his power their enemy. His wife, however, long entreated that she
might not be separated from her sick husband, that the affliction of her
departure might not be added to the atrocities of his grandson, and that she
might not be made to appear as cruel in forsaking her husband as he in attacking
his grandfather; saying that, &quot;by marrying him, she not only engaged to
share his good fortune, but all his fortune; nor would she unwillingly purchase,
with the hazard of her own life, the privilege of receiving her husband's last
breath, and of performing, with all the care of conjugal duty and affection, the
last offices at his funeral, which, when she was gone, no one would take upon
himself to discharge.&quot; The little children, at parting, embraced and clung
to their father with doleful lamentations; while the wife, who was to see her
husband no more, could not desist from kissing him. Nor were the tears of the
old man less moving; the children wept for their dying father, the father for
his banished children. They bewailed the forlorn condition of their parent, a
sick old man; he lamented that his offspring, born to the prospect, of a throne,
should be left in want. At the same time the whole palace resounded with the
cries of those who were witnesses to so cruel a separation. The necessity for
departure, however, at length put a stop to their weeping, and the death of the
prince followed the leave-taking of his children.
</p>
<p>During these occurrences, the Carthaginians, learning the state of affairs in
Sicily, and thinking that an opportunity was afforded them of securing the whole
island, crossed over to it with a great force, and reduced several cities.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> At this time, too, Pyrrhus was engaged in a war with the Romans, and,
being entreated by the Sicilians, as has been said, <A NAME="p188"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|188</SPAN></A>
to come to their assistance,<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> and crossing, in consequence, over to Syracuse,
and taking several cities, received the title of king of Sicily as well as of
Epirus. Elated by this success, he destined for his son Helenus the kingdom of
Sicily, as an inheritance from his grandfather (for he was the son of
Agathocles's daughter), and to Alexander that of Italy. He then fought many
successful battles with the Carthaginians; but, after a time, ambassadors came
to him from his Italian allies, announcing that &quot;they could no longer
withstand the Romans, and that, unless he gave them assistance, they must
submit.&quot; Alarmed at this danger from another quarter, and uncertain what to
do, or whither first to direct his efforts, he took time, while he was in
suspense between the two, for consideration. As the Carthaginians threatened him
on one side, and the Romans on the other, it seemed hazardous not to transport a
force into Italy, and more hazardous to withdraw troops from Sicily, lest the
one should be lost by not receiving assistance, or the other by being deserted.
In this conflict of perils, the safer determination seemed to be, to bring the
struggle to an end, by exerting his utmost strength in Sicily, and then, after
having subdued the Carthaginians, to carry his victorious army into Italy. He
therefore fought a battle; but, though he had the advantage, yet, as he quitted
Sicily, he seemed to flee as one defeated; and his allies, in consequence,
revolted from him, and he lost his dominion in Sicily as speedily and easily as
he had obtained it.
</p>
<p>Experiencing no better success in Italy, he returned to Epirus. His fortune,
indeed, good and bad, was wonderful for the examples which it gave of both. For
as, at first, his good fortune, when his attempts succeeded even beyond his
wishes, had procured him empire in Italy and Sicily, and so many victories over
the Romans; so now his adverse fortune, overthrowing all that he had raised, as
if to afford an illustration of human instability, added to his failure in
Sicily the destruction of his fleet at sea, loss of honour in a battle with the
Romans, and an ignominious retreat out of Italy.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> When Pyrrhus had withdrawn from Sicily, Hiero was made governor of it;
and such was the prudence he displayed in his office, that, by the unanimous
consent of all the cities, <A NAME="p189"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|189</SPAN></A> he was first made general against the Carthaginians, and soon after king. The
fortune of Hiero, in his infancy, had been as it were a presage of his future
dignity. He was the son of Hierocles, a man of high rank, whose descent was
traced from Gelo an ancient prince of Sicily. His extraction on the mother's
side, however, was so mean as to be even dishonourable; for he was the child of
a female slave, and was in consequence exposed by his father as a disgrace to
his family. But, when he was thus left destitute of human aid, bees for several
days fed him with honey, which was heaped round him as he lay. Hence his father,
admonished by a communication from the soothsayers, who signified that sovereign
power was foreboded to the infant, took him home again, and brought him up most
carefully with the hope that he would attain the promised honour. As he was
learning his lesson at school, too, among his equals in age, a wolf, that
suddenly appeared in the midst of the boys, snatched from him his book. And when
he was grown up, and commencing his first campaign, an eagle settled on his
shield, and an owl upon his spear; a prodigy which indicated that he would be
prudent in counsel, active in the field, and a king. He fought frequently,
moreover, with persons that challenged him, and always gained the victory; and
he was presented by king Pyrrhus with many military gifts. The handsomeness of
his person was remarkable, and his bodily strength wonderful. He was affable in
his address, just in his dealings, moderate in command; so that nothing kingly
seemed wanting to him but a kingdom. <A NAME="p190"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|190</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b> DURING the course of these proceedings in Sicily, the kings, Ptolemy
Ceraunus <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> and Antigonus, quarrelling and going to war with one another in
Greece, almost all the cities of that country, under the Spartans as leaders,
encouraged as it were by the opportunity thus offered to entertain hopes of
recovering their liberty, and sending to each other ambassadors by whom leagues
might be formed to unite them, broke out into hostilities; and, that they might
not seem to commence war with Antigonus, under whose dominion they were, they
attacked his allies the Aetolians, making it a pretext for war with them, that
they had taken possession of the Cirrhaean plain, which by the unanimous consent
of Greece had been dedicated to Apollo. For their general in this war they
selected Areus, who, drawing together an army, laid waste the towns and
corn-fields lying in the plain, and burnt whatever he was unable to carry off.
When the shepherds of the Aetolians beheld this destruction from their
mountains, about five hundred of them assembling together, attacked the enemy as
they were dispersed, and knew not what was the number of their assailants (for
the sudden alarm, and the smoke of the fires, prevented them from ascertaining),
and having killed about nine thousand <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> of the depredators, put the rest to
flight. And when the Spartans afterwards renewed the war, many of the states
refused them their support, thinking that they sought dominion for themselves,
and not liberty for Greece.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the war between the princes that contended <A NAME="p191"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|191</SPAN></A>
for the throne of Macedonia was concluded, for Ptolemy, having routed
Antigonus and made himself master of the whole country, arranged a peace with
Antiochus, and contracted an affinity with Pyrrhus by giving him his daughter in
marriage.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> Having thus freed himself from the fear of foreign enemies, he turned his
impious and unprincipled mind to the perpetration of wickedness at home, and
contrived a plot against his sister Arsinoe,<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> to deprive her sons of life, and
herself of the possession of the city of Cassandrea. His first stratagem was to
pretend love to his sister, and to seek her hand in marriage, for he was unable
to come at his sister's sons, whose throne he had usurped, otherwise than by
counterfeiting affection for their mother. But the criminal intentions of
Ptolemy were understood by his sister. As she expressed distrust of him,
therefore, he assured her that &quot;he wished to share the kingdom with her
children, against whom he had not taken arms because he wished to wrest the
kingdom from them, but that he might have it in his power to present them with a
por.tion of it. She might therefore send a person to receive an oath from him,
in whose presence he would bind himself, before the gods of their country, by
whatever execrations she pleased.&quot; Arsino&euml;, not knowing what to do, was
afraid that if she sent any one, she would be deceived by a false oath, and
that, if she did not send, she would provoke her brother's fury and cruelty.
Fearing, therefore, less for herself than her children, whom she thought she
might protect by the marriage, she sent Dion, one of her friends, to him.
Ptolemy, after conducting him into the most sacred temple of Jupiter, held in
high veneration from of old among the Macedonians, took hold of the altar, and,
touching the images and couches of the gods, vowed, with unheard-of and most
solemn imprecations, that &quot;he sought a marriage with his sister in true
sincerity, and that he would give her the title of Queen, nor would, to her
dishonour, have any other wife, or any other children than her sons.&quot;
Arsino&euml;, being thus filled with hope, and relieved from apprehensions, held a
conference with her brother in person, and as his looks and flattering glances
promised no less sincerity than his oath, she agreed to marry <A NAME="p192"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|192</SPAN></A>
him, though her son Lysimachus <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> exclaimed that &quot;there was treachery at
the bottom.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> The nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence and general
rejoicings. Ptolemy, before the assembled army, placed a diadem on his sister's
head, and saluted her with the title of Queen. Arsino&euml;, overjoyed at the name,
as having regained what she had lost by the death of Lysimachus her former
husband, invited Ptolemy to her city Cassandrea; to get possession of which city
the plot was laid. Going thither before her husband, she appointed a festival in
the city against his arrival, ordering the houses, temples, and all other
places, to be magnificently decorated, altars and victims to be everywhere kept
in readiness, and her sons, Lysimachus who was sixteen years old, and Philip
three years younger, both remarkable for their comeliness, to go to meet him
with crowns on their heads. Ptolemy, to conceal his treachery, caressing them
with eagerness, and beyond the warmth of real affection, persisted for a long
time in kissing them. But as soon as he arrived at the gate, he ordered the
citadel to be seized, and the boys to be slain. They, fleeing to their mother,
were slain upon her lap, as she was embracing them; while Arsino&euml; exclaimed,
&quot;What monstrous crime had she committed,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
either in marrying or since her
marriage?&quot; She several times offered herself to the assassins in the room
of her children, and, embracing them, covered their bodies with her own,
endeavouring to receive the wounds intended for them. At last, deprived even of
the dead bodies of her sons, she was dragged out of the city, with her garments
torn and her hair dishevelled, and with only two attendants, and went to live in
exile in Samothracia; sorrowing the more, that she was not allowed to die with
her children. But the crimes of Ptolemy were not unpunished; for soon after (the
immortal gods inflicting vengeance on him for so many perjuries, and such cruel
murders), he was driven from his throne and taken prisoner by the Gauls, and
lost his life, as he had merited, by the sword.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> The Gauls, when the land that had produced them was unable, from their
excessive increase of population, to contain them, sent out three hundred
thousand men, as <i>a sacred spring,</i><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> <A NAME="p193"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|193</SPAN></A>
to seek new settlements. Of these adventurers part settled in Italy, and took
and burnt the city of Rome; and part penetrated into the remotest parts of
Illyricum under the direction of a flight of birds (for the Gauls are skilled in
augury beyond other nations), making their way amidst great slaughter of the
barbarous tribes, and fixed their abode in Pannonia. They were a savage, bold,
and warlike nation, and were the first after Hercules (to whom that undertaking
procured great admiration for his valour, and a belief in his immortality), to
pass the unconquered heights of the Alps, and places uninhabitable from excess
of cold. After having subdued the Pannonians, they carried on various wars with
their neighbours for many years. Success encouraging them, they betook
themselves, in separate bands, some to Greece, and some to Macedonia, laying
waste all before them with the sword. Such indeed was the terror of the Gallic
name, that even kings, before they were attacked, purchased peace from them with
large sums of money. Ptolemy alone, the king of Macedonia, heard of the approach
of the Gauls without alarm, and, hurried on by the madness that distracted him
for his unnatural crimes, went out to meet them with a few undisciplined troops,
as if wars could be despatched with &auml;s little difficulty as murders. An embassy
from the Dardanians, offering him twenty thousand armed men for his assistance,
he spurned, adding insulting language, and saying that &quot;the Macedonians
were in a sad condition, if, after having subdued the whole east without
assistance, they now required aid from the Dardanians to defend their country;
and that he had for soldiers the sons of those who had served under Alexander
the Great, and had been victorious throughout <A NAME="p194"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|194</SPAN></A>
the world.&quot; This answer being repeated to the Dardanian prince, he
observed that &quot;the famous kingdom of Macedonia would soon fall a sacrifice
to the rashness of a<i> </i>raw youth.&quot;<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
</p>
<p><b>V. </b> The Gauls, under the command of Belgius, sent deputies to Ptolemy to sound
the disposition of the Macedonians, offering him peace if he liked to purchase
it; but Ptolemy boasted to his courtiers that the Gauls sued for peace from fear
of war. Nor was his manner less vaunting before the ambassadors than before his
own adherents, saying that &quot;he would grant peace only on condition that
they would give their chiefs as hostages, and deliver up their arms; for he
would put no trust in them until they were disarmed.&quot; The deputies bringing
back this answer, the Gauls laughed, and exclaimed throughout their camp, that
&quot;he would soon see whether they had offered peace from regard for
themselves or for him.&quot; Some days after a battle was fought, and the
Macedonians were defeated and cut to pieces. Ptolemy, after receiving several
wounds, was taken, and his head, cut off and stuck on a lance, was carried round
the whole army to strike terror into the enemy. Flight saved a few of the
Macedonians; the rest were either taken or slain.
</p>
<p>When the news of this event was spread through all Macedonia, the gates of
the city were shut, and all places filled with mourning. Sometimes they lamented
their bereavement, from the loss of their children; sometimes they were seized
with dread, lest their cities should be destroyed; and at other times they
called on the names of their kings, Alexander and Philip, as deities, to protect
them; saying that &quot;under them they were not only secure, but conquerors of
the world;&quot; and begging that &quot; they would guard their country, whose
fame they had raised to heaven by the glory of their exploits, and give
assistance to the afflicted, whom the insanity and rashness of Ptolemy had
ruined.&quot; While all were thus in despair, Sosthenes, one of the Macedonian
chiefs, thinking that nothing would be effected by prayers, assembled such as
were of age for war, repulsed the Gauls in the midst of their exultation at
their victory, and saved Macedonia from devastation. For these <A NAME="p195"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|195</SPAN></A>
great services, he, though of humble extraction, was chosen before many
nobles that aspired to the throne of Macedonia. But though he was saluted as
king by the army, he made the soldiers take an oath to him, not as king, but as
general.
</p>
<p><b>VI. </b> In the meantime Brennus, under whose command a part of the Gauls had made
an irruption into Greece, having heard of the success of their countrymen, who,
under the leadership of Belgius, had defeated the Macedonians, and being
indignant that so rich a booty, consisting of the spoils of the east, had been
so lightly abandoned, assembled an army of a hundred and fifty thousand foot and
fifteen thousand horse, and suddenly invaded Macedonia. As he was laying waste
the fields and villages, Sosthenes met him with his army of Macedonians in full
array, but being few in number, and in some consternation, they were easily
overcome by the more numerous and powerful Gauls; and the defeated Macedonians
retiring within the walls of their cities, the victorius Brennus, meeting with
no opposition, ravaged the lands throughout the whole of Macedonia. Soon after,
as if the spoils of mortals were too mean for him, he turned his thoughts to the
temples of the immortal gods, saying, with a profane jest, that &quot;the gods,
being rich, ought to be liberal to men.&quot; He suddenly, therefore, directed
his march towards Delphi, regarding plunder more than religion, and caring for
gold more than for the wrath of the deities, &quot;who,&quot; he said,
&quot;stood in no need of riches, as being accustomed rather to bestow them on
mortals.&quot;
</p>
<p>The temple of Apollo at Delphi is situate<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> on Mount Parnassus, on a rock
steep on all sides. A concourse of people, who, collecting from the parts
around, through veneration <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> for the majesty of the god, settled on the rock,
formed a city there. Thus, not walls, but precipices, not defences formed by the
hand, but by nature, protect the temple and the city; so that it is utterly
uncertain whether the strength of the <A NAME="p196"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|196</SPAN></A>
place, or the influence of the deity residing in it, attracts more
admiration. The central part of the rock falls back in the shape of an
amphitheatre; and, in consequence, if ever shouts are raised, or if the noise of
trumpets is mingled with them, the sound, from the rocks echoing and re-echoing
to one another, is heard many times repeated, and louder than it was made at
first. This effect, on those who are ignorant of its cause, and are struck with
wonder at it, produces a greater awe of the power of the god. In the winding of
the rock, about half way up the hill; there is a small plain, and in it a<sup> </sup>deep
fissure in the ground, which is open for giving oracles; for a cold exhalation,
driven upwards by some force, as it were by a wind, produces in the minds of the
priestesses a certain madness, and compels them, filled with the influence of
the<sup> </sup>god, to give answers to such as consult them. Hence many rich
presents of kings and nations are to be seen there, which, by their
magnificence, testify the grateful feelings of those that have paid their vows,
and their belief in the oracles given by the deity.
</p>
<p><b>VII. </b> Brennus, when he came within sight of the temple, deliberated for some
time, whether he should at once make an attempt upon it, or should allow his
soldiers, wearied with their march, a night to refresh themselves. Two of the
captains, Emanus and Thessalorus, who had joined him for a share in the booty,
advised that &quot;no delay should be made,'' while the enemy were unprovided
for defence, and the alarm at their coming still fresh; that in the interval of
a night, the courage of the enemy would perhaps revive, and assistance come to
them; and that the approaches, which were now open, might be blocked up.&quot;
But the common soldiers, when, after a long endurance of scarcity, they found a
country abounding with wine and other provisions, had dispersed themselves over
the fields, rejoicing as much at the plenty as if they had gained a victory, and
leaving their standards deserted, wandered about to seize on everything like
conquerors. This conduct gave some respite to the Delphians. At the first report
that the Gauls were approaching, the country people are said to have been
prohibited by the oracle from carrying away their corn and wine from their
houses. The salutariness of this prohibition was not understood, until, through
this abundance of wine and other provisions being thrown in the way of the
Gauls, as <A NAME="p197"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|197</SPAN></A> a stop to their progress, reinforcements from their neighbours had time to
collect. The Delphians, accordingly, supported by the strength of their allies,
secured their city before the Gauls, who clung to the wine-skins, on which they
had seized, could be recalled to their standards. Brennus had sixty-five
thousand infantry, selected from his whole army; of the Delphians there were not
more than four thousand; in utter contempt of whom, Brennus, to rouse the
courage of his men, pointed to the vast quantity of spoil before them, declaring
that the statues, and four-horse chariots, of which a great number were visible
at a distance, were made of solid gold, and would prove greater prizes when they
came to be weighed than they were in appearance.
</p>
<p><b>VIII. </b> The Gauls, animated by these assertions, and disordered, at the same
time, with the wine which they had drunk the day before, rushed to battle
without any fear of danger. The Delphians, on the other hand, placing more
confidence in the god than in their own strength, resisted the enemy with
contempt, and, from the top of the hill, repelled the Gauls as they climbed up,
partly with pieces of rock, and partly with their weapons. Amidst this contest
between the two, the priests of all the temples,<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> as well as the priestesses
themselves, with their hair loose, and with their decorations and fillets,
rushed, trembling and frantic, into the front ranks of the combatants,
exclaiming that &quot;the god was come; that they had seen him leap down into
his temple through the opening roof; that, while they were all humbly imploring
aid of the deity, a youth of extraordinary beauty, far above that of mortals,
and two armed virgins, coming from the neighbouring temples of Diana and
Minerva, met them; that they had not only perceived them with their eyes, but
had heard also the sound of a bow and the rattling of arms;&quot; and they
therefore conjured them with the strongest entreaties, &quot;not to delay, when
the gods were leading them on, to spread slaughter among the enemy, and to share
the victory with the powers of heaven.&quot; Incited by these exhortations, they
all rushed eagerly to the field of battle, where they themselves also soon
perceived the presence of the divinity; for a part of the mountain, broken off
by an earthquake, overwhelmed a <A NAME="p198"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|198</SPAN></A> host of the Gauls, and some of the densest bodies of the enemy were scattered
abroad, not without wounds, and fell to the earth. A tempest then followed,
which destroyed, with hail and cold, those that were suffering from bodily
injuries. The general Brennus himself, unable to endure the pain of his wounds,
ended his life with his dagger. The other general,<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> after punishing the advisers
of the war,<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> made off from Greece with all expedition, accompanied with ten
thousand wounded men. But neither was fortune more favourable to those who fled;
for in their terror, they passed no night under shelter, and no day without
hardship and danger; and continual rains, snow congealed by the frost, famine,
fatigue, and, what was the greatest evil, the constant want of sleep, consumed
the wretched remains of the unfortunate army. The nations and people too,
through whom they marched, pursued their stragglers, as if to spoil them. Hence
it happened that, of so great an army, which a little before, presuming on its
strength, contended even against the gods, not a man was left <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
to be a
memorial of its destruction.

<p><b>I. </b> AFTER peace was made between the two kings, Antigonus and Antiochus, a new
enemy suddenly started up against Antigonus as he was returning to Macedonia.
The Gauls, who had been left behind by their general Brennus, when he marched
into Greece, to defend the borders of their country, armed fifteen thousand foot
and three thousand horse (that they alone might not seem idle), and having
routed the forces of the Getae and Triballi, and preparing to invade Macedonia,
sent ambassadors to Antigonus to offer him peace if he would pay <A NAME="p199"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|199</SPAN></A>
for it, and to play the part of spies, at the same time, in his camp.
Antigonus, with royal munificence, invited them to a banquet, and entertained
them with a sumptuous display of luxuries. But the Gauls were so struck with the
vast quantity of gold and silver set before them, and so tempted with the
richness of such a spoil, that they returned more inclined to war than they had
come. The king had also ordered his elephants to be shown them, as monsters
unknown to those barbarians, and his ships laden with stores to be displayed;
little thinking that he was thus exciting the cupidity of those to seize his
treasures, whom he sought to strike with terror by the ostentation of his
strength. The ambassadors, returning to their countrymen, and exaggerating every
thing excessively, set forth at once the wealth and unsuspiciousness of the
king; saying that &quot;his camp was filled with gold and silver, but secured
neither by rampart nor trench, and that the Macedonians, as if they had
sufficient protection in their wealth, neglected all military duties, apparently
thinking that, as they had plenty of gold, they had no use for steel.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> By this statement, the desires of a covetous people were sufficiently
stimulated to take possession of such spoil. The example of Belgius, too, had
its influence with them, who, a little before, had cut to pieces the army of the
Macedonians and their king. Being all of one mind, therefore, they attacked the
king's camp by night; but he, foreseeing the storm that threatened him, had
given notice to his soldiers to remove all their baggage, and to conceal
themselves noiselessly in a neighbouring wood; and the camp was only saved
because it was deserted. The Gauls, when they found it destitute not only of
defenders, but of sentinels, suspecting that there was not a flight, but some
stratagem on the part of the enemy, were for some time afraid to enter the
gates. At last, leaving the defences entire and untouched, and more like men
come to explore than to plunder, they took possession of the camp; and then,
carrying off what they found, they directed their course towards the coast.
Here, as they were incautiously plundering the vessels, and fearing no attack,
they were cut down by the sailors, and a part of the army that had fled thither
with their wives and children; and such was the slaughter among them that the
report of this victory procured Antigonus peace, not <A NAME="p200"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|200</SPAN></A>
only from the Gauls, but from his other barbarous neighbours.
</p>
<p>The nation of the Gauls, however, was at that time so prolific, that they
filled all Asia as with one swarm. The kings of the east then carried on no wars
without a mercenary army of Gauls; nor, if they were driven from their thrones,
did they seek protection with any other people than the Gauls. Such indeed was
the terror of the Gallic name, and the unvaried good fortune of their arms, that
princes thought they could neither maintain their power in security, nor recover
it if lost, without the assistance of Gallic valour. Hence, being called by the
king of Bithynia to his aid, and having gained him the victory over his enemies,
they shared his kingdom with him, and called their part of it Gallograecia.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> During these transactions in Asia, Pyrrhus, having been defeated by the
Carthaginians in a sea-fight on the coast of Sicily, sent ambassadors to
Antigonus king of Macedonia, to ask for a supply of troops, saying that,
&quot;unless he sent him some, he should be obliged to return to his kingdom,
and to seek that enlargement of his dominions from him,<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> which he had wished to
gain from the Romans.&quot; The ambassadors bringing word that his request was
refused, he pretended to be suddenly obliged to depart, but concealed his
reasons for doing so. Meanwhile he directed his allies to prepare for war, and
committed the citadel of Tarentum to the guardianship of his son Helenus and his
friend Milo. Returning to Epirus, he immediately invaded Macedonia; Antigonus
met him with an army, but was defeated in battle, and put to flight. Pyrrhus
then allowed the Macedonians to surrender on terms; and as if, by the
acquisition of Macedonia, he had made up for his loss of Sicily and Italy, he
sent for his son and his friend, whom he had left at Tarentum. Antigonus,
divesting himself at once of all the marks of royalty, repaired with a few
horsemen, that attended him in his flight, to Thessalonica, there to watch what
would follow on the loss of his throne, and to renew the war with a hired army
of Gauls. But being utterly defeated, a second time, by Ptolemy the son of
Pyrrhus, he fled <A NAME="p201"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|201</SPAN></A> with only seven followers, and no longer indulged hopes of recovering his
kingdom, but sought only hiding places for safety and solitary ways for flight.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> Pyrrhus, being raised to such a height of royal power, and not content
with what had once been the object of his wishes, began to contemplate the
subjugation of Greece and Asia. He had no greater delight in ruling than in
warfare; nor was any power able to withstand him, wheresoever he directed his
attack. But irresistible as he was deemed in conquering kingdoms, he also easily
lost those which he subdued and acquired, so much better did he manage to gain
dominion than to keep it.
</p>
<p>Having led his army into the Peloponnesus,<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> he was met by embassies from the
Athenians, Achaeans, and Messenians; and all Greece, indeed, struck with
admiration at his name, and at the glory of his achievements against the Romans
and Carthaginians, was eagerly looking for his arrival. His first contest was
with the Spartans, in which, being resisted with greater spirit by the women
than by the men, he lost his son Ptolemy and the flower of his army; for, when
he proceeded to attack the city, such a number of women assembled to defend
their birth-place, that he retreated, overcome not more by bravery on their part
than by shame on his own.
</p>
<p>As for his son Ptolemy, he is said to have been so brave and enterprising
that he took the city of Corcyra <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> with only sixty men. In a naval engagement,
too, he is reported to have leaped from a boat, with seven men, into a
fifty-oared galley, and to have taken and kept possession of it. At the attack
on Sparta he rode into the very middle of the city, and was there slain in a
crowd that gathered around him. When his body was carried to his father, he
exclaimed, it is said, &quot;that he had not been killed so soon as he had
feared, or his own rashness deserved.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>V. </b> Pyrrhus, on being repulsed by the Spartans, marched to Argos, where, while
he was endeavouring to capture Antigonus, <A NAME="p202"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|202</SPAN></A>
who was shut up in the city, and was fighting furiously among the thickest of
the assailants, he was struck with a stone from the walls, and killed. His head
was carried to Antigonus, who, using his victory with moderation, sent back his
son Helenus, who surrendered to him with several Epirots, into his own country,
and gave him the bones of his father, not having yet received the rites of
burial, to carry home with him.
</p>
<p>It is pretty generally stated by authors, that no king, either of that or the
former age, was to be compared to Pyrrhus; and that there has seldom been seen,
either among princes, or other illustrious men, a man of more upright life or of
stricter justice; and that he had such knowledge of the military art, that
though he fought against such great princes as Lysimachus, Demetrius, and
Antigonus, he was never conquered. In his wars too with the Illyrians,
Sicilians, Romans, and Carthaginians, he never came off inferior, but generally
victorious; and he rendered his country, which was before but mean and obscure,
renowned throughout the world by the fame of his exploits and the glory of his
name.

</blockquote>
<p>I. AFTER the death of Pyrrhus, there were great warlike commotions, not only
in Macedonia, but in Asia and Greece; for the Peloponnesians were betrayed into
the power of Antigonus; and while partly concern, partly exultation, prevailed
variously among the inhabitants, as any city had either expected aid from
Pyrrhus or conceived apprehensions of him, they either entered into alliance
with Antigonus, or, impelled by mutual animosity, plunged into hostilities with
one another Amidst these tumults in the disturbed provinces, the sovereignty
over the city of the Epeans <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> was usurped by an <A NAME="p203"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|203</SPAN></A>
eminent man named Aristotimus; and when many of the leading persons had been
slain by him, and more driven into banishment, and the Aetolians sent
ambassadors to ask him &quot;to give up the wives and children of the
exiles,&quot; he at first refused, but afterwards, as if relenting, he gave all
the married women leave to go to their husbands, and fixed a day for their
departure. They, as being about to spend their lives in banishment with their
husbands, were going to carry all their most valuable property with them; but,
when they assembled at one of the gates of the city, intending to go forth in a
body, they were despoiled of all that they had, and confined in the public
prison, the infants having been first killed in the arms of their mothers, and
the young women carried off for violation. The people being all amazed at such
cruel tyranny, Hellanicus, the chief of them, an old man and without children,
and consequently having no fear either for life or offspring, assembled the most
faithful of his friends in his house, and encouraged them to attempt the
delivery of their country. But as they hesitated to remove a public evil at
their own private risk, and demanded time for deliberation, Hellanicus, calling
for his attendants, ordered the doors to be locked, and a message to be carried
to the tyrant, requesting him &quot;to send officers to seize a band of
conspirators in Hellanicus's house;&quot; and he told all of them, with
reproaches, that &quot;since he could not be the deliverer of his country, he
would at least take revenge for the abandonment of its cause.&quot; Being thus
placed between two perils, they chose the more honourable course, and conspired
to kill the tyrant; and thus Aristotimus was cut off in the fifth month after he
had usurped the government.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> In the meantime Antigonus, being harassed with wars, of varied aspect,
from the Spartans and King Ptolemy, and perceiving that a new enemy, an army
from Gallograecia, was coming upon him, left a few troops as a semblance of a
camp, to amuse his other assailants, and proceeded with all the rest of his
force against the Gauls; who, becoming aware of his approach, as they were
preparing for battle, sacrificed victims <A NAME="p204"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|204</SPAN></A>
to take presages for the event; and as, from the entrails, great slaughter
and destruction of them all was portended, they were moved, not to fear, but to
fury, and thinking that the anger of the gods might be appeased by the slaughter
of their kindred, butchered their wives and children, commencing hostilities
with the murder of their own people; for such rage had possessed their savage
breasts, that they did not spare even that tender age which an enemy would have
spared, but made deadly war on their own children and their children's mothers,
in defence of whom wars are wont to be undertaken. As if, therefore, they had
purchased life and victory by their barbarity, they rushed, stained as they were
with the fresh blood of their relatives, into the field of battle, but with
success no better than their auspices: for, as they were fighting, the furies,
the avengers of murder, overwhelmed them sooner than the enemy, and the ghosts
of the slain rising up before their eyes, they were all cut off with utter
destruction. Such was the havoc among them, that the gods seemed to have
conspired with men to annihilate an army of murderers.
</p>
<p>In consequence of the result of this battle, Ptolemy and the Spartans,
avoiding the victorious army of the enemy, retreated to safer ground; and
Antigonus, when he heard of their departure, turned his arms against the
Athenians, while the ardour of his men was yet fresh from their recent victory.
But during the time that he was thus engaged, Alexander, king of Epirus, longing
to avenge the death of his father Pyrrhus, laid waste the frontiers of
Macedonia. Antigonus returned from Greece to give him battle, but being deserted
by his men, who went over to the enemy, he lost both the throne of Macedonia and
his army. His son Demetrius, however, though but a boy, collecting an army in
the absence of his father, not only recovered Macedonia, which had been lost,
but drove Alexander from the throne of Epirus, Such was the fickleness of the
soldiers, or the mutability of fortune, that kings were seen one day in the
character of sovereigns, and the next in that of exiles.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> Alexander, after fleeing, on his expulsion, to the Acarnanians, was
restored to his throne, with not less eagerness on the part of the Epirots than
exertion on the part of his allies. About the same time died Magas,<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> king of
Cyrene, <A NAME="p205"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|205</SPAN></A> who, before he fell sick, had betrothed his only daughter Berenice to his
brother Ptolemy's son, in order to end all disputes with him. But after the
death of the king, Arsino&euml;, the mother of the girl, resolving to break off a
marriage which had been contracted against her will, sent for Demetrius, the
brother of King Antigonus, from Macedonia, to marry the damsel, and occupy the
throne of Cyrene. Nor did Demetrius delay to comply with her wishes. But having
speedily arrived, by the aid of a favourable wind, at Cyrene, he began, from the
very first, through presuming on his handsome person (with which he had already
made too much impression on his mother-in-law<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>), to conduct himself haughtily
and overbearingly both to the royal family and the army. He also transferred his
desire to please from the daughter to the mother; a fact which was first
suspected by the damsel, and at last drew odium upon him from the people and the
army. The affections of all, therefore, being set on the son of Ptolemy, a
conspiracy was formed against Demetrius, and assassins were sent to kill him,
when he was gone to bed with his mother-in-law. Arsino&euml;, hearing the voice of
her daughter, standing at the door, and desiring them &quot;to spare her
mother,&quot; covered her paramour a while with her own person. He was however
slain, and Berenice, by his death, both took revenge for the licentiousness of
her mother, without violation of her duty to her, and, in choosing a husband,
followed the judgment of her father.

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b> ON the death of Antiochus, king of Syria, his son Seleucus, succeeding in
his stead, commenced his reign with murder in <A NAME="p206"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|206</SPAN></A>
his own family, his mother Laodice, who ought to have restrained him,
encouraging him to it. He put to death his step-mother Berenice, the sister of
Ptolemy, king of Egypt, together with his little brother, her son. By
perpetrating this cruelty, he both incurred the stain of infamy, and involved
himself in a war with Ptolemy. As for Berenice, when she heard that assassins
were sent to despatch her, she shut herself up in Daphne; and it being reported
throughout the cities of Asia, that she and her little son were besieged there,
they all, commiserating her undeserved misfortunes from their recollection of
the high character of her father and her ancestors, sent her assistance. Her
brother Ptolemy, too, alarmed at the danger of his sister, left his kingdom, and
hastened to her support with all his forces. But Berenice, before succour could
arrive, was surprised by treachery, as she could not be taken by force, and
killed. The deed was regarded by every one as an atrocity; and all the cities,
in consequence, which had revolted (after having equipped a vast fleet), being
suddenly alarmed at this instance of cruelty, and wishing to take revenge for
her whom they had meant to defend, gave themselves up to Ptolemy, who, if he had
not been recalled to Egypt by disturbances at home, would have made himself
master of all Seleucus's dominions. Such hatred did an unnatural crime bring
upon Seleucus; or so much good feeling did the death of a sister, dishonourably
killed, excite in behalf of Ptolemy!
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> After the departure of Ptolemy, Seleucus, having prepared a great fleet
against the cities that had revolted, lost it in a storm that suddenly arose, as
if the gods themselves had taken vengeance on him for his murder; nor did
fortune leave him anything, of all his mighty armament, except his body and
life, and a few companions amid the wreck. It was indeed a lamentable
occurrence, and yet such as Seleucus might have desired; for the cities, which
from hatred to him had gone over to Ptolemy, being moved, by a sudden change in
their feelings, to compassionate his loss at sea (as if, in the judgment of the
gods, satisfaction had been made them), put themselves again under his
government. Rejoiced at his misfortune, therefore, and enriched by his loss, he
made war upon Ptolemy, as being now a match for him in strength; but as though
he had been born only for a sport to fortune, <A NAME="p207"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|207</SPAN></A>
and had received the power of a king only to lose it, he was. defeated in a
battle, and fled in trepidation to Antioch, not much better attended than after
his shipwreck. From this place he despatched a letter to his brother Antiochus,
in which he implored his aid, and offered him that part of Asia within Mount
Taurus, as a recompense for his services. But Antiochus, though he was but
fourteen years old, yet, being greedy of dominion beyond his years, caught at
the opportunity, not with the kindly feeling with which it was offered, but,
like a robber, desiring to take the whole kingdom from his brother, assumed, boy
as he was, a manly and unprincipled audacity. Hence he was called Hierax,<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
because, in taking away the possessions of others, he conducted himself, not
like a man, but like a bird of prey.
</p>
<p>Ptolemy Euergetes, in the meantime, learning that Antiochus was coming to the
aid of Seleucus, and not wishing to have to contend with two enemies at once,
made peace with Seleucus for ten years. But the peace that was granted Seleucus
by his enemy, was broken by his own brother, who, having hired an army of Gauls,
brought hostilities instead of succour, and showed himself, though he had been
implored for aid, an enemy instead of a brother. In the battle that followed
Antiochus was victor, indeed, through the prowess of the Gauls; but they,
thinking that Seleucus had fallen on the field, began to turn their arms against
Antiochus himself, in the: hope of ravaging Asia with greater freedom, if they
destroyed the whole royal family. Antiochus, seeing their design, purchased
peace from them, as from robbers, with a sum of money, and formed an alliance
with his own mercenaries.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> Meanwhile Eumenes, king of Bithynia, when the brothers were divided and
exhausted by civil war, attacked both the victorious Antiochus and the Gauls, as
if he intended to take possession of Asia while it was left without a master.
Nor did he find any difficulty in overthrowing them, as they were weakened by
their previous conflicts, and he himself was fresh and vigorous. At that period,
indeed, every war was intended for the reduction of Asia; whoever was stronger
than his neighbours was ready to seize on Asia for his prey. The brothers,
Seleucus and Antiochus, went to war for the sovereignty of Asia; Ptolemy, king
of Egypt, under pretext of <A NAME="p208"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|208</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>avenging his sister, was eager to secure Asia. On the one side Eumenes of
Bithynia, on the other the Gauls (an army of mercenaries always ready to support
the weaker), laid waste Asia, while no one, among so many robbers, was found to
be its protector.
</p>
<p>When Antiochus was overthrown, and Eumenes had possessed himself of the
greater part of the country, the two brothers, though the prize for which they
had fought was lost, could not even then come to an agreement, but, leaving
their foreign enemies unmolested, continued the war for the destruction of each
other. Antiochus, being again defeated, and exhausted with a flight of many
days' continuance, arrived at last at the palace of Artamenes, his
father-in-law, king of Cappadocia. Being kindly received by him at first, but
learning, after some days, that treacherous designs were forming against him, he
sought safety by again taking to flight. When he was thus a fugitive, and found
nowhere a place of security, he betook himself to his enemy Ptolemy, whose faith
he thought more to be trusted than that of his brother, whether he reflected on
what he would have done to his brother, or what he had deserved from him. But
Ptolemy, not more friendly to him when he came to surrender, than when he had
been an open foe, ordered that he should be kept in the closest confinement.
From hence however he escaped, eluding his keepers by the aid of a courtesan,
with whom he had been familiar, and was slain in his flight by some robbers.
Seleucus too, about the same time, lost his kingdom, and was killed by a fall
from his horse. Thus these two brothers, as if brothers also in fate, both
became exiles; and both, after losing their dominions, died a death merited by
their crimes. <A NAME="p209"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|209</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p><b>I. </b> WHEN Olympias, daughter of Pyrrhus king of Epirus, had lost her husband
Alexander, who was also her brother,<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> she took upon herself the guardianship of
her sons Pyrrhus and Ptolemy, whom she had by him, and the administration of the
kingdom; and finding that the Aetolians wanted to take from her a part of
Acarnania, which the father of the boys had received as a recompense for
assisting them in war,<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> she addressed herself to Demetrius king of Macedonia,
and gave him her daughter Phthia in marriage (though he was already united to a
sister of Antiochus king of Syria), that she might secure by right of
relationship the assistance which she could not obtain from his compassion. A
marriage was accordingly solemnized, by which Demetrius gained the love of a new
wife, and the hatred of his former one; who, as if divorced, went off to her
brother Antiochus, and excited him to make war upon her husband.
</p>
<p>The Acarnanians also, fearing to trust for support to the Epirots, requested
of the Romans assistance against the Italians, and prevailed on the senate to
send ambassadors to order the Aetolians &quot;to withdraw their garrisons from
the cities of Acarnania, and allow those to be free, who alone, of all the
people of Greece, had not contributed aid to the Greeks against the Trojans, the
authors of the Roman race.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> But the Aetolians listened to the embassy of the Bo-mans with
haughtiness, upbraiding them with their fortune against the Carthaginians and
Gauls, by whom they had been fearfully slaughtered in so many wars, and saying
that &quot;their gates, which the terror of the Punic war had closed,<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> should
<A NAME="p210"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|210</SPAN></A> be opened to meet the Carthaginians, before their arms were brought into
Greece.&quot; They then desired them to remember &quot;who they were that
threatened, and whom they threatened. That the Romans had not been able to
defend their city against the Gauls; and, when it was taken, had recovered it,<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
not by the sword, but with gold; but that when that people entered Greece, in
considerably greater numbers, they themselves had utterly destroyed them, not
only without the assistance of any foreign power, but without even calling into
action the whole of their own force, and had made that a place for their graves
which they had intended for the seat of their cities and empire; while Italy, on
the other hand, when the Romans were still trembling at the recent burning of
their city, was almost entirely occupied by the Gauls. That they should
therefore have expelled the Gauls from Italy before they threatened the
Aetolians, and have defended their own possessions before they sought those of
others. And what sort of men were the Romans? mere shepherds, who occupied a
territory wrested from its lawful owners by robbery; who, when they were unable
to procure wives, from the baseness of their origin, seized them by open force;
who, moreover, had founded their very city in fratricide, and sprinkled the
foundation of their walls with the blood of their king's brother, But that the
Aetolians had always been the chief people of Greece, and, as they surpassed
others in dignity, excelled them also in bravery; that they were the only nation
who had always despised the Macedonians, even when flourishing in possession of
the empire of the world; who had felt no dread of king Philip, and who had
spurned the edicts of Alexander the Great, after he had conquered the Persians
and Indians, and when all trembled at his name. That they therefore advised the
Romans to be content with their present fortune) and not provoke the arms by
which they knew that the Gauls had been cut to pieces, and the Macedonians set
at nought.&quot; <A NAME="p211"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|211</SPAN></A> They thus dismissed the Roman embassy, and, that they might not seem to speak
more boldly than they acted, laid waste the borders of Epirus and Acarnania.
</p>
<p><b>III. </b>Olympias <A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> had now given up her dominions to her sons, and Ptolemy had
succeeded in the room of his deceased brother Pyrrhus. Ptolemy, as he was
marching to meet the enemy with his army in array, was seized with a fit of
sickness, and died on his route. Olympias too, afflicted with her double
bereavement in the death of her sons, and dragging on a suffering existence, did
not long survive her offspring. The young princess Nereis, and her sister
Laodamia, being then the only survivors of the royal family, Nereis married
Gelo, the son of the king of Sicily;<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> and Laodamia, fleeing for refuge to the
altar of Diana, was killed in a tumult<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A> of the populace; a crime which the
immortal gods punished by a series of disasters, and almost the total
destruction of the people; for after suffering from barrenness and famine, and
being harassed by civil discord, they were at length nearly cut off by foreign
wars; and Milo, the assassin of Laodamia, becoming mad, and lacerating his
flesh,<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A> sometimes with the sword, sometimes with stones, and at last with his
teeth, died the twelfth day afterwards.
</p>
<p>While these things were occurring in Epirus, king Demetrius in Macedonia
died, leaving a son named Philip, quite a child; and Antigonus, being appointed
his guardian, and marrying his mother, did his utmost <A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
to get himself made
king. But some time after, being besieged in the palace by an alarming
insurrection of the Macedonians, he walked forth publicly unattended by his
guards, and throwing his diadem and purple robe among the mob, bade them
&quot;give those to somebody else, who either knew not how to rule them,<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> or
<A NAME="p212"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|212</SPAN></A> whom they knew how to obey; for that he had found regal authority
enviable,<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
not for its pleasures, but for its toils and dangers.&quot; He then mentioned
his own services; &quot;how he had punished the defection of their allies; how
he had put down the Dardanians and Thessalians, when they were in exultation at
the death of king Demetrius; how he had not only maintained the honour of the
Macedonians, but added to it. Yet, if they were displeased at such services, he
was ready to resign the government, and to return what they had conferred upon
him; and they themselves might look out for a prince whom they could
govern.&quot; The people, overcome with shame, bade him resume the regal
authority; but he refused to do so till the leaders of the insurrection were
delivered up to punishment.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> After this occurrence he made war upon the Spartans, who were the only
people that, during the wars of Philip and Alexander, had set at nought the
power of the Macedonians, and those arms which were dreaded by every other
nation. Between these two most remarkable peoples war was prosecuted with the
greatest vigour on both sides, the one fighting to support the old glory of the
Macedonians, and the other, not only to secure their hitherto unviolated
liberty, but even their lives. The Lacedaemonians being worsted, not only the
men, but their wives and children, endured their adverse fortune with
magnanimity. As no man had shrunk from exposing his life in the field, so no
woman wept for her lost husband; the old men extolled the honourable deaths of
their sons, and the sons rejoiced over their fathers that were slain in battle;
and all who survived lamented their lot, in not having died for the liberty of
their country. All received the wounded with open doors, dressed their wounds,
and recruited them in their exhaustion. In this condition of affairs, there was
no noise or hurry in the city, and every one lamented the public suffering more
than his own private troubles. In the course of these proceedings, king
Cleomenes returned, with his whole body wet, after the great slaughter that he
had made among the enemy, with his own blood and that of his adversaries, and,
entering the city, did not rest himself on <A NAME="p213"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|213</SPAN></A>
the ground, or call for meat or drink, or even relieve himself from the
weight of his armour, but leaning against a wall, and finding that only four
thousand men survived the battle, exhorted them &quot;to reserve themselves for
the better times that would come to their country.&quot; He then set out with
his wife and children to Egypt to Ptolemy, by whom he was honourably received,
and lived a long time in the highest esteem with that monarch. After the decease
of Ptolemy, he was put to death, with all his family, by Ptolemy's son.
</p>
<p>Antigonus, when the Spartans were thus reduced, pitying the distress of so
famous a city, prohibited his soldiers from plundering it, and granted pardon to
all who survived, observing that &quot;he had engaged in war, not with the
Spartans, but with Cleomenes, with whose flight all his resentment was
terminated; nor would it be less glory to him, if Sparta should be recorded to
have been saved by him by whom alone it had been taken; and that he accordingly
spared the ground and buildings of the city, scarcely any inhabitants being left
for him to spare.&quot; Not long afterwards Antigonus died, and left the throne
to his ward Philip, who was then fourteen years old.

</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b> ABOUT this time almost all the kingdoms of the world underwent
alterations, in consequence of a succession of new princes. In Macedonia,
Philip, on the death of Antigonus his guardian, who was also his father-in-law,
assumed the government at the age of fourteen. In Asia, after Seleucus was
killed,<A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A> Antiochus, though still in his minority, was made king. In Cappadocia,
the father of Ariarathes, yet a boy, had resigned the sovereignty to him. Of
Egypt Ptolemy had made himself master, after putting to death his father and <A NAME="p214"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|214</SPAN></A>
mother; from which crime he had afterwards the surname of Philopator.<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> As for
the Spartans, they had elected Lycurgus in the room of Cleomenes. And that no
changes might be wanting at that period, Hannibal, at a very early age, was
appointed general of the Carthaginians, not for want of older men, but because
of his hatred to the Romans, with which they knew that he had been imbued from
his boyhood; the mischief that he did, however, was not so pernicious to the
Romans as to Africa itself. In these youthful rulers, although they had no
directors of maturer years, yet, as each was anxious to tread in the steps of
his predecessors, great talent and ability appeared. Ptolemy was the only
exception, who reckless as he had been in the attainment of power, was equally
remiss in the administration of it. As to Philip, the Dardanians, and all the
neighbouring people, who cherished. as it were, an immortal hatred to the kings
of the Macedonians, were perpetually molesting him in contempt of his youth. He,
on the other hand, after repulsing his enemies, was not content with having
defended his own dominions, but manifested the greatest eagerness to make war
upon the Aetolians.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> While he was meditating this enterprise, Demetrius king of the Illyrians,
who had lately been conquered by Aemilius Paulus, the Roman consul, applied to
him with earnest entreaties for aid, and complaints of the injustice of the
Romans, &quot;who,&quot; he said, &quot;not content within the limits of Italy,
but grasping, with presumptuous hopes, at the empire of the whole world, made
war upon all kings. Thus, aspiring to the dominion of Sicily, Sardinia, and
Spain, and finally to that of all Africa, they had engaged in a war with the
Carthaginians and Hannibal; and that hostilities had been directed against
himself too, for no other reason than that he appeared to lie near Italy, as if
it were unlawful for any king to be on the borders of their empire. And that
Philip also himself must take warning by his case, since the nearer <A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
and more
valuable his kingdom, the more determined enemies would he find the Romans to
be.&quot; In addition, he said, that &quot;he would give up his kingdom, which
the Romans had seized, to Philip himself <A NAME="p215"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|215</SPAN></A>
as he should be better pleased to see his ally, rather than his enemies, in
possession of his dominions.&quot; With such representations as these, he
prevailed upon Philip to lay aside his designs on the Aetolians, and to make war
upon the Romans; Philip supposing that there would be the less difficulty in the
undertaking, as he had heard that they had already been beaten by Hannibal at
the lake Trasimenus. Not to be distracted, therefore, with more than one war at
the same time, he concluded a peace with the Aetolians, not as if intending to
carry war elsewhere, but as if he wished to promote the tranquillity of
Greece, &quot;which,&quot; he asserted, &quot;had never been in greater danger,
as the new empires of the Carthaginians and Romans were rising in the west, who
forbore from attacking Greece and Asia only till they should decide their
dispute for the sovereignty by the sword, when the superior power of the two
would immediately invade the east.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b> III.</b> &quot;He contemplated therefore,&quot;
he said, &quot;that cloud of cruel and sanguinary war which was rising in Italy;
he contemplated the storm roaring and thundering from the west, which, to
whatever parts of the world the tempest of victory might carry it, would pollute
everything with a vast shower of blood. That Greece had frequently felt great
disturbances at one time from the wars of the Persians, at another from those of
the Gauls, at another from those of the Macedonians, but that they would think
all those to have been but trifling, if the force, which was now collecting in
Italy, should once pour itself forth from that country. He saw what cruel and
bloody conflicts those two powers were maintaining with each other, with all the
strength of their forces, and all the abilities of their generals; and that such
fury could not end with the destruction of one party only, without ruin to the
neighbouring people. That the cruel resolutions of the conquerors, it was true,
were less to be dreaded by Macedonia than by Greece; for Macedonia was both more
remote, and better able to defend itself; but he knew that those who contended
with such spirit would not be content with Greece as a limit to their conquests,
and that he himself should have to fear a conflict with the party that should
get the advantage.&quot; Concluding, on this pretext, the war with the
Aetolians, and thinking of nothing else but the contest of the Carthaginians and
Romans, he carefully weighed <A NAME="p216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A> the strength of each. But neither did the Romans, with the Carthaginians
<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> and Hannibal on their necks, appear free from apprehension of Macedonia; indeed,
both the ancient valour of the Macedonians, their glory in having conquered the
east, and the character of Philip, who was fired with the ambition of rivalling
Alexander, and whom they knew to be active and eager for the field, gave them
sufficient cause for alarm.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> Philip, as soon as he heard that the Romans had been defeated by the
Carthaginians in a second battle, openly declared himself their enemy, and began
to build ships for transporting an army into Italy. He then sent a deputy to
Hannibal with a letter, with the view of forming an alliance with him. This
deputy was taken prisoner, and brought before the senate, but released unharmed;
not from respect to the king, but that one who appeared still undetermined might
not be rendered a decided enemy. But afterwards, when news was brought to the
Romans that Philip was preparing to transport troops into Italy, they despatched
the praetor Laevinus, with a well appointed fleet, to hinder him from crossing.
</p>
<p>Laevinus, sailing over to Greece, prevailed on the Aetolians, by making them
numerous promises, to take up arms against Philip, who, on his side, solicited
the Achaeans to go to war with the Romans. Meanwhile the Dardanians began to
ravage the country of Macedonia, and, carrying off twenty thousand prisoners,
recalled Philip from his war with the Romans to defend his own territories. At
the same time the praetor Laevinus, having made an alliance with king Attalus,
proceeded to lay waste Greece; of which the several states, dismayed at such
calamities, importuned Philip with embassies for succour; while the princes of
the Illyrians, sticking close to his side, demanded, with constant
solicitations, the performance of his promises to them. In addition, the
plundered Macedonians called on him for vengeance. Beset by such and so many
difficulties, he was in doubt to what he should first turn his attention; but he
promised them all to send them assistance shortly; not that he was able to do
what he promised, but in order to keep them, by feeding them with hopes, in the
bond of alliance <A NAME="p217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A> with him. His first expedition, however, was against the Dardanians, who,
watching for his absence, were ready to fall on Macedonia with a still heavier
force. He made peace, too, with the Romans, who were well content to put off war
with Macedonia for a time. He laid a plot, moreover, for the life of
Philopoemen, strategus of the Achaeans, who, he understood, was soliciting some
of his allies to join the Romans; but Philopoemen, having discovered and escaped
the plot, induced the Achaeans, by the influence which he had with them, to
abandon Philip's cause.

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>I. </b> WHILE Philip was intent on great exploits in Macedonia, the conduct of
Ptolemy in Egypt was of an opposite character; for having got the throne by
parricide, and added the murder of his brother to that of both his parents, he
resigned himself, as if all had gone happily with him, to the attractions of
luxury; and the whole court had followed the manners of their king. Not only his
personal friends, and chief officers, but the whole of the army had laid aside
military exercises, and grown corrupt and enervated in idleness.
</p>
<p>Antiochus, king of Syria, when he heard of this state of things, and while
the old animosity between the two kingdoms incited him, captured many cities
belonging to Ptolemy by a sudden attack, and carried his arms into Egypt itself.
Ptolemy was accordingly in consternation, and endeavoured to retard Antiochus,
by sending embassies, until he could get troops in readiness. Having then hired
a large army in Greece, he fought a battle with good success, and would have
driven Antiochus from his throne, if he had supported his fortune with suitable
spirit. But, content with recovering the cities that he had lost, and making
peace, he eagerly seized the opportunity of sinking again into sloth, and,
returning to <A NAME="p218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A> his former licentious habits, he put to death his wife Eurydice, who was also
his sister, and gave himself up to the caresses of a mistress named Agathoclia;
and thus, forgetful of all the greatness of his name and dignity, he passed his
nights in wantonness, and his days in the pleasures of the table. As
ministrations to his luxury, timbrels and tabors <A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
were introduced; and the king,
no longer a mere spectator, but a leader of the revels, produced music from
stringed instruments himself. Such were at first the secret and latent pests of
a tottering court.
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> Licentiousness subsequently increasing, the audacity of his mistress
could no longer be confined within the walls of the palace; for the daily
debaucheries of the king, which he shared with her brother Agathocles, a corrupt
youth of captivating beauty, rendered her still more shameless. To all, this was
added, too, the influence of their mother Oenanthe, who, by the charms of her
two children, kept the monarch quite enthralled. Not content with enslaving the
king, they made themselves rulers of the kingdom; they showed themselves in
public places, received salutations, and were followed by a train of attendants.
Agathocles, attaching himself closely to the king's side, assumed the
administration of the state; women disposed of offices, governments, and
commissions; nor had any one less power in the kingdom than the king himself. In
the midst of this state of things the king died, leaving a son, five years old,
by his sister Eurydice; but his death, while the women were seizing on the royal
treasures, and endeavouring, by forming a confederacy with some desperate
characters, to get the government into their own hands, was for a long time
kept, secret. But the truth becoming known, Agathocles was killed by a rising of
the people, and the women nailed on crosses to avenge the death of Eurydice.
</p>
<p>After the king's decease, and when the infamy of the kingdom was expiated, as
it were, by the punishment of the courtezans, the people of Alexandria sent
ambassadors to the Romans, requesting them &quot; to take on themselves the
guardianship of the orphan, and to defend the kingdom of Egypt, <A NAME="p219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A>
which, they said, Philip and Antiochus had already portioned out between them
by a treaty made for the purpose.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>III. </b> This embassy was acceptable to the Romans, who were seeking a pretence
for making war upon Philip, for having formed designs against them in the time
of the Punic war. To this feeling was added the circumstance, that, since the
Carthaginians and Hannibal were conquered, there was no one of whose arms they
had a greater dread, considering what a commotion Pyrrhus, with but a small
force, had excited in Italy, and what exploits the Macedonians had achieved in
the east. Ambassadors were accordingly despatched to warn Philip and Antiochus
&quot;to make no attempt upon Egypt.&quot; Marcus Lepidus was also sent into
Egypt, to govern the orphan's kingdom in the character of guardian. During the
course of these proceedings, embassies from king Attalus, and from the Rhodians,
arrived at Rome, to complain of injuries that they had suffered from Philip.
These representations removed from the minds of the senate all hesitation about
going to war with Macedonia; and forthwith, under pretence of taking the part of
their allies, war was declared against Philip, and some legions, with one of the
consuls, were sent off to Macedonia. Not long after, too, the whole of Greece,
stimulated by confidence in the Romans, and the hope of recovering their ancient
liberty, to rise against Philip, made war upon him; and thus, being assailed on
every side, he was compelled to beg for peace. But when the terms of it were set
forth by the Romans, both Attalus and the Rhodians, as well as the Achaeans and
Aetolians, began to demand that the places belonging to them should be restored.
Philip, on the other hand, allowed that &quot;he might be induced to submit to
the Romans, but that it was intolerable that the Greeks, who had been subdued by
his ancestors Philip and Alexander, and brought under the yoke of the Macedonian
empire, should dictate articles of peace to him, as if they were conquerors; and
that they ought to give an account of their conduct in their state of slavery,
before they sought to recover their liberty.&quot; At last, on his request, a
truce was allowed for two months, that the peace, on which they could not come
to terms in Macedonia, might be obtained from the senate at Rome.
</p>
<p><b>IV. </b> In the same year <A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A> a concussion of the earth happened
<A NAME="p220"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|220</SPAN></A> between the islands Thera <A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
and Therasia, in the midst of the sea at an equal
distance from either shore, where, to the astonishment of those that were
sailing past, an island rose suddenly from the deep, the water being at the same
time hot. In Asia too, on the same day, the same earthquake shattered Rhodes,<A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
and many other cities, with a terrible ruin; some it swallowed up entire. As all
men were alarmed at this prodigy, the soothsayers predicted that &quot;the
rising power of the Romans would swallow up the ancient empire of the Greeks and
Macedonians.&quot;
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Philip, as his terms of peace were rejected by the senate,
prevailed on the tyrant Nabis <A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> to join him in prosecuting the war. Having then
led out his army into the field, he began to encourage his men, while the enemy
stood in array on the opposite side, by saying that &quot;the Persians,
Bactrians, and Indians, and all Asia to the utmost boundaries of the east, had
been subdued by the Macedonians; and that this war was more bravely to be
maintained than those which had preceded it, in proportion as liberty was more
precious than empire.&quot; Flamininus, too, the Roman consul, animated his men
to battle by representing what had lately been achieved by the Romans, observing
that &quot;Carthage and Sicily on one side, and Italy and Spain on the other,
had been thoroughly reduced by Roman valour; and that Hannibal, <A NAME="p221"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|221</SPAN></A>
by whose expulsion from Italy they had become masters of Africa, a third part
of the world, was not to be thought inferior to Alexander the Great. Nor were
the Macedonians to be estimated by their ancient reputation, but by their
present power; for that the Romans were not waging war with Alexander the Great,
whom they had heard called invincible, or with his army, which had conquered all
the east, but with Philip, a youth of immature years,<A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A> who could scarcely defend
the frontiers of his dominions against his neighbours, and with those
Macedonians who were not long ago a prey to the Dardanians. That they might
recount the achievements of their forefathers, but that he could relate those of
his own soldiers;<i> </i>since Hannibal and the Carthaginians, and almost all
the west, had not been conquered by any other army, but by those very troops
which he had with him in the field.&quot; The soldiers on both sides, roused by
these exhortations, rushed to the encounter, the one army exulting in their
conquest of the east, the other in that of the west; the one carrying to the
battle the ancient and fading glory of their ancestors, the other the flower of
valour fresh from recent exertions. But the fortune of Rome was superior to that
of the Macedonians; and Philip, exhausted by his efforts in war, and suing for
peace from Flamininus, the consul, was allowed to retain indeed the name of
king; but, being deprived of all the cities of Greece, as being parts of his
dominion beyond the bounds of its ancient territory, he preserved only
Macedonia. The Aetolians, however, were displeased, because Macedonia was not
taken from the king at their suggestion, and given to themselves as a reward for
their service in the war, and sent ambassadors to Antiochus, to induce him, by
flattering his greatness, to engage in a war with the Romans, in the hope of
securing the alliance of all Greece.

</p>
<p><A NAME="#36"></A>36.&nbsp;* <i>Cherroneson.</i>] The old reading was <i>Cherroneso, </i>which was
considered as a dative, and is still retained in some modern editions. J. F.
Gronovius altered it to <i>Cherroneson, </i>the preposition <i>in </i>being
understood.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#37"></A>37.&nbsp;+ The chief town of the island of Corcyra. See Pausanias in Att. c. ii. 6,
where the attack on this island is mentioned.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#38"></A>38.&nbsp;* <i>Epiorum urbs</i>.] Called by the Greeks <i><font face="SPIonic">1Epeioi</font></i>,<i> </i>from
Epeus, a king of Elis, contemporary with Pelops, Hom. Odyss. xiii. 275; xv. 297; so that
the Epeans, in this passage, are only the Eleans under their old name.---- <i>Wetzel.
</i>Bongarsius and Gronovius would read <i>Eliorum, </i>referring to Pausanias,
Eliac. and Plutarch, de Virt. Mul. c. 24.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#39"></A>39.&nbsp;* Wetzel has <i>Agas </i>in his text, but says in his note that &quot;we
should rather read <i>Magas, </i>as the name is written by Polyaenus, Athenaeus, and
Pausanias, i. 6, 8.&quot; <i>Magas </i>is also approved by Vossius, Vorstius,
Faber, and almost all the other commentators.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><A NAME="#40"></A>40.&nbsp; * Arsino&euml;.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#41"></A>41.&nbsp; * <i><font face="SPIonic">9Ie/rac</font></i>,<i> </i>a hawk or falcon.</p>
<p><A NAME="#42"></A>42.&nbsp;* Compare xviii. 1; xxvi. 2. His death is not mentioned
before.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#43"></A>43.&nbsp; + <i>In
portionem belli.</i>] He had become an ally to the Aetolians when they were
carrying on some war.---- <i>Wetzel.&nbsp;</i>
</p>
<p><A NAME="#44"></A>44.&nbsp;<i> ++ Quas clauserit metus Punici belli.</i>]
The author seems to have been thinking of the second Punic war, which Hannibal commenced, A.U.C. 534, and
ended in 551. If so, he inadvertently makes the Acarnanians, before A.U.C. 522,
speak of matters which did not take place till more than twelve years
afterwards.---- <i>Wetzel.</i>
</p>
<p><A NAME="#45"></A>45.&nbsp;<i>* </i>The text, in all the editions, stands thus: <i>Captamque non ferro
defendisse, sed auro redemisse. </i>As <i>captam urbem defendere </i>is
nonsense, I have, in accordance with the judgment of Scheffer, omitted the word <i>defendisse
</i>in the translation.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#46"></A>46.&nbsp;* See note at the commencement of this book.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#47"></A>47.&nbsp;+ Hiero, who reigned from B.C. 263 to 214. Gelo died three years before his
father. Liv. xxiii. 30.---- <i>Wetzel.&nbsp;</i>
</p>
<p><A NAME="#48"></A>48.&nbsp;<i> ++</i> The cause of this disturbance does
not appear.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><A NAME="#49"></A>49.&nbsp; &sect; <i>Visceribus</i>.] &quot;Viscera&quot; signifies all that is
under the skin. &quot;Viscera sunt quicquid inter ossa et cutem est.&quot;
Servius ad Virg. <i>Aen., </i>vii. 253; Lucret. i. 836.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><A NAME="#50"></A>50.&nbsp; || <i>Laborabat.</i>]
And succeeded.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#51"></A>51.&nbsp; <i>Qui aut imperare illis nesciat</i>.] That is, whom they might rule (as
he says at the end of his speech), if the reading be correct. But some of the
old editions have <i>sciat, </i>which Vorstius adopted. Scheffer would read <i>qui aut imperare illis, aut cui parere ipsi
sciant </i>&quot;sciat&quot;
being understood after &quot;imperare.&quot;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><A NAME="#52"></A>52.&nbsp; * That is if it were to be envied
at all.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#53"></A>53.&nbsp;* <i>Interfecto Seleuco.</i>] See the end of book xxviii. This was Seleucus
II, named Callinicus.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#54"></A>54.&nbsp;* <i>Father-loving, </i>ironically.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#55"></A>55.&nbsp;+ Wetzel has <i>promptius </i>in his text, with most other editors,
but in his note, prefers <i>propius, </i>which appears in some editions.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#56"></A>56.&nbsp;* All the editions have <i>Sed nec Romani, tametsi Poeni et Hannibal in
cervicibus erant, </i>&amp;c. But <i>tametsi, </i>as Wetzel notices, has no
place here. Six of the old editions, he adds, have <i>quibus </i>instead of it.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#57"></A>57.&nbsp;* <i>Tympana et crepundia</i>.]<i> </i>It is impossible to ascertain exactly
what musical instruments are meant by <i>crepundia. </i>Lemaire supposes them to
be something like the Egyptian <i>sistra, </i>used in the ceremonies of Isis.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#58"></A>58.&nbsp;* No;<i> </i>for it was several years before that this
commotion of the
earth took place, namely, in the first year of the 139th Olympiad, as is
apparent from Polybius, v. 88, and the Chronicon of Eusebius. But Pliny, H. N.
ii. 87, says that Automata or Hiera, the island here signified, arose between
Thera and Therasia in the second year of the 156th Olympiad; how this can be
correct, I do not understand.----<i>Is. Vossius. </i>Vossius, however, is not
quite right in his computation. Pliny says that Thera and Therasia sprung from
the sea in the fourth year of the 135th Olympiad, and that Automata or Hiera
arose one hundred and thirty years afterwards; this would be in the third year
of the 167th Olympiad. Concerning the rise of this island from the deep, see
Strabo, i. 3; Sen. Nat. Quaest. vi. 21; ii. 26; it is also noticed by Livy,
xxxix. 56, and Amm. Marcell. xvii. 6. Other islands have since risen in these
parts. See Virlet, Bull. de la Soc. Geol. de France, tom. iii.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#59"></A>59.&nbsp;* The largest of the Sporades in the Aegean Sea, now called <i>Santorin. </i>Therasia
lies near it. Hiera is not <i>exactly </i>between the two islands, as Justin
represents.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#60"></A>60.&nbsp;+ Diodorus, xviii. 8, assigns this island to Europe. The epitome of the 78th
book of Livy, however, gives it to Asia.----<i>Berneccerus.</i>
</p>
<p><A NAME="#61"></A>61.&nbsp;++ Tyrant of Sparta. He began to reign B.C. 206.
</p>
<p><A NAME="#62"></A>62.&nbsp;* <i>Puero immaturae aetatis.</i>] Why does he call him <i>puero, </i>a
youth, when, in the year B.C. 220, in which he succeeded Antigonus, he had
completed his fourteenth year? See xxviii. 4. In this year, therefore, B.C. 198,
he was in his thirty-sixth year.---- <i>Wetzel. </i>So that Philip had now
attained a greater age than Alexander the Great lived to attain. Scheffer would
strike out <i>puero, </i>asking whether there are also <i>pueri maturae aetatis?</i></p>
