<p>[508-511(?)] As regards these things therefore I think that we ought to avoid
this composite term, that we should call the Holy Trinity or the Father
uni-essential, both because it is not found among the accurate fathers, and<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#470"><SUP>470</SUP></A>
it gives occasions for the evil deviations of the heretics: but they called the
Trinity co-essential, in order that by means of this word so plainly and very
excellently stated there might be expressed in the same phrase both the oneness
of the essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#471"><SUP>471</SUP></A> and the separation of the
hypostases, and by means of this one word unity and division: for by being
called co-essential with the Father and the Holy Spirit the Son claims to share
essence<sup>3</sup> with those who are reckoned with him, but to be distinct in
hypostasis; for a man is not co-essential with himself, but one man with
another. <A NAME="p174"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|174</SPAN></A></p>

<p>[519-33.] When<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#474"><SUP>474</SUP></A> therefore Adam was stripped
of the blessedness of immortality, and was thereafter destined to be cast into
the earth by means of death, then only there was introduced, as being necessary,
the process of the generation of children, which preserves a succession to our
race by means of the intercourse of copulation, and by means of the partnership
of male and female, in the manner in which the quadrupeds also increase and
multiply by generation. And for this reason also the flow comes from the very
members which point downwards, and intercourse and birth do not take place from
any other, in order that we may learn that it was from a high and heavenly
position that we flowed down to this lowly state. <A NAME="p175"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|175</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[513-8.] For those therefore who wish to learn the purport of what has been
written by me in brief and in few words it was right that these things should be
put forward: but to those who desire to know the reasons and the argument <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#477"><SUP>477</SUP></A>
contained in this composition let the whole letter be given. But it is certain
that even a man who has received summaries of what has been said will need the
whole: for a summary is an epitome of many words; therefore he must first know
those many words in order to know of what things it is an epitome. Otherwise the
result will be that we shall be putting forward empty words devoid of sense,
like those perhaps who desired to speak with tongues only, whom Paul reproves,
saying, «For, if I prayed <A NAME="p176"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|176</SPAN></A> in a
tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful»: and afterwards
he adds what he thinks right, saying, «I will pray with my spirit, but I will
pray also with my understanding. I will sing with my spirit, but I will sing
also with my understanding» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#478"><SUP>478</SUP></A>. And I therefore,
making a slight change, say: It is right to argue with words; but it is right to
argue also with the understanding. I do not know if any of the God-clad fathers
pronounced it right for us to speak in brief when giving teaching; for in these
matters it is a welcome thing if even by expending the whole power of speech
that is in us we utter a small portion and that in obscure form of what the
intellect has gathered.</p>

    THE LETTER OF THE SAME HOLY SEVERUS TO EUPRAXIUS THE CHAMBERLAIN <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#479"><SUP>479</SUP></A>,
    AND ABOUT THE QUESTIONS WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO HIM.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>[508-11.]&nbsp; (<i>And the first question is this, as to how we say that God
the Word was begotten without beginning by the Father: and the beginning of the
letter is this: </i>«You, <A NAME="p177"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|177</SPAN></A>
God-loving Eupraxius, are smitten with divine love»: <i>and a little farther on
the defence</i>)<i>. </i>First therefore you seek to learn how we say that God
the Word was begotten without beginning by the Father. But I from the very
appellation 'Father' say that the generation of the Son is without beginning. If
the Father was from eternity, the Son also, who shows forth the Father, existed
from eternity: for, if there was a time when the Son did not exist, there was
then a time when the Father was not a father. We, because we are a corruptible
nature, come into being in time, and again pass away from being: therefore also
the names applied to us vary; and at one time we are sons of certain persons,
and after this we cease to be sons, and we become fathers, and we beget others.
But God is in his nature invariable, and he is as he is from eternity, and he is
a father from eternity. And the Son became such to eternity, and the Son is a
son who is from eternity, and he was begotten everlastingly by the Father, and
he did not acquire for the Father from outside the status of a father, because
the Son was begotten by him without beginning and without time. If we say that
the Son is the wisdom and the power of the Father in accordance with the wise
Paul's <A NAME="p178"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|178</SPAN></A> saying, «Christ is the
power of God and the wisdom of God»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#480"><SUP>480</SUP></A>, how is it
not beyond all impiety for us to presume to say that the Father ever appeared
without wisdom or without power? But, if he is wise from eternity, and he is
powerful from eternity, then he has also wisdom and power from eternity, which
is Christ: for he is the ray of the glory of the Father, and the impress of his
hypostasis<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#481"><SUP>481</SUP></A>. As the sun from which it. shines is
the cause of the ray, and the sun is a circle and orb, and, so to speak, a
composition, and the ray that comes from it is the light that is emitted and
lightens everything under heaven, the land I mean and the sea at the same time,
and one can never see the sun without the ray that comes from it, but, when you
hear of the sun, then you also without separation think of and understand the
light that comes from it, that which gives light and that which is lightened by
it, for it is from it, and is not after it, so also from the everlasting and
suprasensual light, which is the Father, the Son shone forth without beginning
and everlastingly, who himself also is the suprasensual ray which proceeds from
him by generation, and does not appear after him. And, as when we hear the
divine Scripture calling the Son a ray, <A NAME="p179"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|179</SPAN></A>
we think of the Father from whom, he radiated, so, when we hear that he is the
Word of God, according to the passage, «In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#482"><SUP>482</SUP></A>, we regularly think of the
Father who is the subject of the Word, who begot the Son from his own nature
without passion, the Word so to speak of a great intellect, and the messenger in
whom he displays and makes known and on whom he impresses the hypostasis of the
Father, who is a great intellect, and a mind above all . things. And, as our
mind begets the word without passion, and makes known the thought that is in the
heart, and the word is a true image of the mind and an exact likeness, and in
conjunction with the word, so to speak, there proceeds forth, also the emission
of the breath of the mouth, in the same way from the essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#483"><SUP>483</SUP></A>
of the Father also the Son proceeds by way of birth, and the Holy Spirit by way
of procession. And of the person of the Son who is the wisdom of the Father it
is written, «I was born before all the mountains» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#484"><SUP>484</SUP></A>,
and about the Spirit it is said, «The Holy Spirit which proceedeth from the
Father» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#485"><SUP>485</SUP></A>. And the divine Scripture does not
use such words at random, saying that the Son is begotten and the Spirit
proceeds, <A NAME="p180"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|180</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb> <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#486"><SUP>486</SUP></A></SPAN>
but that we may not confuse the hypostases, and that <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#487"><SUP>487</SUP></A>
we may know definitely that the Son is one in his hypostasis, and the Holy
Spirit another, and that, though they are both from the same essence<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#488"><SUP>488</SUP></A>,
and from the same one Father, one is begotten and the other proceeds: whence it
follows that the Holy Spirit is not the Son; for he is not begotten but
proceeds. But, if anyone say, «How is the Son begotten, and how does the Spirit
proceed?», we discreetly say that it is as the Father knows that he begot and
the Son that he was begotten, and the Spirit that he is from the Father; but
this even the very angels are not allowed to understand, and we too will not
contuse ourselves by investigating it. But, inasmuch as we are variable, our
mind, being subject to variations and changes, emits a word that proceeds and is
dissolved in the air <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#489"><SUP>489</SUP></A>, and a breath in the same
way that as soon as it proceeds is diffused over the same air<sup>3</sup>. But
God and the Father, the living and <A NAME="p181"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|181</SPAN></A>
hypostatic mind, being incorruptible and invariable, and everlastingly the same,
consequently begets a living and hypostatic Word, and emits a living and
hypostatic Spirit. And, as the Father is the Creator, so the Son is the Creator,
and the Holy Spirit: for 'by the word of the Lord were the heavens established,
and by the spirit of his mouth all the strength of them'<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#490"><SUP>490</SUP></A>:
and, since they are of the same essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#491"><SUP>491</SUP></A> of the
Father, they are of necessity <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#492"><SUP>492</SUP></A> </sup>of
the same glory and kingship and eternity; for the fact that they are of the same
essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#491"><SUP>491</SUP></A> brings with it identity in every
respect. And, when we hear of the Son, we immediately understand that he himself
is of the same essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#491"><SUP>491</SUP></A> as the Father; for
every father certainly begets a son of the same essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#491"><SUP>491</SUP></A>
as himself. Thus also from every appellation <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#493"><SUP>493</SUP></A>
we draw <A NAME="p182"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|182</SPAN></A> God-befitting thoughts
about the Son, from that of 'ray' the thought of co-eternity with the Father,
from that of 'Word' impassibility of birth, from that of 'Son' the thought of
co-essentiality. It is impossible for us in one appellation or illustration to
comprehend all the attributes that exist in the divine nature, because it is
without likeness and without peer: but, when we receive from each of the names
that which is God-befitting, we dismiss all the other things and let them remain
below. When we speak of the divine nature, we mean the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit, separating the hypostases, but&nbsp; <A NAME="p183"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|183</SPAN></A>
uniting the Godhead. And, as the name 'Father' and the fact that he is not
begotten by anything is the peculiar characteristic of the hypostasis of the
Father, so also the name 'Son' and the fact that he is begotten by the Father is
the peculiar characteristic of the hypostasis of the Son: similarly also the
appellation 'Holy Spirit' and the fact that he is not begotten but proceeds from
the Father is the peculiar characteristic of the hypostasis of the Holy Spirit.
While therefore the hypostases or persons are recognised by the peculiar
characteristics, and the Father is not converted into the Son or the Holy
Spirit, nor does the Son pass into the Holy Spirit or the Father, nor yet is the
Holy Spirit transformed so as to become the Father or the Son, the three are
one, in that they are of the same essence of the Godhead; for the Father is God,
and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, and, while <A NAME="p184"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|184</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>the hypostases remain unconfused, the Trinity is invariable in all
points: for its essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#494"><SUP>494</SUP></A> is one, its glory one,
its everlastingness one, its kingship one, its power one, its will one, its
operation one, and through it we hold that the Trinity is one God. And, though
each appears by himself, yet there is one Godhead, in the same essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#495"><SUP>495</SUP></A>......the
Son the fact that he is begotten, and the Spirit the fact that he proceeds. And
these are from the Father as from a root and we refer their Godhead eternally
and timelessly to one first cause, to the Father, and so the principle of a
single first cause is preserved. For we do not hold several first causes, but we
reject the Jewish poverty also which sees little,, and do not confine the
Godhead in one person, and at the same time we know and think of three
hypostases in one essence<sup>1</sup>, and one identity of honour, and do not
divide it into a trinity of first causes, and shun the polytheism of the pagans.</p>
<p>(Of Cyril, from the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Treasure. «As the sun is
in the ray that proceeds from it, and the ray in the sun from which it
proceeded, <A NAME="p185"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|185</SPAN></A> and in the word is the
intellect which begot it, and in the river the fount that sent it forth, and in
the image the original, so the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father,
as he says, 'He who hath seen me hath seen the Father', and, 'I and my Father
are one', and, 'I am in my Father, and my Father in me', being numerically
divided into a duality, and being so in hypostases, but in that they are one in
nature restricted to one Godhead») <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#496"><SUP>496</SUP></A>. Next the
second question, 'Why and in what way do we say that God the Word was
humanized?'. The defence. But now it is reasonable to consider why and in what
way we say that the only Word, the Son of God, was humanized; for this is the
second question that you put. But we without going outside the divine Scriptures
say that the reason for which he shone upon and gave light to this world by the
coming of his Humanization in the flesh was that, as in Adam we die, so in
Christ himself we might live <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#497"><SUP>497</SUP></A>, and, as it is
said, «By man is death, so also by man is the resurrection of the dead» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#498"><SUP>498</SUP></A>.
Since Adam was condemned to death after the transgression which was committed
through the deceitfulness of the serpent, and heard the words, <A NAME="p186"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|186</SPAN></A>
«Dust thou art and to dust shalt thou return», and, «Cursed is the ground in
the work of thine hands», and, «In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy
bread», and Eve too was also condemned with him by hearing the words, «In
pains shalt thou bear children» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#499"><SUP>499</SUP></A>, so with us
also who are sprung from them the charges of disobedience have been confirmed,
and we ourselves are dust and to dust we return, and we are condemned to the
curse and are creatures born in pains: and from that time we have been in
subjection, being subject to lust and to the varied pleasure of this, according
to the saying of the blessed Paul <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#500"><SUP>500</SUP></A>. For it was
right that against the cunning contriver of evil, the serpent and the destroyer
of our life, we should contend with him with the same weapons (?) <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#501"><SUP>501</SUP></A>
with which he deceived those founders of our race: and, since it was not the
part of another power to annul the punishment fixed by our Lord himself, he did
not send an envoy nor an angel, but, as Isaiah cries, the Lord himself saved us <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#502"><SUP>502</SUP></A>.
The only God the Word who is before the ages, the power and wisdom of the
Father, in whose image he created rational man, became flesh, I mean man
according to the words of «John <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#503"><SUP>503</SUP></A>, not that he
was changed into flesh (far be it!), but, while he remained invariable as God,
he himself assumed the whole of me by a true <A NAME="p187"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|187</SPAN></A>
and hypostatic union, but still without the sin which had come in upon us <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#504"><SUP>504</SUP></A>.
For, immediately after Gabriel had made announcement to the Virgin and said to
her, «Rejoice greatly, thou that art made glad, the Lord is with thee»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#505"><SUP>505</SUP></A>,
at the very moment of time, we believe that God the Word himself came to dwell
in her womb, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit, and olthe very leaven of the
holy Virgin, in flesh of our nature possessing an intelligent soul. For he says,
«That which is born in thee is of the Holy Spirit» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#506"><SUP>506</SUP></A>,
since the Holy Spirit .operatively effected the fertilization of the conception,
while Mary contributed the birth according to the natural manner of mothers.
Wherefore also the period of conception was one of nine months (for he says, «But,
when the days were accomplished that she should bring forth» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#507"><SUP>507</SUP></A>),
and all these things were devoid of phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#508"><SUP>508</SUP></A>,
since he who was conceived took the seed of Abraham <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#509"><SUP>509</SUP></A>:
for a descendant of Abraham is the Virgin, who also is of our nature, from whom
the Lord took flesh and became a babe. For he himself became a babe, and the
babe was not first formed separately, while he afterwards came to be with him by
way of indwelling, as those who divide him into two natures say. This unsound
opinion is <A NAME="p188"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|188</SPAN></A> rejected by the blessed
Paul when he says, «For, since the children partook of flesh and blood, he
himself also similarly partook of the same, in order that through death he might
destroy him who hath the power of death, who is the devil» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#510"><SUP>510</SUP></A>.
If then <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#511"><SUP>511</SUP></A> he partook of flesh and blood
similarly to the children and in the same way, it is plain that, as the soul of
a man is born with its own body, though in its nature it is incorporeal, but is
nevertheless reckoned to be one with it because of the union, so too he who was
born is also said to be united to the body that was born that has a rational and
intelligent soul. And, as you do not say that a man's soul passed into flesh,
although it is united with the body by an original union, so also no one says
that God the Word was changed into flesh and endured the process of mingling,
because he is hypostatically united to a body. Wherefore, when he was born, he
made the Virgin the God-bearer, but he did not receive the beginning of being
God and being held as such from her, but in that he became man. he writes her as
his mother. But he did not pass from being God, although he took that which he
was not; but, as he remained that which he is, so also he became truly man. That
the body which he united to <A NAME="p189"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|189</SPAN></A> him
was not without a soul is certain from the words of the angel: for he said, «Rise,
take the boy and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for they are dead who
sought the boy's soul» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#512"><SUP>512</SUP></A>: concerning which he
also said, «I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#513"><SUP>513</SUP></A>.
But it was not without intelligence and imperfect, according to the statement of
the proverbs of Apollinaris, but was in fact intelligent, as indeed the very
term 'boy' and the fact that he was named 'man' is enough to show this same
thing: for a boy's soul is not without reason, but it is reasonable because it
is human. However this very same thing is also clearly shown even by the sacred
writings of the gospel; for it said of him, «Then he began to be distressed and
grieved, and to say, 'My soul is sorrowful, even unto death'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#514"><SUP>514</SUP></A>.
But it is plain to everyone that distress and grief happen to a rational and
intellectual soul. But, if they say that the Godhead of the Only one took the
place of intellect, this is in truth a thing without intellect, for us to assign
the passion of distress to the impassible nature of God. Accordingly the Only
God the Word became perfectly man, that he might:bestow upon us perfect
salvation: for, as soon as he was born, he did away <A NAME="p190"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|190</SPAN></A>
the punishment laid upon Eve, who was first led astray by the serpent. If
Emmanuel had not been born, who is the Word of God who took flesh, who according
to the saying of the prophet 'removed weeping from all faces' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#515"><SUP>515</SUP></A>,
the curse, «In pains shalt thou bear children» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#516"><SUP>516</SUP></A>,
would not have ceased: nevertheless it ceased because God was born. Further
witness is borne to this by the actual unerring words of the gospel also: for it
introduces to us the angel saying, «I announce unto you great joy, which
belongeth to all the world, that to-day there hath been born to us a Saviour,
who is the Lord Christ, in the city of David» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#517"><SUP>517</SUP></A>.
Mark clearly that, if it were not that hé who was born was the Lord, the joy
that came to all the world, which is also the joy of the whole race of men, the
curse, «In pains shalt thou bear children», would not have ceased. But, if the
birth is the cause of the joy, she who bore is also free from the punishment;
and thenceforth the joy necessarily passes to those who believe in him: for he
said, «Those who received him he gave them power to become sons of God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#518"><SUP>518</SUP></A>,
those who attained to the adoption through the Spirit, after he became man.</p>
<p>And next the third question, as to how we should, understand Paul's <A NAME="p191"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|191</SPAN></A>
saying, «In him all the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#519"><SUP>519</SUP></A>.
The defence.</p>
<p>In the same God-befitting frame of mind let us also understand (and that is
what in your third question you thought good to ask) the words which the wise
Paul wrote and sent to the Golossians about Christ, how that in him all the
fulness of the Godhead came to dwell bodily; for we do not understand the
expression 'in him dwelleth' as the supporters of the impiety of Nestorius wish
to understand it: for these say that the Word came to dwell in Christ by way of
indwelling, as in one of the prophets. But, lest any man in consequence of the
statement that he came to dwell decline from the proper opinion and reckon the
Incarnation of the Word a mere indwelling, as happened in the case of a man,
Paul is sufficient to meet this false tenet when he says that it came to dwell
in him 'bodily', that is hypostatically and naturally, even as the statement
that he similarly partook with us of flesh and blood <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#520"><SUP>520</SUP></A>
unconfusedly and immutably, in a Unity that is not dissipated, all mingling and
phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#521"><SUP>521</SUP></A> being far from it; for it is alien to
a bodiless nature that in consequence of its union with a body it should be
mingled or changed, a thing which in its nature does <A NAME="p192"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|192</SPAN></A>
not touch anything bodily. As to the fact that the word 'dwell' is also used of
those who are hypostatically united, we have the testimony of the wise Paul
himself; for in writing to the Corinthians he said, «We know that, even if this
our house, our tent on earth, is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house
not made with hands, that abideth for ever in heaven»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#522"><SUP>522</SUP></A>.
As we are said to dwell in a body as in a house, so too God the Word is said to
dwell in a body, as being hypostatically united to a body that has a rational
and intelligent soul. But he said that all the fulness of the Godhead dwells,
that is, not one operation, nor yet a partial grace of the Word himself, as took
place in the inspiration of the prophets, but the whole hypostasis of the Only
one, although he is raised above all limitation, he who imparts tens of
thousands of operations to others, and distributes graces by way of gifts as
from a fountain.</p>
<p>And again the fourth question, as to how it is that, if we say that the
Trinity is one nature, and also confess one incarnate nature of God the Word, we
do not also say that the Father and the Holy Spirit became incarnate with the
Son. The defence. <A NAME="p193"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|193</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have said that this also is impiously said by some men, that,
inasmuch as we believe that God the Word was united to flesh, the Father also,
inasmuch as he is named as being of the same nature, is necesarily said to have
become incarnate, and the Holy Spirit also, we fitly say what we can and what we
have believed, fixing our mind on the divine Scriptures, and not crying from the
earth according to the prophet's saying <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#523"><SUP>523</SUP></A>, nor
yet making up things that come from our heart <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#524"><SUP>524</SUP></A>.
But this objection has occurred to them in this way. If so be that Christ cries
in the gospel, «I am in my Father and my Father in me»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#525"><SUP>525</SUP></A>,
and Paul again says that the Son is the image of the invisible God <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#526"><SUP>526</SUP></A>,
and the Holy Spirit also the image of the Son, in that he said of those who had
been admitted to the adoption as sons by the Spirit, «they became conformed to
the image of his Son» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#527"><SUP>527</SUP></A>, that it might be shown
as following from this that the Holy Trinity is one essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#528"><SUP>528</SUP></A>,
when it is said that the Son became incarnate, how can we not also allow that
the Father and the Holy Spirit too became incarnate, inasmuch as they are in the
Son and appear in him? This is what these say. But we say with intelligence:
These, my good men, are the words of those who confuse the hypostases. But, if
the Father is the Father, he never passes <A NAME="p194"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|194</SPAN></A>
into the Son, and the Holy Spirit also remains fixedly and without
transformation in his own hypostasis, and does not pass into the hypostasis of
the Son: but the divine Scriptures have said that the Son became incarnate and
became man, and it is on account of the co-essentiality that, the Father and the
Holy Spirit are said to be in him, not in order that we may dissolve and
confound the hypostasis of the Father and of the Holy Spirit in the Son. But, if
the Son is the image of the Father, the very name 'image' shows that it is
understood to be the image of another hypostasis separate from itself: for, if
it is an image, it is an image of some one, and, because it is an unvarying
image in all points, it is not therefore the person himself of whom it is an
image; for, if it were the person himself, it would fail to . be an image, for
of whom would it be an image? Suppose a man delineates and copies a design and
pattern from an original tablet on to another, and draws it correctly in all
points, and makes the copy like the original, in no <A NAME="p195"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|195</SPAN></A>
point falling short of the pattern that was first designed, but makes the colour
and form <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#529"><SUP>529</SUP></A> and stature and size and pose of the
limbs also alike, and those who see it for the first time do not know, if one
may so say, which is the original from which it was drawn and designed, on
account of the exact resemblance of the appearance in both, and after this he
takes the copy and fixes it on a wall, then <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#530"><SUP>530</SUP></A>
will anyone of right understanding say that the original tablet has been fixed
on the wall, because it is a copy of it and contains all that belongs to the
original pattern? So we say that the Son became incarnate, the true image of the
Father, who has by nature everything that belongs to his begetter, and we do not
on this account hold that the Father became incarnate, who appears in his own
special hypostasis or person. <A NAME="p196"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|196</SPAN></A> What
has been said is intended as an indication of the subject, in order that the
understanding may receive a defective and obscure example, because the whole
force of the example does not follow in the footsteps of the truth, since here
the image is without soul and immoveable, and is limited by the appearance of
colours, but above there is a living and moveable image, suprasensual and
unlimited and without appearance <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#531"><SUP>531</SUP></A>, and
possessing immutability by nature. But, if we look into the divine Scriptures,
we may through the mystery that has been richly revealed in them by another
example also reçoive an illustration of what is stated. It is everywhere known
that our speech <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#532"><SUP>532</SUP></A> is the offspring of our mind,
and not the offspring only, but also the clear image, which represents the
disposition <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#533"><SUP>533</SUP></A> </sup>that is in the depths
of the mind, and with the speech comes forth also the <A NAME="p197"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|197</SPAN></A>
breath <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#534"><SUP>534</SUP></A> of the mouth. The example is defective,
and is a kind of similitude and shadow of the truth itself for those who are
able to listen properly and intelligently. However, as our speech comes out
through the organ <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#535"><SUP>535</SUP></A> of the voice and moves the
hearing and passes inside him who hears, and no one says that the speech which
is begotten by the mind, exists hypostatically, the speech which enters into the
hearing of him who hears, or says that the breath which comes out in the speech
through the voice exists in hypostasis <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#536"><SUP>536</SUP></A>, but
only calls it a help to the hearing, so understand also with regard to the
mystery of God the Word, because he himself alone hypostatically and ineffably
and as he himself only knows came to dwell in the Virgin's womb and became
incarnate from her, and neither the Father his begetter nor the Spirit which
proceeds shared in this, but according to the saying of John, «The Word became
flesh, and he was God, and was with God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#537"><SUP>537</SUP></A>, as
one with another, because the hypostases exist severally. Since then these
things are so, that question of theirs which arises from ignorance <A NAME="p198"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|198</SPAN></A>
is superfluous and vain, a question that amounts to actual impiety. «If» (they
say) «you say that the Trinity is one nature, and say that there is one nature
of the incarnate Word, how are you not driven to saying that the whole Trinity
became incarnate?» I am surprised at the cunning rusticity of those men, as
shown by the way in which they display courage without consideration against the
right opinion. We <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#538"><SUP>538</SUP></A> use the name 'nature'
sometimes generally of 'essence' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#539"><SUP>539</SUP></A>, and
sometimes specifically signifying the hypostasis of a man. We term all mankind
one nature, as in the text «Every nature of beasts and of birds and of things
that are in the water is subjected and made subject to human nature» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#540"><SUP>540</SUP></A>:
and again we call a man 'nature', Paul for instance or Peter or James. Where we
name all mankind one nature, we use the name 'nature' generically in place of
'essence': but, where we speak of one nature of Paul, we employ the name
'nature' in place of 'individual hypostasis'. So also, when we say that the Holy
Trinity is one nature, as in the text, «In order that we may be sharers of the
divine nature» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#541"><SUP>541</SUP></A>, we use the name 'nature' in
place of the general <A NAME="p199"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|199</SPAN></A> designation
'essence' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#542"><SUP>542</SUP></A>. And to say that the Holy Trinity is
one nature is the same as to say that it is one Godhead, as we are in fact
accustomed to call all mankind one nature. But, when we say 'one incarnate
nature of God the Word', we say 'nature' in place of an individual designation,
and thereby we denote the one actual hypostasis of the Word, like that of Paul
or Peter or any single man. Therefore also, when we say one nature which became
incarnate', we do not say so absolutely, but we say 'one nature of the Word
himself, and clearly denote that it is one hypostasis. But again let no one
stain the divine nature that is raised above all things with anything lowly
taken from the example of Paul and Peter. For, although they are of the same
essence, they differ not only in hypostases, but also in power and operation,
and stature and shape, and in the various kinds of impulses that are in men's
minds. The Holy Trinity however differs by the difference of hypostases only,
and in every point is unvarying in equality, and in the fact that it is of the
same essence. And avoid that poverty of the example which is not worthy of the
Godhead, and do not conceive of the Word as without hypostasis, nor yet of the
Spirit as being dissipated in the air <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#543"><SUP>543</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p200"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|200</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next the fifth question, as to how the Only one, who is a quickening
blessing, was termed a curse <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#544"><SUP>544</SUP></A>. The defence.</p>
<p>We will now go on to give you an answer with regard to the fifth question
also, how the Only one, who is a quickening blessing, was termed a curse. If he
became man to free our race from the bonds of former crimes, and took upon him
the seed of Abraham, and flesh of our nature, and united a human soul to himself
hypostatically, therefore he made all the debts of our race to which we were
liable his own: for we are accursed, and we came under, the penalty of the
curse, and heard the words, «Dust thou art and to dust shalt thou return»,
and, «Cursed is the earth in the work of thine hands», and, «In the sweat of
thy face shalt thou eat bread» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#545"><SUP>545</SUP></A>; and he became
the firstfruits of our nature. For in that he took upon him the seed of Abraham
he is consequently said to have become <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#546"><SUP>546</SUP></A> those
things to which our nature was subject. Nor yet was he subject to these things
for a moment of time, but rather after they had been vainly applied to him he
destroyed them. Just as the sun when it shines in a gloomy and dark house, as
soon as it puts forth its ray, dispels the darkness, since it itself is not
affected <A NAME="p201"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|201</SPAN></A> by darkness, in the same
way also the Only God the Word, the Sun of righteousness, as soon as he
approached our nature, also dispelled the curse. For the holy Virgin, who
conceived with the divine and incorruptible conception, immediately heard from
Elizabeth who had been divinely moved, that is the servant of the Baptist, the
words, «Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And
whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#547"><SUP>547</SUP></A>.
If she had not known that it was the Lord who was conceived of the God-bearer
Mary, she would not have cried, «Blessed is the fruit of thy womb». In
agreement with this our Lord himself also in his words dispelled the curse, that
the earth might no more be 'cursed in the work of thine hands', saying, «Work
not the food that perisheth, but the food that abideth in eternal life, which
the Son of man will give you», and not, «In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat thy bread», but, «I am the bread of life which came down from heaven, and
if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever», and no more, «Dust thou
art and to dust shalt thou return», but, «This is the will of my Father, that
everyone who seeth the Son and believeth on him shall have eternal life, and I
will raise him up at the last day» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#548"><SUP>548</SUP></A>. You see
that on all points by <A NAME="p202"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|202</SPAN></A> being
himself made a curse he becomes a dispeller of the curse, and this curse he
takes up on to the cross, and thence puts it to flight: for it was overcome by
the law which said, «Cursed of God is everyone who shall be hanged upon wood» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#549"><SUP>549</SUP></A>.
And he himself underwent the accursed death that was for our sake, and thence
blessed the whole human race; and the blessed Paul bears witness who writes to
the Galatians and says, «Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, and
became a curse for our sake, because it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is
hanged upon wood', in order that the blessing of Abraham might be among the
nations in Jesus Christ» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#550"><SUP>550</SUP></A>. So also he is said
to have become sin <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#551"><SUP>551</SUP></A>, because he endured the
death that was the due of sinners; for, while he is himself the pure justice of
the Father, he is crucified between two robbers; but these on account of their
offences, and in accordance with the passage in the Gospel of Mark who says, «And
with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left,
and the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, 'He was numbered with the unjust'»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#552"><SUP>552</SUP></A>. So he became sin to remit the sins of others:
so also he paid the debt that was incurred for us, and we ourselves became
righteousness in him; for those who have been freed from debts are righteous,
and <A NAME="p203"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|203</SPAN></A> are not termed liable. And,
because during the time of his Humanization he did no sin, therefore also
iniquity was not found in him, but he showed himself righteous, that is, he is
righteousness; and, when he became flesh, all our nature again was justified in
him as in firstfruits; and this is what the wise Paul said to the Corinthians
about the Father, «He made him sin for our sake, who knew no sin, that we might
be the righteousness of God in him» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#553"><SUP>553</SUP></A>. This too
was carried out in the ritual of the law also; for the two goats on whom lots
were laid were a type of Christ our Saviour, who is made up of two elements, the
perfect Godhead I mean and the manhood: and the one, on whom the Lord's lot
fell, was slaughtered, while the other was dismissed into the wilderness that is
not passed,, who also was named 'the dismissible', who gained the appellation
also from the fact itself; for he was dismissed, but was hot simply dismissed,
but in the manner which Scripture mentioned; for it said as follows: «And thou
shalt bring the living goat, and Aaron shall lay his two hands on the head of
the living goat, and shall confess over him all the sin of the sons of Israel,
and all their wickedness and their iniquity, and shall lay them on the head of
the living goat, and shall dismiss him by means of a man who is ready into the
wilderness; <A NAME="p204"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|204</SPAN></A> and the goat shall
take upon him all their iniquity» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#554"><SUP>554</SUP></A>. This
therefore was thus performed in the case of the two goats also, that the one was
slaughtered and the other dismissed. We clearly see the hidden meaning which
relates to the Cross: for the type denotes that the same one Christ suffered in
the flesh, but remained without suffering in that he is considered to he true
God. For the same person both is separated by lots to the Lord and slaughtered
(for 'he delivered himself for our sake as an offering and a sacrifice to God
the Father for a sweet savour' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#555"><SUP>555</SUP></A>), and goes away
without suffering bearing the sins of all Israel, which in the type of Aaron
were confessed over the head of the goat: for he clearly displays himself as
being himself true God, over whom we confess our sins according to law; for «I
will make confession», he saith, «unto thee, Lord, concerning my sins, and
thou wilt forgive the wickedness of my heart» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#556"><SUP>556</SUP></A>;
for, though 'he was led as a lamb to the slaughter', yet, 'who shall tell his
generation, because his life is taken away from the earth?' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#557"><SUP>557</SUP></A>,
for he is without descent as God, and he is life in his nature, for he was taken
away and lifted up from the earth. Truly is it said of him in reference to the
type that he shall be dismissed into the wilderness that is not passed; for that
country is impassable to all outside <A NAME="p205"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|205</SPAN></A>
nature, and is passable to him who became incarnate only, I mean the throne of
the kingdom, on which he sits at the Father's right hand, bearing our sins; for
so too John also the loud-voiced preacher and ambassador of the Word himself
cried and said, «Behold! the Lamb of God who beareth the sin of the world» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#558"><SUP>558</SUP></A>.
For the same person is termed at one time a goat, at another a lamb; and he
shows that he came to suffer not only for the sake of sinners, but also for the
sake of the righteous; for death reigned 'even over those who had not sinned'
also, as Paul also said <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#559"><SUP>559</SUP></A>. Accordingly the lamb
is the type of the righteous, and the goat of sinners; for the righteous stand
as lambs on the right hand, and the sinners as goats on the left. Let no one
think- that through the symbol of the two goats he shows us two Christs, one
passible and the other impassible, but one and the same, passible in the flesh,
but impassible in his Godhead. For indeed one goat only was not sufficient to
signify what was signified with two (how was it possible for the same to be
slaughtered and not slaughtered?), to show that Christ tasted death in the
flesh, and in his Godhead is raised above suffering. Is it not plain therefore
that another goat is necessarily taken, in order that the one fact may be
perfectly revealed symbolically in <A NAME="p206"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|206</SPAN></A>
the two? Just as a painter, when he depicts the story of Abraham, depicts him
several times, now hearing God saying to him, «Offer thy son to me as a
burnt-sacrifice», now cutting faggots, now again binding Isaac and laying him
on the faggots, now with his hand armed with the knife and stretched out to slay
and held back by the heavenly voice coming from above, and we do not think the
one Abraham to be many because the same person was depicted many times, and
indeed one picture was not sufficient to tell the whole story, so also for the
shadowy representation of the symbol, for the sake of perfectly setting forth
the fact, two goats were taken, and we do not divide the one Christ into two,
but we declare him to be one out of two natures, the perfect Godhead and the
manhood, according to the faith of the divine Scriptures, and the words of the
fathers that are inspired by the Spirit, from which sources we also speak these
things. That the two goats symbolized the one Christ is plain from the allegory
of the lots; for the priest Aaron did not select one of the goats at haphazard
to be slaughtered, but committed the matter to the uncertainty of lots, that by
this he might show the primary unity of God the Word and his flesh. As he is
himself God <A NAME="p207"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|207</SPAN></A> impassible and free,
but by reason of the union with a body possessing a rational soul was condemned
to death, though in his nature he is immortal, so also the one goat who was to
be dismissed to the wilderness symbolized the impassibility of the Godhead of
the Only one, and was under the decree of slaughter; for the lot cast over him,
whether he was to be slaughtered or dismissed, was uncertain. Accordingly it is
plain that the two goats signify the one Christ, and that the same suffered in
the flesh, and, in that he is God, remained raised above sufferings. Nor yet let
anyone, imitating the madness of the heathen, imagine that the dismissed goat
was set apart and dismissed to the wilderness for some demon; for this is a
departure from the laws of Moses, inasmuch as he said, «Hear, Israel. The Lord
thy God is one Lord», and again, «Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou draw near, and in his name shalt
thou swear», and, «Thou shalt not go after other gods» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#560"><SUP>560</SUP></A>;
and again in another place, «And ye shall not make mention of the name of other
gods, and it shall not be heard from your mouth»; and again, «Thou shalt not
worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds, but shalt
utterly overturn them and destroy their pillars, and shalt serve the Lord <A NAME="p208"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|208</SPAN></A>
thy God only» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#561"><SUP>561</SUP></A>. How then should he in the same
mind break in pieces and overturn their pillars (and he did not allow the name
of other gods to be mentioned at all beside the one Lord God), and on the other
hand separate the goat to another beside him as to some evil fiend, and
propitiate this fiend in this way? But it is plain that the two goats were
offered in order to honour one God only, and completed the symbolic allegory
which we have already mentioned, and two lots were cast, and one was slaughtered
to the Lord, and the other was dismissed after the manner of the separation of
the lots, and therefore he was called 'the dismissible'. If he had said, «One
goat to the Lord, and one goat to the dismissible», perhaps their charge would
have derived some plausibility from the divine Scripture, because it said, «One
lot to the Lord, and one to the dismissible»; for it is plain that the one was
separated for the purpose of slaughter, and the other was dismissed to the Lord,
not to another different from him; for this is what the divine Scripture said,
«And he shall set' the living one before the Lord, in order to dismiss him in
dismissal» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#562"><SUP>562</SUP></A>. But some of the learned Hebrews,
that is rather those who are earlier than those who are of the Hebrews, said <A NAME="p209"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|209</SPAN></A>
«One lot to the Lord, and one lot to him that was dismissed» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#563"><SUP>563</SUP></A>,
in order that in all points and that even from the very imagination of the
heathen, or, to speak fittingly, from their lack of instruction, it might be
seen that their charge against the holy laws of Moses is without plausibility.
For those who after the Christian religion were lifted up in philosophy, and
endeavoured to adorn demon-worship in a reverend fashion <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#564"><SUP>564</SUP></A>,
as they themselves say on behalf of others, say of their god who is called
'mb1khywn, «We should not sacrifice to the gods, but by purity of mind
propitiate and honour them» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#563"><SUP>563</SUP></A>: but men who were
fettered in the same chain as they said that men should sedulously offer
sacrifices to the evil spirits who delight in blood, not that they may help, but
that they may not injure <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#565"><SUP>565</SUP></A>. If then Moses
separated and dismissed one of the goats to a demon, according to the madness of
those men he ought to have ordered this goat to be slaughtered to the demon, and
he who is pleased by blood ought to have rejoiced in his blood. But now the
exact contrary is the case: the one who was set apart to God Most High was
slaughtered, while the other, the dismissible, or, as they wish to say. the one
who was separated to an evil <A NAME="p210"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|210</SPAN></A>
demon, was dismissed into the wilderness without blood and without sacrifice. By
all these arguments the ingenious madness of the heathen has been refuted, who
wished to stain the divine Scripture with the blame of their cults of many
demons, men who did not shrink from calling the usual sacrifices to their idols
'dismissible', in order to substantiate their error by a plausible identity of
name. These things we have stated shortly in the desire to show how Jesus became
sin for us, that we might in him become the righteousness of God. He endured a
death that was for our sake, he who for the sins of us all became one that is
subject, he who knows not sin, for according to the prophet's saying, «He came
to death for the sins of my people, and for our sake he suffered pain, and was
smitten, and he endured sickness for our iniquity» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#566"><SUP>566</SUP></A><i>.
</i>So also Paul wrote to the Hebrews and said, &quot;Christ was offered once,
that he might bear the sins of many» , and he says that 'by his sacrifice he
hath been revealed once for all at the last for the doing away of sin', and 'he
offered one eternal offering for our sins' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#567"><SUP>567</SUP></A>:
and Peter the eminent among the apostles said, «The same carried up our sins in
his body on to the cross, that we, being freed from sins, might live in
righteousness»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#568"><SUP>568</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>And again the sixth question, as to how we say that the same suffered in <A NAME="p211"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|211</SPAN></A>
the flesh, and in his Godhead remained without suffering, and, while we do not
make him alien to suffering, we keep him without suffering. The defence. Now we
will give a sufficient answer to that question also, how we say that the same
suffered in the flesh, and did not suffer in the Godhead, and, while we do not
make him alien to suffering, we keep him without suffering. On the same subject
we will lay before you an example which has come to us from our fathers. The
force of examples is in truth small, and far removed from the truth;
nevertheless, if only in some thin and shadowy phantasies <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#569"><SUP>569</SUP></A>,
it offers to the understanding a beginning of conceptions. As, when iron or
another similar substance <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#570"><SUP>570</SUP></A> is abundantly warmed
by fire, and is heated by flame, we know that, while the iron does not pass out
of its own nature, the iron which has passed into a complete flame, and has been
made to hiss and to glow by it, it appears to be all fire, and, while it is in
this state, blows are applied to it, it being smitten by a hammer or by means of
other kinds of strokes, but the iron is exposed to the blows themselves, being
expanded and narrowed at the same time, while the nature of the fire is in no
way injured by the smiter, so must we also understand the mystery <A NAME="p212"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|212</SPAN></A>
concerning Christ also, even although all the power of speech shrinks, from the
glory of the fact. He was hypostatically united to a body with a rational and
intelligent soul, but he permitted it to suffer naturally from the blows of
pains, I mean on the cross, when he might have deadened these also as God, but
he was not desirous of this, for it was not for himself, but for our race, that
he was purchasing the successes of victory. Therefore he permitted his body to
suffer, while even he himself also was not alien from suffering, for he was
united to a suffering body, and, as it is his body, so also it is called his
suffering; nevertheless as God he remained without suffering, for God is not
touched by suffering. He is said also to have tasted death for us, in that his
soul was separated from his body; not that his soul was cut away from his
Godhead, or his body left without Godhead; but he showed that he was in both
without separation, for neither was his soul left in Sheol, nor did his flesh
see corruption <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#571"><SUP>571</SUP></A>, according to the saying of the
Psalmist. For he was not separated from his body that was buried, and therefore
he annihilated corruption; for, if it had been separated from him who is life
and incorruption, perhaps it would have been constantly <A NAME="p213"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|213</SPAN></A>
attacked by corruption also. For he went down into Sheol with his soul also, the
whole of him being in it, and the whole of him in his body without separation,
as one that is incorporeal and is able to fill everything as one that is
infinite. It was necessary for him to give light even to the lower regions also,
and to have mercy on the souls there imprisoned, and, according to the saying of
the prophet, «to say to those that are in bonds, 'Come forth', and to those
also that are in darkness, 'Be revealed'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#572"><SUP>572</SUP></A>.
This he accomplished in action. The gates of Sheol which saw him trembled, and
he broke the bars of iron and gates of bronze <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#573"><SUP>573</SUP></A>,
and opened Paradise which was shut, and «many bodies of just men among those
who had fallen asleep came out of their graves after his resurrection, and went
into the holy city, and appeared to many» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#574"><SUP>574</SUP></A>.
Very properly the evangelist added, 'after his resurrection'; for it was
necessary that he who is life in his nature should himself first begin the
resurrection, and that the very one who was able to dissolve the power of death
should himself tread the way for the rest who came after him. He did not deal
arbitrarily with the devil, the same who led the first man astray, when he was
defeated as by God, but, as one who is just and 'taketh the wise in their
craftiness' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#575"><SUP>575</SUP></A>, he brought the <A NAME="p214"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|214</SPAN></A>
crafty one into subjection by means of his devices. He who led Adam astray and
said to him, «You will be a god, if you transgress the law», fell by the
device of craft. He fought with the second Adam who is Christ, and found him to
be God and man at the same time; and he won a just victory over him; and
henceforth we confidently sing songs of praise for his victory over death and
say, «Where is thy victory, death? and where is thy sting, Sheol?» For Paul
says that 'the sting of death is sin' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#576"><SUP>576</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>Next the seventh question, why the law was given to the fathers that they
should circumcise their foreskin. The defence.</p>
<p>Now we pass on to discuss the subject of circumcision. This <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#577"><SUP>577</SUP></A>
is what you ask, &quot;Why was the law given to the fathers that they should
circumcise their foreskin?» Some have simply and easily handed down a reason
like this. They say, «Because Abraham migrated from the land of the Chaldees,
and the Chaldees were permitted (and the same was the case too with the Medes
and Persians also) according to the custom of their fathers to have intercourse
with their mothers and sisters, for this reason therefore he circumcised his
foreskin, that he might shun kindred flesh, <A NAME="p215"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|215</SPAN></A>
and renounce marriage with those of his kin, and on this account God gave the
law to the sons of Israel through Moses and said, 'A man shall not go in to any
that is related to him in the flesh to uncover his shame' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#578"><SUP>578</SUP></A>».
And others say that the reason why Abraham was commanded to circumcise his
progeny also besides was that it might be plain that Christ should come of them
in the flesh who is God over all for ever and ever. But, if you please, we will
pass from these reasons; for it is known that the Egyptians also as well and
other nations circumcise their foreskin, even although they imitated the
Hebrews; and we state that which is true and befits God the lawgiver, and that
is very sublime and to which testimony is borne by the Scriptures, that
circumcision promises renunciation of fleshly birth, and acquisition of the
adoption of the Spirit, by which we are called sons of God; for it is written,
«Thus saith the Lord, 'Israel is my son, my firstborn'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#579"><SUP>579</SUP></A>.
After the fall from Paradise and the' destruction of immortality, Adam knew Eve,
and she conceived and bare; and this unstable intercourse, intercourse befitting
beasts, was given for the propagation of our race, it being a kind of healing of
the sickness, that the race of men might <A NAME="p216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A>
not be cut off through death. The woman was not at first given to Adam for the
sake of the procreation of children, but that she might be a helper to him; for
the Lord God said, «It is not good for Adam to be alone; let us make him a
helper like to him» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#580"><SUP>580</SUP></A><i>. </i>He did not say
from the beginning that he would make her be fruitful and multiply, in order
that by means of fertility the race might go on to multiplication; for God might
have done this even without the intercourse of marriage, and have made our race
increase and multiply like the myriads of angels, as the Lord himself actually
said in a place in the gospel, «In the resurrection there is no marriage, nor
yet are they joined in marriage, but they will be as the angels in heaven» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#581"><SUP>581</SUP></A>.
If anyone says, «What is the help that the woman was to give the man?», we
easily say: In the worship in Paradise and in the keeping of the law; as Solomon
also said of a similar woman, «Who can find a manly woman?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#582"><SUP>582</SUP></A>,
and again another wise man says, «A manly woman gladdeneth her husband», and,
«A good woman is a good portion <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#583"><SUP>583</SUP></A>»: and for
this reason they also received the law in common, that through union and
conjunction of breath <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#584"><SUP>584</SUP></A> they might be cautious,
and not liable to be overcome by the <A NAME="p217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A>
deceit of the serpent; for he said to them, «Of the tree of knowledge of good
and evil ye shall not eat of it; but in the day in which ye shall eat of it ye
shall die» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#585"><SUP>585</SUP></A>. For, as long as they kept the
law, and rejoiced with one another without passion, and did not perceive one
another's nakedness, and also did not think of their union in marriage, they
enjoyed the blessed life in Paradise itself. But, when the woman gave up the
duty of help, and like a weak person out of simplicity accepted the deceitful
counsel of the serpent, then she herself also became an evil counsellor to the
man, and immediately they were alien to God, and also to the life in Paradise,
and by means of death were condemned; and Adam knew his wife, and she becomes a
helper to him in the second line, through the procreation of children <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#586"><SUP>586</SUP></A>.
And at first she was given him as a helper in the worship in Paradise; for such
is God's care for us that, even when we change, he continues to help us: for he
made man his own master, and to honour that which is good; and, having foreseen
that he would change, he provided a helper for him beforehand. Therefore also
Adam by the grace of God, as soon as the woman was created, foretold that a man
should 'leave his father and his <A NAME="p218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A>
mother, and cleave to his wife, and they two should be one flesh' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#587"><SUP>587</SUP></A>.
This bodily birth circumcision renounces, which was given after the fall from
the life in Paradise in the character of a remedy, and causes us to approach to
the impassibility which existed during the residence in Paradise; by which we
are named sons of God, inasmuch as it slays our members upon the earth, and puts
off from us the old man. The truth itself, of which circumcision is a type,
testifies to us; for Paul wrote to the Colossians and said that circumcision in
Christ is baptism, whereby we put away from us our old man, and the mortality
wherein we died after our fall from Paradise, and we also cut away the bodily
desire as it were a kind of foreskin, and bury it in the waters which slay sin,
and in the same way we are buried with Christ, and rise as new men and born
afresh, and hasten to the new and; passionless life; for this is what Paul
wrote: «In whom ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, by
stripping off the body of your flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, and were
buried with him in baptism, and rose in him through faith in the operation of
God who raised him from the place of the dead; and you also, who had died in
your sins and in the foreskin of your flesh, he quickened <A NAME="p219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A>
with him, and he forgave you all your sins» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#588"><SUP>588</SUP></A>.
You see that circumcision is the destruction of the foreskin, and contains a
renunciation of fleshly birth and of the body's pleasure in mortality; for it
confesses the passionless and new-fashioned life, as the actual truth of baptism
showed, of which circumcision is a type, which in a shadow cuts away the
foreskin of the flesh, while baptism cuts away the foreskin of the soul, and, so
to speak, destroys its excessive wickedness. Such was the legal ceremony, and
the covenant with Abraham, and of <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#589"><SUP>589</SUP></A> his
descendants, which by the ancients was carried out in a bodily and sensual
fashion, but signified beforehand the allegorical conceptions, which the
spiritual and suprasensual ceremony in Christ revealed and brought to pass, for
through baptism we are circumcised with a suprasensual circumcision, and receive
in our mind the privilege of being no longer sons of the flesh, for we are named
sons of God. Hear what John the thunder and trumpet of the divine words says, «For
those who received him he gave them power to become sons of God, those who
believed on his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of
God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#590"><SUP>590</SUP></A>. Joshua <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#591"><SUP>591</SUP></A>
also the son of Nun, who typified Jesus who is God and our Saviour, shows this
clearly, that circumcision is the baptism which is <A NAME="p220"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|220</SPAN></A>
perfected in Christ, and was given to the sons of Israel as to a kind of sons
without passibility; but, because they had lived forty years in the wilderness,
it happened that the sons who were begotten by them remained uncircumcised,
though it was possible for them to circumcise. But this did not happen by
chance, but because God was directing this matter in order to reveal the future
mystery; and neither did Moses circumcise them, the exact observer of the
fathers' customs, who ordered that anyone who collected sticks on the
sabbath-day should die <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#592"><SUP>592</SUP></A>, who knew all things
beforehand, and among them the threat pronounced by God who said, «Whoever is
not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall
perish from among its people, because it hath set at naught my covenant» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#593"><SUP>593</SUP></A>;
nor yet did Joshua <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#594"><SUP>594</SUP></A> again, who succeeded to the
government after Moses, circumcise them before they crossed Jordan; but, after
they had crossed Jordan, then he took knives of rock and cut away their
foreskins from them. And this is plain, that he who has crossed Jordan and by
the laver is admitted to regeneration is circumcised with a rock-knife, which is
Christ: for «the <A NAME="p221"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|221</SPAN></A> Word of God is
living, and effectual and sharp beyond a two-edged knife»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#595"><SUP>595</SUP></A>;
and according to Paul's saying Christ also is a rock <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#596"><SUP>596</SUP></A>.
Let no one hold the unreasonable supposition that they had no iron-knives in the
wilderness; for they were armed, and slew those who opposed them. Mark again the
same type in other mysteries also; for the blessed Paul said, «Those who were
baptized in Christ were baptized in his death» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#597"><SUP>597</SUP></A>,
and. Joshua <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#598"><SUP>598</SUP></A> the son of Nun presents the same
figure, for he provided that the knives with which he circumcised the sons 0f
Israel should be buried with him, that thereby he might show that those who are
baptized in the name of Jesus the true God with the baptism that is completed in
his death are by it circumcised. And, when we examine the sense of Scripture, we
find an unlimited abundance of thoughts, and a primary union and agreement of
the types with the truth, and praise the one God, the giver of the two covenants
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#599"><SUP>599</SUP></A>. And, as to the manner again in which we on
being admitted to the divine laver and regeneration and putting off from us our
old man are both invited by Christ to the mystic table and eat the angelic
heavenly bread, Joshua the son of Nun himself again showed us this mystery. For,
<A NAME="p222"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|222</SPAN></A> after they had crossed the Jordan
and been circumcised with knives of rock, then for the first time those who were
circumcised ate of the wheat of the land of promise, and celebrated the
Passover, not with the old leaven, but with the pure true leavens: and, as, when
Jesus Christ ate the legal Passover with his disciples, and thereby fulfilled
the law, and took the bread of thanksgiving in the midst, and blessed <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#600"><SUP>600</SUP></A>
the cup, and put an end to the legal Passover, the new <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#601"><SUP>601</SUP></A>
suprasensual sacrifice received a beginning and entrance, so also, when Joshua <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#602"><SUP>602</SUP></A>
the son of Nun as in a kind of prefigurement and type kneaded <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#603"><SUP>603</SUP></A>
unleavened loaves out of new wheat and kept the Passover, the old eating of
manna ceased, and on that same day came to an end. Thus in every single point
the type set forth the truth, It is proper also for us to hear the actual words
of divine Scripture: <A NAME="p223"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|223</SPAN></A> «And the
sons of Israel celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day from the evening,
to the west of Jericho, beyond Jordan in the plain. And they ate of the produce
of the land, and the next day they ate of the unleavened loaves of the Passover.
And that same day the manna was taken away, after they had eaten of the wheat
and the fruits of the land, and the sons of Israel had no longer manna» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#604"><SUP>604</SUP></A>.
The fact again that he who was bom was circumcised on the eighth day shows
clearly that that circumcision is a type of the life of impassibility in which
we truly live, not the life that is spent by those who are bom to destruction;
«for in the resurrection there is no marriage, nor yet persons given in
marriage, but they are as the angels in heaven» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#605"><SUP>605</SUP></A>:
for the eighth day itself is the beginning also on which our Lord rose, when he
became firstfruits for our resurrection. He who is circumcised on the eighth
day, which is the beginning of the future world <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#606"><SUP>606</SUP></A>,
is raised above this world, for the rest of which the seventh day was appointed,
the end of which brings us to that day which is the beginning and the eighth, on
which is the impassible life, and he does not know the words, «Be fruitful and
multiply» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#607"><SUP>607</SUP></A>. These, we think, are the <A NAME="p224"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|224</SPAN></A>
things which through circumcision were given to the sons of Israel. But you
perhaps, conversant as you are in divine things, can think of something else
that is greater and more sublime.</p>
<p>And next the eighth question, how we ought to understand the saying of our
Saviour in the gospel, «Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in
the way with him» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#608"><SUP>608</SUP></A>. The defence.</p>
<p>It agrees with the order of your questions that we should also shortly refer
to your other question about the words spoken by our Saviour in the gospel by
way of persuasion and advice, «Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou
art in the way with him, lest thine adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the
judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison, and thou shalt
not come out thence till thou pay the last mite» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#609"><SUP>609</SUP></A>.
This commandment is almost the same which says, «He that will sue thee and take
away thy tunic, let him have thy coat also» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#610"><SUP>610</SUP></A>.
However this needs a great effort in order that we may restrain and cut away the
corruptions of sin. For what he said is like this. «If you are standing in the <A NAME="p225"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|225</SPAN></A>
court that is trying the case itself, and are prosecuting before the judge, and
are altogether wrapt up in the court, rouse yourself on the way, and change from
enmity towards your adversary to agreement, considering the uncertainty of the
issue, lest you have to submit to an adverse verdict, and the adversary on the
contrary part deliver you to the judge as one that is guilty, and you fall some
time under sentence, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and so you be
chastised until you pay the last mite» (it is the custom to term the bronze
coin that is the smallest a mite). Luke also clearly confirms this sense, and
for perfect understanding it seems to me sufficient to cite his actual words: «But
why dost thou not of thyself judge righteously? But, when thou art going with
thine adversary on the way to the judge, make it thy business to be quit of him,
lest he deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the exactor,
and the exactor cast thee into prison. And verily, verily I say unto thee that
thou shalt not come out thence till thou pay the last mite» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#611"><SUP>611</SUP></A><i>.
</i>To strip off your cloak also for the man who has a suit with you about your
tunic and with great power overcome the rapacity of him who is contending with
you is an act of sublime and exalted wisdom. Think only of getting rid of the
running to, the judge <A NAME="p226"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|226</SPAN></A> and duly
preventing it during the time that is pressing upon you, when <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#612"><SUP>612</SUP></A>
you are not master of yourself, either to ruin your enemy or to reconcile him;
and this needs the labour and toil of philosophy. For he commands us not only
not to become adversaries, but to agree with our adversaries, and by
watchfulness to keep guard over and restrain wrath, and quickly assuage the fire
of enmity, and reconcile our present enemies by agreement. This is the simple
conclusion of this in the form of exposition; for some have taken this saying in
a higher sense. They say that a man's adversary is the reminder that comes from
his conscience, and our Lord says this: «When you sin or wish to sin <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#613"><SUP>613</SUP></A>,
agree with your adversary»<i>;</i> that is, accept the admonition that comes
from your conscience, when it reminds you and blames you, if you have sinned or
wished to sin; and, if you neglect the reminder from your conscience, and do not
obey nor restrain yourself <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#614"><SUP>614</SUP></A>, you do not agree <A NAME="p227"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|227</SPAN></A>
with your adversary, but rather use force against your adversary. So also is it
written in the prophet Hosea: «Ephraim used force against his adversary and
forgot judgment, because he began to go after vanity» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#615"><SUP>615</SUP></A>.
So also Paul wrote to the Romans and said: «Our conscience beareth witness, or
maketh defence, on the day on which God shall judge the secrets of men» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#616"><SUP>616</SUP></A>.
The words, 'as long as thou art in the way with him', have this meanmg, 'as far
as this world extends', and the way is trodden by all men: and this is what he
said: «While you are walking in this world as on a way, <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#617"><SUP>617</SUP></A>
accept the reminder that comes from your conscience and do not refuse it. If you
refuse it and pass out of this world without having agreed <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#617"><SUP>617</SUP></A>,
the conscience will take the place of an adversary and accuse you before the
judge and place you under his sentence, and the judge will deliver you to the
torture <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#618"><SUP>618</SUP></A>; <A NAME="p228"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|228</SPAN></A>
and these things would not have befallen you if you had made union with your
adversary in this way of the world, when admonition was offered to you, and you
did not accept this in agreement. This John the Evangelist also wrote in an
epistle and said: «If our conscience condemneth us not, we have confidence
towards God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#619"><SUP>619</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>And next the ninth question, as to how we ought to understand the words used
by Paul in the first epistle to the Corinthians, «Every sin that a man may sin
is outside his body; but he who committeth fornication sinneth against his body»&nbsp;
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#620"><SUP>620</SUP></A>. The defence.</p>
<p>Since you wished to have that other saying of the wise Paul also explained to
you which is made in the first epistle to the Corinthians, «Every sin that a
man may sin is outside his body, for he who committeth fornication sinneth
against his own body», examine the explanatory and easy exposition of our holy
fathers, who take this as a decree. Some say that Paul's <A NAME="p229"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|229</SPAN></A>
intention was this, to show the offence of fornication to be something greater
than all other sins, and therefore he frightens those that are weak in order
that they may rise to reformation, and by way of deterrent says that fornication
is a sin of the body, and as if the other sins are outside the body, and, though
a murderer defiles his hand with blood, and sins against his own body, and a
slanderer immerses his tongue in calumny as in blood, yet he who commits
fornication, he says, dips his whole body in the mire of sin, and lets it down
as into a pot that is fall of putrid matter; therefore too he who commits
fornication also, in that he thinks that the whole of him has been defiled and
polluted, runs to the laver in order to wash off the stain itself of the
pollution, which a slanderer or a robber or a thief never does, for they do not
think that their body is polluted and defiled by the sin: for Paul, wishing to
show that the offence of fornication is higher than the other sins, used this
expression and said, «The other sins are outside the body; for he who commits
fornication sins against his body». But certain others say that this is the
meaning of the saying that he who commits fornication sins against his own body,
that is, that he offends against the structure of the body, and, so to speak,
against the very formation of man, <A NAME="p230"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|230</SPAN></A>
and the very mystery of the beginning of birth (for it is indeed an ineffable
and all-glorious mystery and is known to God alone, how from the emission of a
small seed this great and rational animal, that is to say man, takes a
beginning); and this, they say, is the meaning of the words 'sins against his
body': «and abstain, I pray you, so to speak, from doing despite to the
formation of nature, from which your body too also sprang, by unlawful
intercourse; for you forget that you are acting madly against yourself, for this
act is in truth one of madness and drunkenness».</p>
<p>This is what these say. But others say better, as I also judge their
interpretation to be the highest, that is the nearest to the apostle's meaning.
Paul desired, so to speak, to show that the sin of fornication is beyond
forgiveness; and above this he says, «Know ye not that your bodies are members
of Christ?», and he turns reprovingly and says, «Shall I <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#621"><SUP>621</SUP></A>
then take a member of Christ and make it a member of a harlot <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#622"><SUP>622</SUP></A>?»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#623"><SUP>623</SUP></A>: and by this he <A NAME="p231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A>
showed that he who commits fornication offends against the members of Christ;
and so he goes on to say, «Every sin that a man may sin is outside the hody,
but he who commits fornication sins against his own body». A slanderer or a
thief or a robber or a covetous man sins against a man by slandering him or by
stealing his property or by desiring his goods; but he who commits fornication
sins against his own body, that is against a member of Christ. Every sin
distresses God, and men are reckoned to have sinned against him. These however
are human sins, and have been committed as it were against men. But blasphemy or
idolatry, and contempt and neglect of the sacred service, and things like these,
are, we say, acts of impiety against God, and they are believed, so to speak, to
be without <A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A> forgiveness, as also
Eli the priest and old in days who was negligent concerning his sons, who were
evil men as it is written and unlawfully offended against the divine service;
for <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#624"><SUP>624</SUP></A> he testified to them and said, «If a man
sin against a man, they shall pray to the Lord for him: but, if he sin against
the Lord, to whom shall they pray for him?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#625"><SUP>625</SUP></A>
So therefore Paul also wishes to make it appear that the sin of fornication is
committed against Christ himself: and just as, if a man take a harlot and bring
her into the holy temple of the Saviour of all, and there commit fornication, he
will not merely be called to account for fornication, but also judged for
impiety as having polluted the illustrious and holy place, so also he who
commits fornication before believing: in Christ and writing him as his leader
commits fornication <A NAME="p233"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|233</SPAN></A> only; but,
when he has through adoption been inserted in Christ's body, he is not only
charged on account of fornication, but is also accused of impiety, as doing
despite to the members of Christ <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#626"><SUP>626</SUP></A>. Therefore it
is with this meaning that Paul says, «He who commits fornication sins against
his own body». Immediately without any intervening words he went on to say, «Know
ye not that your body is the temple of the Spirit that is in you, which ye have
from God? And ye are not your own, for ye were bought with a price. Praise God
therefore in your body» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#627"><SUP>627</SUP></A>. Accordingly it is
plain that through the adoption of the Spirit, which is the Spirit of Christ, we
both become a temple of God, and, as it is said, «Christ dwelleth in our hearts»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#628"><SUP>628</SUP></A>; and let no one say that he who slanders and
he who robs pollutes the one the tongue, the other the hand only; for the
pollution is not the same, nor are the stain and the mire the same; and, even if
we allow it to be the same, yet the pollution does not affect the whole body
equally, nor is the whole temple of God so to speak defiled. For he who commits
fornication with a woman who commits fornication intertwines his whole body. <A NAME="p234"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|234</SPAN></A>
This objection the blessed Paul demolished beforehand by having recourse to the
divine Scriptures and saying, «They two shall be one flesh» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#629"><SUP>629</SUP></A>.
That the sin and pollution of the other sins and those of fornication are not
the same, but that the sin that arises from fornication is far removed from
these, because it renders the man who commits fornication with his body, or with
the temple of God, suddenly void of divine grace, this is clearly signified by
the story of Samson. He even before his conception received a commandment by the
voice of an angel, his mother being barren and his father Manoah <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#630"><SUP>630</SUP></A>;
and, when he had been conceived and grown up, his affairs were determined
according to the commandment of the angel who appeared; for he said, «Thou
shall observe and not drink either wine or strong drink, and thou shalt not eat
aught that is defiled; for lo! thou shalt conceive and shalt bear a son, and
iron shall not go up upon his head, because the boy is a Nazirite unto God from
thy womb» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#631"><SUP>631</SUP></A>. And he grew up and became very
great, and he was blessed by the Lord, and the Spirit of God was upon the boy,
through whom he wrought marvellous and glorious deeds. But, <A NAME="p235"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|235</SPAN></A>
when he began to transgress the law of the Lord, the other sins were worthy of
forgiveness, and the grace of the Spirit did not yet depart from him; but the
sin of fornication rendered him bereft of the grace of the Spirit. First he
transgressed against the law which commands the sons of Israel that it is not
right to take in marriage women alien to their tribes, who <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#632"><SUP>632</SUP></A>
were the peoples round them whose land they inherited. For Samson said, «I have
seen a beautiful woman in Timnath, of the daughters of the Philistines: now,
take her for me to wife». And his father said to him, «Is there not a woman in
the house of thy brethren of thy people to take, that thou goest to the
uncircumcised Philistines to take thee a wife?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#633"><SUP>633</SUP></A>:
however, they did not persuade him, but on the contrary even went with him to
make the unlawful betrothal. And God suffered this wickedness to be carried out,
in order that he might requite the Philistines, even against the wish of the
sons of Israel; for Samson's going down became an occasion for their
destruction. But, as they were going along and were bent on making the
betrothal, he turned a little out of the way, and he came upon a lion and killed
him as a man might kill a little kid. And the divine Scripture states that the
Spirit of the Lord worked mightily upon him', or according to the text <A NAME="p236"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|236</SPAN></A>
contained in other manuscripts, 'the Spirit of the Lord prospered his way' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#634"><SUP>634</SUP></A>;
and, though he opposed himself to God's laws, the grace of the Holy Spirit did
not abandon him. However it was not fornication on which they were bent, but
marriage. And again at the wedding-feast he composed a certain question, or
rather <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#635"><SUP>635</SUP></A> a riddle, and asked it of those
Philistines, fixing gifts for them and promising them so many garments and
articles of clothing, if they told him the solution of that riddle; but, if they
failed to find the origin of it and did not tell it, on the other hand he
appointed a similar present for them to give. So much for what he did: but they
could not find the interpretation of the question; but they persuade the woman
who had been united to him to get the answer to the riddle from him by a trick,
and make this known to them, as was in fact done. And thereupon those garments
had to be exacted from him; for the holy Scripture said, «The spirit of the
Lord came mightily upon him; and he went down to Ascalon, and there killed
thirty men; and he took their spoils, and gave their garments to those who
interpreted the riddle to him» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#636"><SUP>636</SUP></A>. Now mark here
again also how it said that the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him,
because he killed men alien to his race in fight, since God, as we have said,
permitted this <A NAME="p237"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|237</SPAN></A> same thing, that
these men should perish, as men who had oppressed Israel: and at every great and
wonderful and glorious deed that he did Scripture stated and said that the
Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#637"><SUP>637</SUP></A>.
And, after he had gone down to Gaza as is written <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#638"><SUP>638</SUP></A>,
and had there seen a harlot and gone in to her, he shone with the same brilliant
deeds and was resplendent with the same good successes, and with great power
advanced to such acts, God instigating him to these. Nevertheless after the
fornication on the occasion of the successes gained by him the divine Scripture
no longer stated that the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; for the sin
of fornication which is committed against the body, that is which is a sin
against God, is of such a kind as to drive away the Holy Spirit. Wherefore also
the wise Paul too says, «He who commits fornication sins against his own body»,
not as if the other sins were not objects of condemnation, for all of them
contain a falling from the kingdom, but for the reason that was stated he was
desirous to show that fornication is evil, and he wished to eradicate the
passion itself from every man, as from some root; because the <A NAME="p238"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|238</SPAN></A>
Corinthians sinned wickedly in this respect; for he said, «Such fornication is
reported among you, and fornication of such a kind that is not even named among
the peoples, that a man should have his father's wife&quot; <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#639"><SUP>639</SUP></A>.
He began with an accusation of this kind, founded upon the particular unlawful
intercourse, and he went on to use the spiritual knife against all fornication;
and he raised a charge of this kind to a height. Look at the strict mercifulness
of God, as in the history of Samson. As soon as he had committed fornication,
the grace of the sanctifying power of the Spirit departed from him, but it was
nevertheless poured out upon him in the power and operation of the successes
obtained by him, giving an opportunity for repentance by means of which every
sin is overthrown and cast out, unless we throw ourselves into the pit of
despair <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#640"><SUP>640</SUP></A>.</p>

<p>[508-11.] For not only the manifestations of wrath that arise from wars, but
also the chastisements of many kinds which are brought to pass from heaven for
our correction it is the habit of Scripture to call evils. For the prophet <A NAME="p239"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|239</SPAN></A>
Amos said, «Is there evil in a city which the Lord hath not done?» And,<i> </i>explaining
what an evil of this kind is, which is brought to pass by God in order to

<p><i>(A little farther on.) </i>Of these chastisements and calamities therefore
God is the maker, for our reproof and the repression of our sins. Indeed we also
call the things that are brought upon us by way of chastisement evils: and the

<p>[508-11] First he says, «I am he who formed light», and then he added, «and
made darkness;» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#643"><SUP>643</SUP></A> meaning this; that, because
he formed light, he himself <A NAME="p240"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|240</SPAN></A> made
darkness. If light had not existed first, darkness would not have been brought
into being, from the shield of the heavenly body. When light was formed, and
heaven was stretched like a roof over the earth, the space between became of
necessity <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#644"><SUP>644</SUP></A> not light, and so darkness was
accidentally brought into being, not having existed before; and for this reason
the maker of all had need to say, in order to illuminate the darkness that was
in the world, «Let there be light» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#645"><SUP>645</SUP></A>. All
darkness is brought about by reason of shadowing bodies; because, if bodies did
not exist in the way of the light, darkness would not result. The words are
moreover spoken in order to do away with the falsely-named gods, and that we may
know that he is the Creator of night and of day, and not, as the deceivers say,
that the Creator of light is one and the creator of darkness again
another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the phrase «maketh peace and createth evil» makes its interpretation
clear from the very understanding of the composition of the words: for he meant,
'Let everyone know that I am he who makes peace and creates evil'. What evil?
That which stands in active opposition to peace, that is wars, and devastations
of cities, which are justly brought upon us on account of our sins: just as,
when the sons of Israel sat in peace <A NAME="p241"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|241</SPAN></A>
and plenty, and afterwards left the Lord and turned aside to idolatry, God
delivered them into the hand of the Moabites, and at times to the sons of Ammon,

<p>[508-11.] For, after the fishermen had proclaimed the gospel and caught all
the world, the word of truth took teachers of the church from profane wisdom,
and seized them like vessels of sanctification (?) <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#647"><SUP>647</SUP></A>,
and, having given them to taste of the bowl of true wisdom, and satisfied them
with the unintoxicating drinks of the Holy Spirit, it sent them out like
fishermen and they caught those who were puffed up with the wisdom of the rulers
of this world on all mountains, that is by means of the very thoughts of false <A NAME="p242"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|242</SPAN></A>
knowledge which are supposed to be high and elevated. This was proclaimed
beforehand by Jeremiah the prophet when he said thus: «'Lo! I send out the many
fishermen', saith the Lord, 'and they shall catch them; and after these things I
will send out the many hunters, and they shall catch them on all mountains, and
on all high places'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#648"><SUP>648</SUP></A>; though indeed, when a
goodly spoil has been caught by the doctrines of divine wisdom, they reveal and
expose their own defeat by means of another prophecy, crying to God their
Saviour, «Behold us. We will be bondmen to thee, because tho.u art the Lord our
God, and truly the high places and the power of the mountains were reduced to
falsehood» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#649"><SUP>649</SUP></A>. But, if the thoughts of profane
wisdom are understood to be the low mountains, we shall consequently understand
that the gates of bronze which are shattered and the bars <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#650"><SUP>650</SUP></A>
of iron that are broken <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#651"><SUP>651</SUP></A> are the snares of
argument and the precise questions stated in words from which there is no
escape, which have many windings; questions which the truth has refuted and
dissolved, being, stronger than everything, which heaven also blesses, as Ezra
said <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#652"><SUP>652</SUP></A>; questions which Jeremiah calls 'holes of
the rocks', on account of the secrecy and obscurity and the <A NAME="p243"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|243</SPAN></A>
ambushes hard to see which the same objections contain; for «they shall catch
them», he says, «on all mountains, and on all high places and from the holes
of the rocks». For the low mountains may be understood in another way also as
those who are proud and arrogant in character, but are taught the gospel and
made lowly, and are changed so that they cast themselves on their faces on the
earth and converted to a humble demeanour by hearing the Teacher say, «Learn of
me for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#653"><SUP>653</SUP></A>,
and thereby another prophecy of Isaiah also is fulfilled in addition which says,
«All mountains and all high places shall be brought low, and the crooked places
shall be made straight, and those that have rough paths smooth, and all flesh
shall see God's salvation» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#654"><SUP>654</SUP></A>. But, if we call
the change of the souls of the haughty to a lowly demeanour the low mountains,
we shall not receive it as unfitting that the gates of bronze and the bars <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#655"><SUP>655</SUP></A>
of iron are the character of wickedness that is very wicked, that has not only
set men under the compulsion <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#656"><SUP>656</SUP></A> of nature, but
also <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#657"><SUP>657</SUP></A> brought them to such a state that they
cannot be reformed, since 'they have been constrained in their will', as
Jeremiah says, 'and <A NAME="p244"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|244</SPAN></A> become pieces
of flesh' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#658"><SUP>658</SUP></A>, so that they are not able to have
God's spirit dwelling in them. That character so to speak of gates of bronze and
bars <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#659"><SUP>659</SUP></A> </sup>of iron was shattered and
crushed by the power of the divine Incarnation by him who said, «The kingdom of
heaven belongs to violent men, and violent men seize it» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#660"><SUP>660</SUP></A>,
and, «I will give thee hidden and secret treasures, and invisible ones will I
open to thee that thou mayst know that I am the Lord God who calleth thy name,
the God of Israel, because of Jacob my bondman and Israel my chosen»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#661"><SUP>661</SUP></A>.
And we said before at the beginning of the composition that Cyrus searched the
very depths of the earth themselves in Babylon, and carried all the riches of
the Babylonians into captivity. This therefore God himself promises to Cyrus by
word of mouth, saying, «I will give thee hidden and secret treasures, and
invisible ones will I open to thee, that thou mayst know that I am the Lord thy
God, who called thy name, the God of Israel». But he uses the name 'kingdom',
on account of which he also termed him 'anointed' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#662"><SUP>662</SUP></A>.
«These», he says, «you shall find, because of Jacob my bondman and Israel my
chosen», <A NAME="p245"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|245</SPAN></A> whom also Cyrus brought
up from captivity: therefore he merited also the aforesaid rewards. It was
because of Cyrus therefore that the announcement was put together in this way:
but the aforestated words fit Christ the Saviour of us all also; for, if he
divested himself and became poor for our; sake while he is rich <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#663"><SUP>663</SUP></A>,
he does not refuse to have words used of him which befit his exinanition.</p>

<p>[522-6.] While walking in the way of righteousness (I mean that of
asceticism), and the monastic life, you meditate on the sublime thoughts of the
God-inspired Scriptures, and gather benefit from them, and shun lack of
knowledge and the poverty arising therefrom as something alien to the
commandments of religion, and for this disposition therefore you are an object
of praise. For the book of Proverbs also somewhere said, «The lips of the <A NAME="p246"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|246</SPAN></A>
righteous know high things, but fools die in scarcity». For this reason it has
decreed for you a blessing from above, and a life that is without sorrow and
blessed: for it adds, 'The blessing of the Lord upon the head of the righteous,
this maketh rich, and sorrow in heart shall not be added unto it» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#665"><SUP>665</SUP></A>.
It is therefore known beforehand that to me too you bring freedom from sorrow
through your God-loving questions, inasmuch as you cause me to enjoy the
pleasure of spiritual thoughts. Accordingly I will readily try to give an
elucidation of the rest <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#666"><SUP>666</SUP></A> of your questions
also. You are pleased to ask me what our Lord Jesus Christ wishes to make known
to us by that parable which Luke the Evangelist recorded as follows: «Who among
you shall have a friend, and he shall go unto him at midnight and say to him,
'My friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend hath come to me from a journey,
and I have not wherewith to set before him', and he from within shall answer and
say, 'Trouble me not. Lo! the door is shut, and my children with myself are in
bed. I cannot rise and give to thee'? I say unto you that, if he will not rise
and give to him because he is his friend, because of his importunity he will
rise and give him as much as he needeth». For <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#667"><SUP>667</SUP></A>,
us to find the reason of this parable from outside is foolish and senseless, <A NAME="p247"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|247</SPAN></A>
since our Saviour himself plainly added by his own words and declared that he
brought this forward to convince us that we ought to pray and make requests
without ceasing and at all times, readily <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#668"><SUP>668</SUP></A> and
without ever growing slack or weak from the constant habit <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#669"><SUP>669</SUP></A>:
for he added, «I also say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given unto you. Seek,
and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that
asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall
be opened unto him» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#670"><SUP>670</SUP></A>. In what precedes he
delivered to the disciples the form of that divine prayer which begins, «Our
Father which art in heaven» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#671"><SUP>671</SUP></A>; and so he added
to it the parable given above, so that on all sides the object'is clear. But,
since you have thought to yourself that there is some spiritual, sublime, lofty
allegory <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#672"><SUP>672</SUP></A> contained in the words of the
parable, and ask what those three loaves are, we ourselves also find it quite
impossible not to be uplifted with your instruction-loving and inquiring mind,
and to state the partial result which we have reached; for assuredly we must not
force the parables into an allegory <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#673"><SUP>673</SUP></A> in every
point. These <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#674"><SUP>674</SUP></A> three loaves I consider to be
faith in <A NAME="p248"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|248</SPAN></A> the Father and in the Son
and the Holy Spirit; to which it is reasonable to suppose that our Lord, the <i>'
</i>one of the Trinity ' is urging all men through these words; because indeed,
as the apostle said, he ' wisheth all men to be saved, and to come to the
knowledge of the truth' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#675"><SUP>675</SUP></A>. Since therefore some
have wasted all their life in negligence, and taken no account of the faith, and
at last towards the end of life come to a perception of their sins, and rush to
the faith, the merciful one says this: «Even men of this kind, who come and
knock at my door at an untimely hour of night, I will hear, not for the sake of
justice, but because of their importunity <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#676"><SUP>676</SUP></A>, and
I will hand to them the loaves of faith, which is the confession of the Holy
Trinity». The friend therefore, the master of the house, is the God and Saviour
Jesus <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#677"><SUP>677</SUP></A>, who loves every man, even those who
have not yet believed on him, and thirsts for their salvation. But he who asks
for the three loaves in the middle of the night is he who comes to the faith
late. But the friend who came from a journey and was received by him we should
afterwards rightly understand as the angel or angels who come at the end of life
to take us and <A NAME="p249"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|249</SPAN></A> conduct us on the
last journey; for they themselves also love us, and make our salvation a subject
of rejoicing, according to the testimony of our Lord which says, «Joy ariseth
before the angels of God over a sinner who repenteth»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#678"><SUP>678</SUP></A>.
But the children who are resting in the bed are those who have been brought up
as children, and have believed the gospel with a simple heart, and have been
judged worthy to rest with our Lord. For the lying on the bed also is a sign of
rest, as our Lord himself again says in the Gospel of Matthew: «Many shall come
from the east and from the west, and shall recline with Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob in the kingdom of heaven»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#679"><SUP>679</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>The words spoken by<i> </i>our Saviour to the Jews, «In order that upon you
may come all the blood, of righteous men that has been shed upon the earth, from
the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zacharias <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#680"><SUP>680</SUP></A>
whom ye <A NAME="p250"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|250</SPAN></A> slew between the temple
and the altar» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#681"><SUP>681</SUP></A>, have been variously
understood<i><sub> </sub></i>by those who have interpreted, because concerning
this matter nothing is plainly stated by the God-inspired Scripture. But, since
our Saviour's purpose requires that he should unite and comprise in the saying
all the blood of righteous men that was unjustly shed, from Abel down to the day
on which he himself said these things to the Jews, and lay the responsibility
for this upon them and upon their ancestors, it <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#682"><SUP>682</SUP></A>
is a right and reasonable thing, as it seems to me, to understand that he
referred to Zacharias the priest, who begot for us the holy <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#683"><SUP>683</SUP></A>
John the Forerunner and Baptist, whom a tradition not contained in Scripture
relates that the Jews slew between the temple and <A NAME="p251"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|251</SPAN></A>
the altar, because he plainly prophesied or rather <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#684"><SUP>684</SUP></A><i>
</i>showed the God-bearer to be a virgin <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#685"><SUP>685</SUP></A>, and
him that is born of her, the great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, like some King
and chief and Lord over their people, and did not remove the holy Virgin herself
after the incomprehensible conception by the Holy Spirit from the virgins' place
in the temple, between the temple and the altar, as one that was married, but
knew her to be still a virgin, and allowed her to stand in the same <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#686"><SUP>686</SUP></A>
accustomed place as usual. For this reason (they say) those who heard of it fell
into a rage and took weapons in their hands against him, fearing the king who
was expected from his <A NAME="p252"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|252</SPAN></A> prophecy,
who was to exercise sway over them and lay the yoke of bondage upon them. And
these things Gregory the wise in divine things, the brother of Basil the great,
and bishop of Nyssa, in the sermon on the Nativity of our Saviour, states thus:
«But, if we are not straying a long way from the subject, it would perhaps not
be inopportune to adduce Zacharias also who was slain between the temple and the
altar to testify to the undefiled mother. This Zacharias was a priest, but not a
priest only, but possessing also the gift of prophecy, and the power of prophecy
is proclaimed in the book of the gospel as inevitable <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#687"><SUP>687</SUP></A>,
in that the divine grace makes a way for men beforehand, that they may not think
the birth from a virgin incredible, and, training the assent of those who did
not believe beforehand by small miracles, a child <A NAME="p253"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|253</SPAN></A>
is born to her that is barren and past age <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#688"><SUP>688</SUP></A>.
This is the beginning of the miracle that is performed in the Virgin <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#689"><SUP>689</SUP></A>.
For, as Elizabeth does not become a mother by the power of nature, inasmuch as
she had grown old in the world <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#690"><SUP>690</SUP></A> without
bearing, but the boy's birth is referred to the divine will, so also the
incredibility of the virgin birth-throes obtains belief by reference to the
deity. Since therefore the son born of the barren woman, who at the voice of her
that had conceived the Lord, before he came forth to the light, leaped in his
mother's womb, preceded the son born of the virgin, immediately on the
forerunner of the Word coming forth to birth, then the silence of Zacharias is
dissolved, by the prophetic indwelling, and all things that Zacharias utters
were a prophecy of the future. This man therefore who was being led by the
spirit of prophecy to the knowledge of hidden <A NAME="p254"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|254</SPAN></A>
things, having understood the mystery of virginity in the undefiled birth, did
not exclude the unmarried mother in the temple from the place which according to
the law was assigned to the virgins, teaching the Jews that the Maker of the
things that are and Ring of all creation has human nature under his rule with
all things, and by his own will leads it to that which pleases him, and is not
himself controlled by this nature, so that it is in his power to make a new form
of birth which will not cause her who has become a mother to cease from being a
virgin. Therefore he did not exclude her in the temple from the ranks of the
virgins; and this place was a space between the temple and the altar. Since
therefore they heard that the King of creation was coming forth <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#691"><SUP>691</SUP></A>
by dispensation to human birth, in fear of being under a king's rule they slew
the man who testified these things <A NAME="p255"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|255</SPAN></A>
concerning the birth, sacrificing <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#692"><SUP>692</SUP></A> the priest
at the very altar» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#693"><SUP>693</SUP></A>. But of the Zacharias who
was one of the twelve prophets we cannot reasonably understand the passage
quoted, since it is not related that he was killed, but he departed from life by
the ordinary end of human life. Wherefore also in the times of the pious king
Theodosius the grandson of the elder Theodosius his holy body was found by
revelation in the territory of Eleutheropolis, when it had not been in the least
corrupted but was found as if it had been buried yesterday, at a place at which
an oratory is now to be seen, and a temple which was consecrated to God in his
name; and it is known and honoured by all who pass by that way. This is related
by a certain Sozomen who wrote ecclesiastical histories <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#694"><SUP>694</SUP></A>.
Some have supposed that in the above-quoted passage our Saviour referred to
Zacharias the son of Jehoiada who was put to death by Joash, king of the Jews.
But this explanation is futile, and is refuted by the facts themselves. For it
is not the case that the foul murder of prophets and priests, the murder which
it is the intention of the <A NAME="p256"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|256</SPAN></A>
evangelic saying of our Saviour to set forth, was perpetrated down to his time
and then ended: for after Joash other kings of the Jews also reigned who turned
aside to idolatry, and, as is natural, were ill-disposed towards those who
pleased God; among whom Manasseh is said to have put Isaiah the great among
prophets to death with a saw. But besides these things we should know this also,
that the man who was put do death by Joash was called Azarias and not Zacharias,
though in certain copies some men have changed the name, and by a slight change
have written 'Azarias' as 'Zacharias' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#695"><SUP>695</SUP></A>.
Accordingly for all these reasons it seems to be a just conclusion that we must
consequently understand our Saviour's saying of the father of John the Baptist,
as the holy Gregory said.</p>
<p>Of the passage written by the wise Paul in the first epistle to the
Corinthians, «He that speaketh with tongues edifieth himself, but he that
prophesieth edifieth the church <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#696"><SUP>696</SUP></A>», this is the
elucidation. In the times in which the apostles were &quot;propagating the
saving preaching of the gospel in the <A NAME="p257"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|257</SPAN></A>
world, many of those who believed worked signs and prodigies, in order to bring
unbelievers to accept the truth. For it is for this cause that miracles are
numerous among unbelievers, and not among those who have already believed,
according to the saying of the same Paul <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#697"><SUP>697</SUP></A>. For
this very same reason the gifts of the Spirit were given with greater
liberality, and more openly, to these who were being brought to the faith. And
those who were baptized often spoke with tongues immediately, and some were
thought worthy to receive prophetic inspiration, while certain others even
enjoyed the possession of both, as is written in the book of the Acts about some
men who were baptized by Paul at Ephesus, as follows: «But, when they had heard
it, <A NAME="p258"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|258</SPAN></A> they were baptized in the name
of the Lord Jesus. And, when Paul had laid his hand upon them, the Holy Spirit
came upon them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#698"><SUP>698</SUP></A>.
This grace therefore flourished among the Corinthians also at that time, and
some used to speak with tongues, while others were thought worthy to prophesy.
And the form of prophecy was such that it was made known not only by foretelling
the future but also by the commingling of words of instruction which corrected
morals, as the God-clad doctors such as Athanasius the great and Basil, and such
as Gregory and John, and all who were like these, gained renown at one time and
another in the churches. Since therefore certain men at Corinth were puffed up
and thought much of themselves because they spoke with <A NAME="p259"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|259</SPAN></A>
tongues, while others prophesied and taught things useful and beneficial, Paul,
wishing to bring down their high looks, says this: «He who speaks with the
tongues of the nations edifies himself, that is, establishes his own reputation,
and is admired only, but does not benefit the soul of the hearers by reforming
morals: but he who prophesies and weaves a web of moral teaching, and reproves
secret things of the heart, and purifies the souls of the hearers from shameful
passions, edifies the church, and acquires the gift of prophesy or of teaching
for others rather <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#699"><SUP>699</SUP></A> than for himself».</p>
<p>The meaning of Job's saying, «May the blessing of him that hath perished
come upon me» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#700"><SUP>700</SUP></A> is plain to those who read with intelligence and not
carelessly from the fact that it follows the words which precede, and from <A NAME="p260"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|260</SPAN></A>
the words which next follow. This is what he says: «Often have I seen a man
suffering extreme tortures, and just on the point of perishing, as perhaps when
enemies were upon him, or violent men, and have rescued him from distress<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#701"><SUP>701</SUP></A>
and saved him; and such a one has blessed me, because against all hope he had
been delivered from the destruction that was impending over him<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#702"><SUP>702</SUP></A>. May that blessing therefore come upon me, and
may God bring it to effect» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#703"><SUP>703</SUP></A>. That this is so the words which follow
will prove as I said before. What in fact does he say? «For I delivered the
poor from the hand of the powerful, and I helped the orphan who had no helper. May
the blessing of him that hath perished come upon me; and the mouth <A NAME="p261"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|261</SPAN></A>
of the widow hath blessed me» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#704"><SUP>704</SUP></A>. But one may also understand this
in a higher sense as a parable. For our Lord also says in the gospels about
those who mortify their soul to the world, and give up their body to the arena <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#705"><SUP>705</SUP></A>
of martyrdom, or to labours of asceticism, and are thereby thought to be
destroying and slaying their soul, because they are deprived of worldly
pleasure: «He that destroyeth his soul for my sake shall find it» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#706"><SUP>706</SUP></A>.
The prayer and blessing therefore of a man who has thus perished according to
our Saviour's saying and finds his soul is a great thing: and any right-minded
man will pray that this may come upon him, and will wisely say the words, «May
the blessing of him that hath perished come upon me».
</p>
<p>As to what is written at the end of the book of Job, that he took an Arabian <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#707"><SUP>707</SUP></A>
wife, it is unnecessary for us to inquire much who this is, <A NAME="p262"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|262</SPAN></A>
whether this is another wife by whom he had other children after the calamity,
or the former one, who under the magnitude of the afflictions that came upon him
gave way and stumbled, and advised him to utter some blasphemous speech and
depart from his pains. However it is reasonable for us to understand that the
wife by whom the children after the calamity were born was some other one
different from her. For it is as if adding something new that the writer uses
the words: «Having taken an Arabian wife he begets a son» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#708"><SUP>708</SUP></A>. For it
would have been far from just that she should share in the good things, who
shrank in the time of the struggle, and tried to bring the combatant <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#709"><SUP>709</SUP></A><sup>&nbsp;</sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#710"><SUP></SUP></A>
down from the highest summit of endurance. <A NAME="p263"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|263</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The words that were written by the writer in the book, and these also about
Job, of whom it is written that he also 'shall again rise with those whom the
Lord raiseth' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#710"><SUP>710</SUP></A>, we must suppose to have been composed with this
meaning. In consequence of so great a trial he had in a sense gone down to Sheol
and final destruction, so that even his name should thenceforth be extinguished,
as he himself said when he was being tormented by the pains&nbsp;<sup> <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#711"><SUP>711</SUP></A></sup>, and
suddenly he arose as from the dead, and put off the unsightliness of the sores,
and he was comely in body, as in the bloom of youth, and everything ended for
him in a change to the best fortune. Therefore, lest any think that the prize of
virtue ends with these things, and lest we who read imagine that we shall receive
the rewards for the labours <A NAME="p264"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|264</SPAN></A> of virtue in this world, for this reason the writer recorded the words that
are written, «He shall again rise with those whom the Lord raiseth»; that is,
lest any think that his rewards are completed and ended with present things: for
these were given as an earnest for the things that are future and are expected
by us all. For he shall rise with those whom the Lord raiseth, viz. those who
have conducted themselves after the same pattern, of whom Paul also in writing
to the Hebrews says that all those who have borne testimony through faith 'did
not receive the promises, God having provided some better thing for us, that
they might not be made perfect without us'<sup><sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#712"><SUP>712</SUP></A></sup></sup>. By the words which he
used (and it is written, «He shall <A NAME="p265"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|265</SPAN></A>
again rise with those whom the Lord raiseth») the writer is thought to be
explaining this also, that he endured such pains, not because he looked to the
things that were given him in this.world, but to the hope of the great and
wonderful resurrection, concerning which also he said, «I will endure for thee
until I shall again be» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#713"><SUP>713</SUP></A>; and again, «For I know that he ever
floweth who shall release me upon the earth. He shall raise my skin which
endureth these things»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#714"><SUP>714</SUP></A>. The words which are before us for the
purpose of interpretation were used by the author with reference to the general
resurrection which is expected by everyone (and the words are «He shall again
rise with those whom the Lord raiseth»), and not, as your religiousness has
supposed, to that by which some of the saints rose, <A NAME="p266"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|266</SPAN></A>
when our Lord took the saving Cross upon him for our sakes, and the Good
Shepherd laid down his soul for the sheep. For this the holy <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#715"><SUP>715</SUP></A>
Matthew
the Evangelist recorded in these words: «But Jesus, when he had cried with a
loud voice, gave up the ghost. And lo! the veil of the temple was rent in two,
from the top to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent, and
the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who slept arose, and came
out from the graves, and after his resurrection went into the holy city, and
appeared to many» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#716"><SUP>716</SUP></A>. Since then the Evangelist stated indefinitely
that many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep rose, it is unnecessary for
us to inquire who these were, and if Job was among them. For the reason why he
said 'many', and not 'all the bodies of the saints' is because the resurrection
which is expected by everyone is not that one, <A NAME="p267"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|267</SPAN></A>
but the one at the second coming of our Saviour Christ. For then, I mean at
the time of the revered Gross, it was only in order to demonstrate the power of
our same Saviour, who in that the soul separated from the body went down to
Sheol, that certain men rose by a divine manifestation, showing that in the
places beneath the earth there was perception of the God-befitting illumination.
And these were prophets and some of those who lived after the same manner as
they, who were well-known from the Holy Scriptures among the inhabitants of
Jerusalem. This is stated also by the God-clad Ignatius, who adorned the throne of the Antiochenes, immediately after the
apostolic administration <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#717"><SUP>717</SUP></A>, and the first see of the chief of the
apostles Peter, and was perfected with a crown of martyrdom. In writing-to those
at <A NAME="p268"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|268</SPAN></A> Magnesia he wrote as follows about our Saviour Christ: «How shall we be able
to live without him? whom the prophets also, being his disciples in the spirit,
expected as a teacher; and for this reason he whom they rightly awaited when he
came raised them from the dead»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#718"><SUP>718</SUP></A>. But that we should think that
those who rose then, at the time of the saving Cross, remained to this day the
words of the gospel do not permit; for they cry plainly, «They went into the
holy city and appeared to many». The word 'appeared' plainly denotes a
temporary appearance, for the purpose of confirming, as we <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#719"><SUP>719</SUP></A>
said, the
power of our Saviour, who broke the gates of bronze, and the bars of iron <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#720"><SUP>720</SUP></A>
from which there is no escape, of the places <A NAME="p269"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|269</SPAN></A>
beneath the earth. After therefore those who rose had shown themselves at
that time, they again laid their bodies aside and departed to their places,
awaiting the general resurrection which is expected by everyone. That this is
so, the holy John bishop of Constantinople also testifies in the fourteenth note
of the second part of the commentary on the first epistle to the Corinthians,
where he wrote thus: «But if any be in doubt why, when speaking about the
resurrection, he did not here introduce the bodies which rose in our Lord's
time, we will say this, that this is not speaking about the resurrection. For to
show that those who rose die again was alien to the purpose of one who is
showing that death is finally destroyed. For it is for this reason also that he
said that it is the last thing to be destroyed, in order that you may no longer
fear that it will rise. For, when evil is <A NAME="p270"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|270</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
done away, much more shall death be annihilated» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#721"><SUP>721</SUP></A>. And in the
fifteenth note which follows, when speaking about saving baptism, and explaining
why a man who is about to be baptized, when he repeats <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#722"><SUP>722</SUP></A>
the baptismal
confession, is baptized into the remission of sins and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal life, he says this: «For, since sin brought in death, the
root being dried up, we must no longer dispute in any way about the: destruction
of the fruit. Therefore after first saying 'the remission of sin', he then
confesses <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#723"><SUP>723</SUP></A> also the resurrection of the dead, being led from this to
that also. And afterwards, since the name 'resurrection' does not suffice to set
forth everything (for many after they had risen departed again,' as <A NAME="p271"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|271</SPAN></A>
those in the Old Testament, as Lazarus, as those at the time of the Cross)
you are bidden <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#724"><SUP>724</SUP></A> to say, 'and in eternal life', that none may any
longer fear death after that resurrection» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#725"><SUP>725</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>We have now discharged, as you see, all the God-loving debt of your, esteemed
questions, according to our feebleness, and according to the small measure of
knowledge which has come to us; and we pray that there may fall to you the
glorious part of Mary, who never tired of bending her instruction-loving ear to
the saving teaching of Jesus, and upon whom that testimony was given which said,
«For Mary hath chosen for herself the good part, which shall not be taken from
her» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#726"><SUP>726</SUP></A>. But, whereas in the previous letter to us you stated how your
religious brother Innocent and the sisters stand in the faith, and after writing
this about them, as if you had done something contrary to the profession of
philosophy, you then added that you take no «thought for them, know clearly
that it is not a thing unworthy of your perfection that as regards the faith and
in fitting spiritual matters you should take thought for those who are related
to you, and perform all that is in your power, and give assistance with counsels
and <A NAME="p272"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|272</SPAN></A> prayers. For in these things our duty consists; and to this also the
apostolic saying extends, «If any man taketh no thought for his own and
especially those of the house, he denieth the faith, and is worse than an
unbeliever» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#727"><SUP>727</SUP></A>. And that we should take thought for their worldly
opulence, or for anything else that is pleasant, is the part of those who are
not philosophers. This distinction therefore I too made, and asked the love of
God that is in you to write to me about them; and you have done well in telling
everything both wisely and in accordance with truth; and it is proper that the
distinction in this point also should not escape you. Upon another matter you
have asked me questions of this kind. 1 have heard that Isaiah <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#728"><SUP>728</SUP></A>
the
unlawful, like Dathan and Abiram, has risen against the laws of the priesthood,
and has trampled upon everything like a hog, with foul, disorderly, uncanonical
feet; and that, having gone to Pamphylia, he has thought fit to whisper lies
about me, and to say that in what I wrote about the incorruptibility of the body
of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#729"><SUP>729</SUP></A> I proclaimed the faith, and said
that the body was corrupted and dissolved during the three days' burial, and
certain similar blasphemies which are not plausible, which wound the ears, and
disturb the souls, of those who listen without intelligence: and it <A NAME="p273"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|273</SPAN></A>
is therefore in my mind to send a man there carrying all that has been
written by me, in order to establish the truth. If then you also have heard of
any similar report that has been whispered there, since some persons have
perhaps written and told you, tell me. The statement on which you have dilated
in the letter, as to how you have loved and still love my humility with peculiar
warmth, I read with great pleasure, and I rejoiced with spiritual joy on
learning the fervour of the love that is in you, the God-befitting and pure
love, wherewith rational souls are smitten towards one another, even among those
with whom you associate in the blood of Christ. But I believe of you that, even
if you write at very great length in every letter, you will not be able to
express even a small portion of the love and confidence that you have towards
me, who am unworthy and fall far short of this. But I pray that for this perfect
love you may receive rewards both in this world, and in the future and endless
life.

<p>[522-6.] But the words used in the 126<sup>th </sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#733"><SUP>733</SUP></A>
Psalm, which is the 8<sup>th</sup>
of the Songs of Ascents, «As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of the
shaken», should receive this interpretation. But the words contained in this
statement apply also in a higher sense to each man's soul which by means of
deeds of repentance is built up and renovated to form a holy temple of God.
Those who returned from Babylon to this tangible and visible Jerusalem became
sons of the shaken; who after captivity came to repentance, and by means of many
trials were driven this way and that and shaken, and produced fruits of
repentance, and thereby merited the return. But those who build up their own
soul are in another sense sons of the shaken. <A NAME="p275"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|275</SPAN></A>
Divine Scripture calls the holy prophets and apostles, and all who conducted
themselves like these, 'the shaken', because they shook out of their own soul
like ashes all earthliness, whether thought or action, and all the likeness of
the creature of dust and of the old man, and introduced into and impressed upon
themselves instead of these the likeness of the heavenly one <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#734"><SUP>734</SUP></A>
by
means of a new life, as through the mouth of Isaiah our Lord is introduced
saying to Jerusalem, and raising her obediently (?) from earthly deeds, «Shake
the dust from thee and rise» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#735"><SUP>735</SUP></A>. And a garment that is shaken is not
eaten by moth, and remains whole and uneaten. So therefore also those who by
means of earnestness that is not eaten by evil things have been preserved for
the adoption are understood to be and are called shaken. And again. Those who
like smooth rocks that cannot be broken receive without changing the waves of
this world and the assault of trials will therefore be understood and that very
rightly to be shaken : and the sons of those who are shaken are the teachers of
the church, who are held like arrows in the hand of a mighty man. For God the
Lord of hosts is able to shoot those who through the same men learn religion, and to send into their
<A NAME="p276"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|276</SPAN></A> hearts the arrow of wisdom, the arrow of righteousness, the arrow of love in
him, which comprises all the virtues; and through the same men also he shoots
those too who oppose the word of truth, sending shafts of reproofs to effect a
saving restoration if they will. To these sons of the shaken therefore, who are as arrows in the hand of a mighty man, he next
gives a blessing, and says, «Blessed is the man who shall fill his desire from
them» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#736"><SUP>736</SUP></A>,<i> </i>for a blessing is given to the teacher who fills his
desire by means of such arrows. But what else is the teacher's desire except the
things that are for the profit of the souls of those that are saved? And this
therefore should be understood not of a teacher only, but also of every
Christian who lives virtuously, and through his own manner of life shoots
everyone else as with arrows, and draws them to his own pattern. For those who
so teach, or live, 'shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in
the gate' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#737"><SUP>737</SUP></A>; and the gate is the exit from this world. For, even when
they depart from the world, and take the last journey, and are about to go to the actual presence of their God himself, the demons the enemies of man's
life are no longer able to encounter them; because, when they take <A NAME="p277"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|277</SPAN></A>
the last departure, those holy ones are not silent, but speak with the high
voice of deeds, and in company with the rulers, I mean with the good and angelic
hosts, who come to receive them, sing songs of victory and thanksgiving,
according to what is said in the 67<sup>th</sup> Psalm, «Rulers went in front
following singers, in the midst of damsels beating tambourines» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#738"><SUP>738</SUP></A>.
And he applies the expression 'damsels beating tambourines' to the souls which
show youthful prowess over evil passions, and like tambourines have deadened the
bodies and fleshly desires.

</blockquote>
<p>[522-6.] As to the words therefore which the Evangelist Matthew wrote that
our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ used: «Pray that your flight be not
in the winter nor on the sabbath» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#739"><SUP>739</SUP></A>, know that they have a double
meaning, and as a historical fact this has already happened to the Jews at
the time <A NAME="p278"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|278</SPAN></A> of the captivity at the hands of the Romans
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#740"><SUP>740</SUP></A>, but in a higher
sense it is expected to take place at the end of the whole world. In fact after
the outrage on the cross the judgment of God-slayers was exacted from them when
the Romans took arms against them, and encamped over all Judaea and over the
country round for whole years, and during the winter-seasons the evil
consequences of war prevailed, and these especially in the winter when the
fighting-men were idle; and not so only, but on the sabbath also they were
slaughtered, because on account of the cessation of the sabbath they could not
take arms in their hands and exact vengeance from those who were fighting with
them. And this is often recorded by those who described the calamities of those
men, that, by reason of the distress of the calamities which came upon them,
they disregarded even the cessation of the sabbath, and took arms against their
adversaries: nevertheless even so they fell with a complete and lamentable fall,
and endured utter ruin. But, when our Saviour's words in respect of this
prophecy are raised in meaning so as to refer to the time of the end and of
Antichrist, it induces believers <A NAME="p279"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|279</SPAN></A> always to persevere in works of virtue, and strive not to be caught by the
winter or by the sabbath, at the time of the end, or the departure of every soul
and its separation from the body, the winter signifying absence of fruit, and
the sabbath cessation from virtue: for we know that the winter is unproductive
as regards the production of fruit, and that the sabbath signifies cessation.
For the winter, in which there is much rain and falls of snow, and gathering of
clouds and a murky atmosphere <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#741"><SUP>741</SUP></A>, and scarceness of pure air
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#741"><SUP>741</SUP></A>,
may denote confusion. The intention of the saying therefore is that our souls
should be active and fruitful, and free from confusion as regards readiness and
preparation for acts of religion, as in the words sung by David the prophet, «I
was made ready and was not confounded» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#742"><SUP>742</SUP></A>. In the same way should
also be interpreted the saying, «Woe to them that are with child and to them
that suckle in those days» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#743"><SUP>743</SUP></A>. For this also occurred as a historical
fact throughout Judaea, when the hand of the Romans fought with them, so that
the women who were with child and those who were <A NAME="p280"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|280</SPAN></A>
suckling were pitifully slain with their children themselves, either while they
were yet in the womb or while they were being nourished at the breast. And in a
higher sense on the last day the souls are to be reckoned as objects of pity
which received in the mind the practice of virtue and bear it as in a womb, and
began to hold the seed of the word of religion, which was with difficulty
conceived in them, which bring forth to the light and as it were give birth, but
produce the thing itself in very imperfect form, like women who are unable to
give perfect nourishment to their babies. For those who cultivate virtue must
according to the parable that is in the gospel bear the full measure so as to
rise to the number of 100, or produce fruit of the measure of 60, or at least of
30; for what is less than this should like an incompletely-formed and
unnourished babe be reckoned as nothing.
</p>
<p>But the saying «Where the corpse is, there will the eagles be gathered
together» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#744"><SUP>744</SUP></A> is spoken as a kind of simile and proverb and
illustration. As, when a dead body is found lying anywhere, both eagles and
other birds of <A NAME="p281"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|281</SPAN></A> prey come from different quarters from very lofty heights, suddenly and
unexpectedly, in order to be fed, 'in the same way' (he says) 'shall be also the
coming of the Son of man' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#745"><SUP>745</SUP></A>, for, when he shall again appear upon the
earth, at the glorious second coming to judge the world, and shall appear with
armed ranks of angels, all the saints also, rising 'suddenly and in the
twinkling of an eye at the last trump' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#746"><SUP>746</SUP></A>, as the apostle said, shall
suddenly all appear like some swift eagles of rapid motion. And very rightly
were they compared to eagles, because they had high and heavenly thoughts, and
lived in a manner worthy of the kingdom of heaven. But some have tried to
interpret this saying in the following way, and have said that at the Lord's
second coming all those who have lived a righteous life, and were like high and
heavenly eagles in their mind, shall receive Paradise, and shall be gathered in
the same place where Adam's fall <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#747"><SUP>747</SUP></A> was, and the disobedience through
which he fell into sin. Of the words, «Two men shall be at that time m the
field, one is taken away and one left, two women shall be grinding <A NAME="p282"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|282</SPAN></A>
in the mill, one is taken away and one left» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#748"><SUP>748</SUP></A> this is the
explanation. The field is the world, according to what was said by our Saviour,
«He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; but the field is the world»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#749"><SUP>749</SUP></A>.
Those therefore who have received the seed of the gospel, and the word of
religion, while they are in the field and at work, either are taken into the
kingdom because they are working and acting strenuously, or are left and remain
as men who are indolent and slothful and lax. And the mill after the same model
is this world, in which we pass our <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#750"><SUP>750</SUP></A> time as at a mill, eating bread
by labour and toil; and some strenuously undergo hardship and exertion in works
of righteousness, while others spend their time in vain acts which pass away
like a shadow. And on account of those things <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#751"><SUP>751</SUP></A> therefore it is
<A NAME="p283"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|283</SPAN></A> manifest that some are taken and others left. But the very wise Luke the
Evangelist wrote this passage in the following form: «In this night there shall
be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left. There shall be two
women grinding together; the one shall be taken away but the other left» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#752"><SUP>752</SUP></A>.
And these things are brought about beforehand by each act, of the rich that is
and of the poor, some of whom because they have done deeds worthy of the kingdom
of heaven shall be taken, while others who have been negligent shall be left.
For indeed even those who are in bed, those that is to say who enjoy ease in
this world, and are in the portion of the rich, who <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#753"><SUP>753</SUP></A>, if they
administer the riches well, shall earn the privilege <A NAME="p284"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|284</SPAN></A>
of the kingdom of God, but those who spend this on vanities will justly be
despised and put to contempt. But by the work of the mill those again are
denoted who live in poverty and contempt, according to what is said in Exodus,
«And all the firstborn shall die in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of
Pharaoh who sitteth on his throne down to the firstborn of the bondwoman who is
in the mill-house»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#754"><SUP>754</SUP></A>; so that from this it is manifest that the name
of [mill-house or <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#755"><SUP>755</SUP></A>] mill signifies the utter contempt and poverty of
those who continue in such service for the sake of daily sustenance. Accordingly
our Lord's saying in the gospel signifies that both from among the rich who
enjoy ease upon beds, and from among the utterly poor who are occupied in
contemptible employments on the last day some shall be found, of whom <A NAME="p285"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|285</SPAN></A>
some will be saved, while others will perish, and neither poverty nor riches
are <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#756"><SUP>756</SUP></A> impediments to him who seeks to live in the fear of God, in
order to earn the kingdom of heaven. But some have said that the words «Two
women shall be grinding in the mill, one is taken and one is left» were meant
by our Saviour to refer to those who teach in the church. For those men grind
the word of teaching as in a mill for those who learn, and lay rational bread
before them, suprasensually feeding the souls. Wherefore also they say that what
is written in Deuteronomy, «Thou shalt hot take a millstone nor an upper
millstone in pledge, because this man taketh a soul in pledge» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#757"><SUP>757</SUP></A>, was
meant to refer to teaching, that a teacher must not lay them under any debt and
bond of debt, since the souls of those who are <A NAME="p286"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|286</SPAN></A>
taught are taken in pledge, and made void <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#758"><SUP>758</SUP></A> in respect of the
principles of religion and the hope that arises thence. And this holy Scripture
signifies in Koheleth also, saying of the time of the end, «And the
grinding-women ceased because they had became few» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#759"><SUP>759</SUP></A>. Then
accordingly all teaching shall be silent, and labour and toil, when those who
have previously performed shall receive rewards: for neither is it time then for
them to teach or perform. Therefore Paul in writing to the Galatians said: «Therefore
then while we have time let us work that which is good» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#760"><SUP>760</SUP></A>. This then
is what our Saviour said: «Then shall there be two women grinding» (and that
means souls occupied in teaching), «one is taken and one is left»: and he who
has taught the things that belong to religion, and has set the sound word
without detraction and accurately before the rational sheep is taken <A NAME="p287"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|287</SPAN></A>
into the kingdom, but he who has detracted from <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#761"><SUP>761</SUP></A>
the teaching by
heretical doctrines and deceived many, who by his own deceit has injured some,
shall be left and sent outside the kingdom, having extreme judgments exacted from him on account of the wrong that he has done. Those again upon the roof
they interpreted as those who have stood at the height of eminence.

the different abodes; so that one is first, and another second, and another
third, and others lower, as each prepared his conduct. But the first rank

very same faith, and therefore all were with equal honour termed 'good soil',
yet all had not the same capacity. Accordingly therefore among the crowns that

<p>[532-8 (?)] Your modesty's highness asked me some time ago why towards the
end of the proverbs of Solomon we find this heading placed among them, as it
were between two lines: «These are the indiscriminate admonitions or proverbs
of Solomon, which the friends of Hezekiah king of Judah set down or arranged» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#775"><SUP>775</SUP></A>;
and it seems to me that the sentence bears some such meaning as this; that the
proverbs contained in the book down to this heading are those which were
discriminately arranged as one may say in one corpus and volume, that is which
were set down in order and collected, Solomon having so arranged them; but many
others also which were spoken by him as in short utterances were in a scattered
way current. And the book of Kingdoms also states this, that Solomon spoke 3000
proverbs or parables <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#776"><SUP>776</SUP></A>, from those therefore that were set down in a
scattered way, confusedly <A NAME="p292"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|292</SPAN></A> and indiscriminately, not as in a series and collection, Hezekiah's friends
chose these, brought them into one order and collection, and added them to the
book itself. You certainly do not forget that Hezekiah was a lover of God and an
observer of the commandments of the law. Consequently therefore some learned
Hebrews, wise in the divine words, took the trouble to dispose these
indiscriminate and confused proverbs in some order, put them together as in one
corpus, and presented them as a rational present to the king.

fire, and by the impartial judgment, be shown to be genuine, and of necessity <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#778"><SUP>778</SUP></A>
it abides and is not destroyed. But, if one of the falsely-named teachers has
used defiled and spurious doctrines, like pieces of wood and reeds and hay, this
man's doctrine does not endure the fire, but, as soon as it is brought into

passed to us, as if these fell to our nature by lot, for man's nature was from

<p>[519-38.] «Give a portion to seven, also to eight» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#785"><SUP>785</SUP></A>. This has
this elucidation. In six days, as the writings of the blessed Moses mystically
teach us, God made this visible world, and on the seventh he rested. This same
period therefore during which we men live in this world, like a wheel, turns and
revolves round itself in the space of seven days, but at the end it gives up the
course and this circular movement; and thereafter rises a great much-beloved
light, that of the last day, with which there is no night, but this day is one
thing extending without end, and does not pass into another; the day on which
the Lord the Judge will come, and 'will reward every man according to his works'
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#786"><SUP>786</SUP></A>, and to those who have lived well, and are prepared by zealous
actions, he will reveal the good things which ' eye hath not seen, <A NAME="p296"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|296</SPAN></A>
and ear hath not heard, and which have not gone up into the heart of man' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#787"><SUP>787</SUP></A>,
and the whole kingdom of heaven itself. This last and renowned day without
evening therefore is one reckoned by itself: but, if a man reckons it with the
seven days of this world, he mentions it in the sequence of the eighth <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#788"><SUP>788</SUP></A>;
the day for which all who have believed in Christ are made ready by good
actions, yearning to be admitted to the good things in it, which do not wither,
which belong to the angels only. This therefore is (<i>he </i><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#789"><SUP>789</SUP></A>

previous time did not display. What also shall we in fact say, when our
Saviour himself cries in the gospel about the things that shall happen in the
last times, «For there shall be then great tribulation, such as hath not been
from the beginning of the world unto now, and shall not be» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#794"><SUP>794</SUP></A>? Or
what solution shall we devise in consideration of the plagues beyond conception
which John the son of thunder named, when he had mysteries revealed to him in
the wonderful revelation? Shall we say that these things also fall under the
words of Koheleth? But how is it not unreasonable, and a thing that plainly
contends against the truth, and against the sacred Scriptures?

<p>[519-38.] If Jews and heathens accepted the words of the apostles, we should
have said what Peter says in the second epistle: «One day with the Lord is as a
<A NAME="p299"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|299</SPAN></A>&nbsp;thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord delayeth not from
his promise, as some reckon delay; but he is long-suffering toward us not
wishing that any should perish, but that all men should come to repentance, but
the day of the Lord will come as a thief, wherein the heavens shall pass away
with a cry, the elements shall be burnt and dissolved» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#796"><SUP>796</SUP></A>. But, since
those men are under no obligation <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#797"><SUP>797</SUP></A> to bow to the writings of the New
Testament <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#798"><SUP>798</SUP></A>, but from this source yet more increase their unbelief, we
will produce a demonstration for them from the prophetic words. Daniel the seer
of those divine visions hard of interpretation, when he was explaining
Nebuchadnezzar's dream, and was revealing the heterogeneousness of the image
that appeared to him in the dream, which was composed of gold and silver and
bronze and iron and earthenware, and by the diversity of the materials <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#799"><SUP>799</SUP></A>
signified the various kingdoms, said of Christ's kingdom as follows: «And in
the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall not
be destroyed for ever; and his kingdom shall not pass to another people. It
shall break in pieces and scatter all the kingdoms and itself shall stand for
ever» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#800"><SUP>800</SUP></A>. Those therefore who proclaimed <A NAME="p300"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|300</SPAN></A>
the gospel applied the term 'last days' to the days of Christ's kingdom and
the evangelic life.
</p>
<p>John the Evangelist also when he said in his epistle, «Children, it is the
last season» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#801"><SUP>801</SUP></A>, did not speak falsely. For it is in fact the custom
to apply the term 'seasons' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#802"><SUP>802</SUP></A> not only to those of the days, but also
to those of the whole year: for the whole course of the year is divided into the
spring season, the summer season, the autumn season, and the winter season; and
the winter was in truth that of godlessness, which covered the whole world, in
which there was all spiritual barrenness, and coldness as regards the fervour of
the divine Spirit, and the whole earth was completely devoid of the gifts from
heaven, when Christ 'the Sun of righteousness' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#803"><SUP>803</SUP></A>
by his coming in
the flesh dawned upon us.
</p>
<p>And, to put it in another way, since 5000 years and more had passed since the
world came into being, as the writings of Moses have handed down to us, and from
Christ's coming there has not yet been completed as much as 600 or 700 or 1000
years<sup>4</sup> (let us concede this), how can it appear unreasonable to apply
the term ' last' to the days of the 600 years or may be 1000, <A NAME="p301"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|301</SPAN></A>
'when compared with those of the 5000? Johannes also in the 34<sup>th</sup>
homily of the Commentary on the Gospel of John uses these words, which agree
with the above sentiments: «For whence do you know, O man, that the end is not
near and that the things mentioned will occur after a short time <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#804"><SUP>804</SUP></A>?
For, as we do not say that the last day is the end of the year, but also the
last month, although it contains 30 days, so also, even if I call 400 years the
end of so large a number of years, I shall not be wrong» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#805"><SUP>805</SUP></A>.

</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>[519-38.] We say that according to the letter the law was abolished through
Christ, but that in the spirit it was much more fully brought to confirmation.
But what were the things of the letter? Sacrifices, sprinklings, various
temporary cleansings repeated at stated times, and other similar things, which
were different from heathen demon-worship, but prefigured the truth as in a
shadow, as Paul also says: «For the law contained a shadow of the future good
things, not the very image of the facts» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#810"><SUP>810</SUP></A>. In the
<A NAME="p303"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|303</SPAN></A> same way Gregory the Theologian <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#811"><SUP>811</SUP></A>
also in the homily on the Holy
Spirit wrote thus: «The first, when it cut away idols conceded sacrifices: the
second, when it caused sacrifices to pass away, did not forbid circumcision. But
afterwards, when they had once accepted the suppression, they conceded even what
had been conceded, the one sacrifices, the other circumcision; and they became
instead of Gentiles Jews, and instead of these Christians, having by a gradual
change of position been brought near to the gospel. Let Paul persuade you of
this, who from circumcising and being purified was brought to say: 'But as for
me, my brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I continue to be
persecuted?' The one is a matter of the dispensation, the other of perfection» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#812"><SUP>812</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>That God permitted sacrifices in order to lead men to shun idolatry, Moses
also testifies, since in Leviticus he wrote thus, after he had said that those
of Israel were not allowed to perform any kind of sacrifice in another place
besides the tent of witness: «And they shall no longer perform their own
sacrifice to the vanities after whom they themselves go a whoring» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#813"><SUP>813</SUP></A>.
When therefore we say that the enactments which were laid down for that infant
people, who were incapable of rising to the perfect service of God, <A NAME="p304"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|304</SPAN></A>
that I mean which is performed through the spirit, when the perfection came,
which is Christ, were in the bodily form done away, we do not sin <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#814"><SUP>814</SUP></A>.
Let me, as if dealing with a hypothesis <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#815"><SUP>815</SUP></A>, test the matter. Various
animals were formerly sacrificed for sin, and the blood of these was brought
into the sanctuary by the high-priest, while, their bodies were delivered to be
burnt outside the camp. This kind of sacrifices therefore symbolized beforehand
the great sacrifice which balances the great sin of the world, as Paul also
says: «For, as for the animals whose blood was brought into the sanctuary
because of sins by the high-priest, the bodies of these were burnt outside the
camp. Therefore Jesus also, in order to sanctify the people by his own blood,
suffered outside the gate» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#816"><SUP>816</SUP></A>. Since then Christ the Saviour of all
was sacrificed in the original model on the cross, and is also slaughtered so to
speak every day on the altar, and is distributed to the believers limb by limb
by the hand of the priests, who is so mad, and so exceedingly uninstructed in
the greatest matters, as to dare to deny that the type was abolished in the
letter, that is according to the bodily form, and the <A NAME="p305"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|305</SPAN></A>
sacrifice of animals ceased, but the intellectual meaning <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#817"><SUP>817</SUP></A>
was
also preserved according to the spirit, in which the truth was prefigured
through it? After the same manner also the eating of unleavened bread was
abolished according to the letter, but according to the spirit it is still
maintained, in that we 'keep the feast not in the leaven of wickedness and
bitterness, but in the unleavened bread of purity and truth' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#818"><SUP>818</SUP></A>. <i>(A
little farther on). </i>But we will grant if you wish that the wax represents
the letter, and the bronze that has been melted is the perfection in the spirit.
If then it is the fact that, when the bronze is brought to the fire, it is
reduced to non-existence, and the wax, when liquefied, gives to the bronze the
shape only of that which was fashioned, explain if you have any abundant store
of wisdom. But, if the wax has been dissolved and liquefied, the letter will be
dissolved, but the spiritual meaning <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#819"><SUP>819</SUP></A> of the law will remain,
preserving the form <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#820"><SUP>820</SUP></A> of the letter. or Cyril teaches and says: «We
have not relegated the types to utter desolation(?), though certainly to partial
desolation, I mean since the letter of the bodily observances ceases» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#821"><SUP>821</SUP></A>.
Listen to the expressions of Gregory <A NAME="p306"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|306</SPAN></A>
the Theologian <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#822"><SUP>822</SUP></A>, and let the words of that man and his thoughts be
a law to you, and a fixed ordinance, since they are indeed such to all
Christians. When in the homily on the Passover he discussed the meaning <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#823"><SUP>823</SUP></A>
of all the rites performed at the old Passover, he also caused the hearer to
pass from the letter to the spirit: for, when he came to the staff, and solved
the riddle of this, he commanded the man who eats this our Passover in truth to
lean upon the staff of faith, using these words: «Stand firmly, with feet
strongly planted, being in no point shaken by the adversaries, nor carried away
by words of plausibility. These things Christ fulfilled, the subverter of the
letter, the fulfiller of the spirit» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#824"><SUP>824</SUP></A>. If 'the letter killeth, but
the spirit giveth life' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#825"><SUP>825</SUP></A>, and Christ is life as it is written, «When
Christ our life shall be revealed» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#826"><SUP>826</SUP></A>, how can it be that when the
life came that which slew was not abolished? since, if you deny that the law was
abolished in the letter, but brought to confirmation in the spirit, Paul also
will be seen to say contradictory things, writing in one place that he 'annulled
the law of commandments in teachings' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#827"><SUP>827</SUP></A>, and saying in another, «Do
we therefore annul the law through faith? For be it. Nay we establish the law» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#828"><SUP>828</SUP></A>,
recognising the <A NAME="p307"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|307</SPAN></A> commandment as 'holy and just and good'
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#829"><SUP>829</SUP></A>, and in another
sorrowfully crying to those who chose after recognition of the truth to live by
the law, «Ye who are justified in the law have been annulled from Christ, ye
have fallen from grace» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#830"><SUP>830</SUP></A>. It is a thing impossible that of the same
object he should say that it has been annulled and openly confess that it has
been established, and that he should admire it as just and good, while he
rejects those who are justified in this and asserts that they have fallen from
the grace that is in Christ. For it seems to some extent likely that we [shall remove] the enigma..... from doubt if we look carefully at the words
of Gregory the Theologian <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#831"><SUP>831</SUP></A>; for he called Christ 'the subverter of
the letter, but the fulfiller of the spirit'. Let us therefore cleave to the law
inasmuch as it has been fulfilled, but let us neglect it, let us make haste to
eradicate it with the swift foot of the word inasmuch as it has been abolished,
rightly treating its bodily observances with contempt. Nay, you say, but that
holy man says that the letter was abolished, while you say the law, inasmuch as
you said that Paul is a subverter of the law. Rather ..... from what we have
said you have the certain truth which <A NAME="p308"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|308</SPAN></A>
was before likely. When Paul says that the law of commandments was annulled,
we say that he means that according to the letter it was annulled, trusting to
the words of Gregory; and there is therefore nothing that prevents me also from
calling the letter the law. However <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#832"><SUP>832</SUP></A>, if you desire to hear one of
the fathers saying that the law was abolished when he should have said the
letter, we will readily produce this citation also for you.

the throne <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#836"><SUP>836</SUP></A> of <A NAME="p309"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|309</SPAN></A>
the church of Constantinople at that time, said <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#837"><SUP>837</SUP></A>
that the
abomination of desolation is the image which Hadrian, king of the Romans, set up
within the temple, when he encamped against Jerusalem<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#838"><SUP>838</SUP></A>: for it is the
habit of Scripture to say that likenesses made with hands, and the graven
statues of the demon-worship of the heathen, are an abomination, as Manasseh
says in the song that he set up abominations and multiplied pollutions <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#839"><SUP>839</SUP></A>.
For it is better for us to say that the abomination of desolation is Antichrist;
since it is impossible for us to interpret all the expressions contained in the
gospel in the same passage like a record of Scripture <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#840"><SUP>840</SUP></A>
history. Of
him the apostle also in writing to the Thessalonians said, «In order that the
man of sin may be revealed, the son of perdition, who is opposed to and exalteth
himself against everyone that is called God or is an object of worship, so that
he sits in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#841"><SUP>841</SUP></A>: for
the temple at Jerusalem is termed a ' holy place'. For it is possible for the
same words of the gospel to be taken both in a historical sense as referring to
the desolation and devastation of Jerusalem, and in a sublime sense to the
complete <A NAME="p310"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|310</SPAN></A> desolation and end of the world. But for your assurance I have thought it to
be necessary for us to cite also the words of the interpretation of the man whom
we have mentioned, the holy John, which are these: a But he said that the image
of him who came at that time, who also devastated the city, and set up the image
within the temple, is an abomination; wherefore also he called it a desolation»

<p>[519-38.] You ask why our Lord and God Jesus Christ took Peter and the sons
of Zebedee, James that is and John, apart from the other apostles and disciples,
and this when he raised the daughter of the president of the synagogue who was
dead, and again when he took them up with him into the mountain, and as the text
of the gospel says ' was transfigured before them, and his face <A NAME="p311"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|311</SPAN></A>
shone like the sun, and his raiment Became bright like the light' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#844"><SUP>844</SUP></A>.
My opinion is that he shows them such honours beyond the others because they had
a more specially acute mind, and one that rose with the height of the Godhead of
him who voluntarily humbled himself for us and condescended to become incarnate
and remained in the same and did not leave his most exalted glory and his divine
height <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#845"><SUP>845</SUP></A>. For Peter after he had confessed him and said, «Thou art
the Christ the Son of the living God», heard the plain words, «Blessed art
thou, Simon Bar Jona, for flesh and blood revealed it not to thee but my Father
which is in heaven» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#846"><SUP>846</SUP></A>. And James and John, as Mark the Evangelist
related, being brothers in the spirit more than in the body, were named by our
Saviour <i>Bnai ragsh, </i>that is 'sons of thunder' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#847"><SUP>847</SUP></A>. The reason for
which they merited such an appellation was that he who proclaimed, «In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#848"><SUP>848</SUP></A>,
loudly thundered the divine utterance from heaven <A NAME="p312"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|312</SPAN></A>
and the gift of the Spirit that in truth came down thence, and stirred the
attention of all nations by reason of the wonder, and tore up from its roots and
as one might say from its foundations every false and human opinion that creeps
upon the earth <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#849"><SUP>849</SUP></A>. For it is manifest that James also was rich in the
same grace as his brother, according to the unerring testimony of him who
honoured them by one comman appellation. But some have said that the reason for
which those three were peculiarly honoured beyond the rest of the disciples was
that they specially loved Jesus, and in the same way he also too loved them,
because of the virtues that were in them, as the very wise John bishop of
Constantinople also said in the 56<sup>th</sup> homily of the Commentary on the
Gospel of Matthew, where he thus interpreted the words concerning them: «Why
did he take these? Because these excelled the others. And Peter showed the
superiority by the fact that he loved him much, and John by the fact that he was
much loved, and James by the answer which he returned saying, 'We can drink the
cup', and not by the answer only, but also by other actions, among them the fact
that he carried out what he said. For he was so troublesome and burdensome to
the Jews that Herod <A NAME="p313"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|313</SPAN></A> thought this would be a great present to give to the Jews if he put him to
death» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#850"><SUP>850</SUP></A>. The words used by our Lord to his disciples, «Greet no
man by the way» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#851"><SUP>851</SUP></A> naturally cause perplexity among those who read the
divine Scriptures superficially: for greeting more especially becomes ministers
of peace and teachers of a humble disposition. But it is not possible for us to
take the actual injunction as bearing this meaning; for our Saviour is thereby
shown to contradict himself and to be making use of injunctions which do not
agree with one another; for Matthew wrote of him that he said to his disciples,
«And, if ye greet your friends only, what special thing do ye? Do not the
tax-gatherers also the same?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#852"><SUP>852</SUP></A>. How then can he who enjoins us to
greet not only those who are friends but also enemies prohibit us from greeting
those who meet us on the way? Accordingly therefore it is manifest that we must
direct the purport of the injunction to another meaning. It is the habit of men
to visit their acquaintances who live at a distance from them, and whom they
have not seen for a long time, making this the occasion <A NAME="p314"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|314</SPAN></A>
of a journey, the greeting of those persons, as Luke wrote of Mary the
God-bearer that the reason for which she went to the hill-country was to greet
Elizabeth, saying thus: «And Mary arose in the same days, and went to the
hill-country in haste, to a city of Judah, and entered the house of Zacharias,
and greeted Elizabeth» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#853"><SUP>853</SUP></A>. Since therefore our Lord and God wished his
disciples to be unencumbered and self-reliant, and that they should be very
zealous for the preaching-journey, he prohibited such greeting, when they were
setting out on the apostolic and divine journey, lest they should give up the
zeal for the journey set before them and enter upon the journey that is called
vain, which leads aside to another path. For he wished the divine service of the
gospel-message and of the saving preaching to be honoured before fitting human
affection and the love that creeps upon the earth. And the approved Cyril also
bishop of Alexandria wrote in agreement with these things in precise words and
at length, in the 62<sup>nd</sup> homily of the Commentary on the Gospel of
Luke: «Again how could it not be incumbent on men who were to enlighten those
that were in darkness and to bring <A NAME="p315"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|315</SPAN></A>
them to the knowledge of the truth above all others to adopt a gentle
demeanour and great affability, and not roughly shun intercourse with them, so
as to refuse even to greet them? though it indeed becomes saints together with
other good qualities to have that also of approaching people in a proper way and
giving greeting. For perhaps it would happen that those who met them were not
under all circumstances unbelievers, but also some of those who shared their
opinions, or of those who had been already enlightened, so that for this reason
it was necessary to give them a message of love, I mean the word ' Hail! '. What
therefore? And for this reason Christ does not give the injunction in order that
they may be misanthropes, nor does he give it in order to show honour to <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#854"><SUP>854</SUP></A>
a refusal to offer greeting, but rather he teaches them to avoid such refusal.
It is not unreasonable for us to understand that, when the disciples were going
round the cities and villages, and propounding the mysteries relating to the
divine doctrines to those in every place, they did not then wish to do this
without distraction, but so to speak at leisure, turning out of the way and
making use of certain diversions, because someone perhaps wished to see a man
whom he knew <A NAME="p316"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|316</SPAN></A> and his friend, and afterwards spend the time proper for teaching in
gluttony, not in urgent things. Accordingly he says that, showing unencumbered
zeal for the divine proclamation, they should be sure not to give attention that
does not profit to friendships (but rather that which pleases God is placed
before every thing), and, while employing acts of courtesy that cannot be
impugned and do not occupy attention, to give close attention to the apostolic
business» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#855"><SUP>855</SUP></A>.

spiritual and suprasensual sublimity, suggests to us that before our Saviour's
coming there was night in this world, for human affairs were devoid of the
knowledge of God, being devoted to the service of gods falsely so-called; but,
when a kind of rising and dawn of light took place, when our Saviour came and
rose and shone upon those on earth, like a 'Sun of righteousness' (this the
divine Scripture says <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#858"><SUP>858</SUP></A>), then the apostolic net was let down, and
made a great catch of men, and for this reason had the right side allotted to
it. For Moses and the prophets, when they let down the fishing-net, during the
past night, caught the people of Israel only, while these often jumped out of
the net and served demons, and the present state is understood to be
the same as if they had not been caught <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#859"><SUP>859</SUP></A>. Wherefore, also they
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#860"><SUP>860</SUP></A> left for the apostles the most honourable place on the right, while they
themselves occupied the left station, which according to our custom is inferior
in honour. But in respect of the fish which were caught the number 100 shows the
great <A NAME="p318"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|318</SPAN></A> multitude from the nations who were caught by the proclamation of the gospel;
and, when Israel did not succeed, the teaching of the gospel seized that which
is perfect;for the number 100 is perfect, being composed of 10 times 10.
Wherefore also our Saviour likened all rational creation to 100 sheep, saying
that 99 <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#861"><SUP>861</SUP></A>............

<p>[514-8.] But the words spoken by our Saviour to the disciples at the
institution of the new and divine mystery, «I will not drink henceforth of this product
of the vine till the day on which I shall drink it with you new in my Father's
kingdom» are explained and interpreted in two ways. John bishop of <A NAME="p319"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|319</SPAN></A>
Constantinople says that the new drinking of the cup is that occasion on
which he drank with his disciples after the Resurrection, thereby
confirming the nature of the body which rose, and eradicating the
profane notion of phantasy; for the holy Peter is related in the
Acts of the Apostles to have said to Cornelius, «Us who ate and
drank with him after he rose from the dead» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#865"><SUP>865</SUP></A>. But Gregory the
Theologian in the homily on the Passover says that the new drinking of the cup
is the revelation of the divine conceptions that shall take place and is
expected in the kingdom of the heavens, when mirrors and riddles are
done away, and the sight face to face is revealed, as the divine apostle says <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#866"><SUP>866</SUP></A>.
But it is fitting that I should quote to you these words of the doctor, the
contents of which are as follows: «We shall receive the Passover, but now
symbolically <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#867"><SUP>867</SUP></A>, and a Passover that is more plainly revealed than the
old one (for I am bold enough to say that the legal Passover was an obscurer
symbol of a symbol); but a little later <A NAME="p320"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|320</SPAN></A>
one thatis more perfect and purer, when the <i>Word </i>shall drink it new
with us in the Father's kingdom, revealing to us and teaching us things that he
has now shown ohscurely; for that which is now made to appear is always new.
But, what the drinking and enjoyment is, it is ours to learn, but his to teach,
and to show the matter to his disciples. For even the teaching is the food of
him who teaches» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#868"><SUP>868</SUP></A>. And very well did the Theologian give expression
to these words; for our Lord also reckons our profit his own food and drink; for
thus also he says in the gospel, «My food is to do my Father's will» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#869"><SUP>869</SUP></A>;
and again, when he was about to speak to the men from Samaria, he said to the
disciples, «1 have food to eat, which ye know not» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#870"><SUP>870</SUP></A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>[519-38.] But, since your saintliness asked with regard to Enoch and Elijah,
of whom one was translated that he should not see death, as the apostle said <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#872"><SUP>872</SUP></A>,
<A NAME="p321"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|321</SPAN></A> while the other was caught up towards heaven, if they will undergo the common
death, it is incumbent upon us to state, in proportion to the small capacity
which we possess, the things that have reached our comprehension from the
teaching of the fathers. It is believed therefore according to the testimonies
of the divine words that Enoch was translated, and Elijah was caught up towards
heaven, and was carried by the air <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#873"><SUP>873</SUP></A>, and that they are alive, and that they are
in such places as God knows, and that he <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#874"><SUP>874</SUP></A> bestowed upon
them such a marvellous translation hence, and that they are in a mortal body,
having not yet received the blessing of immortality. For let us agree with Paul
who says generally of all the holy men who pleased God, «And all these to whom
testimony was borne through faith received not the promises, God having foreseen , some better thing for our sakes. that
they might not be perfected without us» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#875"><SUP>875</SUP></A>. And it is manifest that
perfection <A NAME="p322"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|322</SPAN></A> is nothing else except a state of immortality and glory, and impassibility,
that does not grow old, in the kingdom of heaven. That this is so is confirmed
by John also the wise in the Spirit, who became bishop of Constantinople, in the
22<sup>nd</sup> homily of the commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he
gives the following teaching: «But many inquire whither Enoch was translated,
and why he was translated, and why he did not die, neither he nor. Elijah, and,
if they are still living, how they are living, and in what form. But it is
superfluous for us to inquire into these things. For that the one was translated
and the other was taken up the Scriptures stated; but where they exist or how
they exist they did not go on to say; for they do not say anything beyond what
is necessary» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#876"><SUP>876</SUP></A>. And the same doctor delivered an expository
discourse in Constantinople in the church of Marth Anastasia <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#877"><SUP>877</SUP></A>
about
the saying of the apostle who says, «Henceforth, my brethren, be strong in our
Lord and in the power of his might» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#878"><SUP>878</SUP></A>, and, it being the day of the
actual commemoration of the martyrs, and the king <A NAME="p323"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|323</SPAN></A>
having come to the martyrs' chapel and withdrawn before the sermon, he
delivered a discourse after the king's departure, of which the beginning is: «Blessed
is God for the greatness of the power of the martyrs, for yesterday they drew
the whole city with the queen, and to-day the king with his soldiers, with great
reverence». And, when in this discourse he was explaining about death and the
resurrection, he gave this teaching: «Since therefore the fear had increased
and had shaken the mind, see how thereafter he introduces also the hope
concerning the resurrection, a dark hope indeed and not clear, but still he
introduces it. For Enoch, who came into being after these things, he did not
allow to die; and Paul says that 'by faith Enoch was translated that he might
not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him'. For he
translated him and did not allow him to die. He did not yet make him immortal,
in order that he might not do away the fear, but he remains without dying. And
he is not immortal; but he gave continuance of life in the mortal body, opening
up, as I said, obscurely the hope of the resurrection» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#879"><SUP>879</SUP></A>.

</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>[513-38.] You ask therefore what is the meaning of the divine command which
is contained in the law that was given through Moses and says: «If thou make me
an altar of stones, build them not hewn; for thou hast laid thy hand-tool upon
it, and it is defiled» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#886"><SUP>886</SUP></A>. By 'hand-tool' he designates the
instrument <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#887"><SUP>887</SUP></A> of iron, the ax or hatchet, that is wielded by the
hewers. For he reckons an altar fashioned of hewn stones to be abominable and
does not <A NAME="p327"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|327</SPAN></A> accept it as being a defiled thing. But the symbol teaches that fruits that
spring by nature itself from the earth are more pleasing to God, which shall be
offered to God upon the altar rather than those that are gained by the rapine
and violence of war, which are the acquisition of iron.
</p>
<p><i>(And again.) </i>But the symbol of the law introduces to us also another
thought which is akin to this and edifying. 'The altar that was built of chance
stones naturally produced by the earth establishes the fact that God is pleased <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#888"><SUP>888</SUP></A>
by the simple impulses and natural thoughts that are in our soul, not by
thoughts that are decked out by artificial preparation and manifold devices,
and, as if hewn out, mingle with the truth and the simplicity arising from this.
<i>(And again from the same.) </i>For as the holy Cyril interprets in the 9<sup>th</sup>
book about worship in spirit, «He names Emmanuel an earth-altar. For 'the Word
became flesh'. For the nature of flesh is earth and <A NAME="p328"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|328</SPAN></A>
from earth» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#889"><SUP>889</SUP></A>. «But, if thou make me an altar of stones, build
them not hewn». He does not allow words offered to God to be cut with iron. For
Christ was 'the elect stone of the head of the corner and precious', <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#890"><SUP>890</SUP></A>
incapable of being cut by sin, because he knew not how to be injured by the
devil's strokes; and he was not divided between God and the world, though he
became flesh, but he is all holy. Accordingly the altar made of earth, and the
stones also that are not smitten by iron, signify Christ, as in the
illustrations mentioned above.&nbsp;

<p>[519-38.] But the next point to which I will apply myself is the words found
in the Book of Genesis that were spoken by God, when he was about to bring <A NAME="p329"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|329</SPAN></A>
the flood in the days of Noah, «My spirit shall not dwell among those men
forever, because they are flesh; but their days shall be 120 years» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#891"><SUP>891</SUP></A>.
You ask how it is that, when a space of 120 years had been granted, he is seen
to have carried out the same threat after 100 years, and flooded the whole earth
together. For Noah was 500 years old on the day on which he granted him the
space; and the divine Scripture said, «And the waters of the flood came upon
the earth in the 600<sup>th</sup> year of the life of Noah, in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month on the 27<sup>th</sup> day of the month» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#892"><SUP>892</SUP></A>. Upon this, being
directed to the truth by the divine Scripture itself, we say that the term of
120 years was given in mercifulness, in order that those who were living an evil
life might change for the better in fear of the threat. But they came to the
utmost limit of wickedness, and treated the divine long-suffering with contempt,
and accordingly God brought the punishment immediately; not as if he did not
know what was to happen, but to show by the long term the abundance of his own
long-suffering, and to establish also the greatness of those men's wickedness,
who so much increased their impiety, and went down to the very end and bottom of
wickedness, so as to call the sentence quickly down upon them. <A NAME="p330"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|330</SPAN></A>
Therefore he further also said to the righteous Noah, «The end of all flesh
hath come in before me, because the earth hath been filled with iniquity by them»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#893"><SUP>893</SUP></A>. For it is his custom to change his own sentences in the direction
of fury and goodness according to our change, either towards wickedness or
towards virtue. And this he stated plainly through Jeremiah the prophet: «If I
speak a determination against a people or against a kingdom to root it out and
destroy it, and that people turn from their evil deeds, I will repent concerning
the evil things which I spake to do to them. And, if I speak a determination
against a people and against a kingdom, that it be built and planted, and they
do evil deeds before me, and hearken not to my voice, I will repent concerning
the good things which I spake to do to them» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#894"><SUP>894</SUP></A>. And that these
things are so is laid down by the very wise John also who became bishop of
Constantinople, when he is interpreting the 104<sup>th</sup> Psalm and writing
thus, and contending as against the Jews, who adduced the promises to their
fathers: «But, if the Jew argues against these things, and holds to the promise
that was made to them, I learn that many such promises were indeed made in the
Old Testament also. He promised to give the land <A NAME="p331"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|331</SPAN></A>
from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, and did not give it. He promised
Adam to lay the fear and dread of him upon the animals, and the promise was not
brought to completion. He promised that the life of men should be 120 years, and
he brought the punishment before the term. And in the opposite cases the same
things are to be seen. He threatened Hezekiah with death, and turned it away. He
threatened the Ninevites with overthrow, and dispelled the wrath, showing that
neither good things nor painful things depend on him only, but also on the
recipients. For, if he threaten something grievous, and those who receive the
threat change, they repel the wrath from them. But, if he promise something
good, and they show themselves to be unworthy, they will be deprived. Therefore
he says, ' I will speak a determination against a people and against a kingdom,
to build and to plant', but, 'if he says 'they are seen to be unworthy, I will
not bring these things'. Let them not therefore bring God's promises before us,
but let them show if they were seen to be worthy of these. But they cannot show
it: therefore they passed to others. For we nowhere find that they are able to
show that the words 'In thy seed shall all the nations be blessed' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#895"><SUP>895</SUP></A>
'were fulfilled of them» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#896"><SUP>896</SUP></A><i>. </i>It is the same difficulty and
elucidation <A NAME="p332"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|332</SPAN></A> to which the words' also relate which the holy Cyril wrote in the 12<sup>th</sup>
book of the commentary on the Gospel of John, as follows: «But, because <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#897"><SUP>897</SUP></A>,
though he often promised to do many things at the fitting time, he nevertheless
did them even before the time appointed, for the purpose of persuading us, in
order that we may truly believe that even under all circumstances the things
said by him will come to effect, we will show from the following. He promised to
raise the dead, and to bring back to life those who are laid in the earth and
dust. For, 'there cometh', he saith, 'an hour, wherein the dead shall hear the
voice of the Son of man and come forth, they that have done good deeds to the
resurrection of life, but they that have done evil deeds to the resurrection of
judgment'. And that he will easily make this good, and will hasten to persuade <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#898"><SUP>898</SUP></A>
he taught by saying, ' I am the resurrection and the life'. And, because he
would not make the greatness of the thing that the dead should rise at that time
so to speak incredible, for a useful purpose the time of the resurrection is
hastened <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#899"><SUP>899</SUP></A> and he shows the sign in that he raised Lazarus and the
widow's son, and Jairus' daughter. And what else besides these things? He says
that the resurrection of the <A NAME="p333"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|333</SPAN></A> saints shall be something exceedingly glorious. 'Then', he says, 'the
righteous shall shine in their Father's kingdom', that he may again be believed
as one who speaks truly, in that he saw the disciples beforehand and gave the
sight of this <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#900"><SUP>900</SUP></A>. For 'he took Peter and James and John, and went up into a
mountain, and was transfigured before them; and his face shone as lightning, and
his raiment became white as snow'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#901"><SUP>901</SUP></A>. But in the above-mentioned
commentary on the 104<sup>th</sup> Psalm we find the holy John bishop of
Constantinople solving the point in Exodus that seemed doubtful; and the point
that seemed doubtful is, you said, as follows: «How is it that, after Moses had
turned all the water in Egypt into blood, Scripture said that the magicians were
able to show the same sign against that? For, since all the water had been
changed, how was it possible for pure water to be found in which these men were
to show the sign?» Some have said that it was possible for sea-water to come,
since the sea was not at a great distance, in order that they might change this
by magic skill; while others have said that it is not incredible that Moses
himself, after the change to blood, turned <A NAME="p334"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|334</SPAN></A>
the water back to its own appearance and nature, in order that the magicians
might show their own skill on the other side. But the wise doctor John, since he
understood the divine power as is right and in very discerning<sup>1 </sup>fashion,
said that, as in the case of the darkness the Egyptians had that darkness, while
the sons of Israel had light, and, as in the matter of the herds, and in the
case of the yoke-animals when they died, those belonging to the Israelites
remained unharmed, and, in the case of the plague of hail, where the sons of
Israel were in the land of Goshen no hail fell, in the same way you should
understand as regards all the plagues too, among which that change from water to
blood was also included, and it must be believed that in the land of Goshen, and
where the sons of Israel were, the water remained for the sons of Israel in its
own nature without change, in which it was possible for the magicians to show
the performances of their own skill. Among the words uttered by the doctor is
contained the following passage by way of summary: «' He sent darkness and made
it dark' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#902"><SUP>902</SUP></A>; and it was a very glorious fact that, while the ray shone
everywhere, in, Egypt darkness appeared; and there not throughout, but only
where the Egyptians were. For, lest any one should say that what happened was an
eclipse <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#903"><SUP>903</SUP></A>, <A NAME="p335"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|335</SPAN></A>
that is a disappearance of the moon, nor <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#904"><SUP>904</SUP></A> the course of nature,
the Hebrews who were living in the same country with them were not affected by
this plague, a thing which happened in the other plagues». After a similar
manner Gregory also bishop of Nyssa, who was great in the knowledge of divine
things, in the treatise which he composed about virtue said these things: he
said: «For then all the nature of the waters in Egypt was in accordance with
Moses' command turned to blood, and the fish were destroyed, because the water
was converted to fleshlike density; but the Hebrews, when they drew the blood,
had water <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#905"><SUP>905</SUP></A>. Therefore there arose an occasion for the display of
skill, that with the water found among the Hebrews they might in a defective
manner contrive to produce the appearance of blood» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#906"><SUP>906</SUP></A>. The words
used in the 1<sup>st</sup> Book of Kingdoms to Ahimelech the priest by the holy
David, «Is the journey itself also profane? <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#907"><SUP>907</SUP></A> because it will be
hallowed to-day by means of my implements», if it is very carefully and clearly
read, is seen to be much plainer than the sun, and to be free from all
obscurity. David asked for bread to eat; and the priest answered and said, «There
are no profane loaves under my hands; but there are holy <A NAME="p336"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|336</SPAN></A>
loaves. If the slaves have refrained, at least from a woman, they shall eat».
And David answered and said, «But we have kept away from a woman since
yesterday, and since the third day. Since I set out on the journey,<sub> </sub>all
the slaves have been pure». And, these things having been so stated first, what
follows should be read as a question, «Is the journey itself also profane?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#908"><SUP>908</SUP></A>;
and thereupon the addition will give the reason for which the journey is not
profane; and the addition runs, «Because it will be hallowed to-day by means of
my implements», that is to say, 'Will anyone call the same journey a profane
thing, a journey which has been hallowed by means of my implements?', viz 'by
means of my armour, and the burden of my implements, and by my going to war'.
And from this it is manifest that, inasmuch as the slaves were accustomed to
carry his implements and arms, when he went out to war, they were purified. And,
that slaves again used to march after generals or commanders, as armour-bearers,
this is manifest from many instances; for the present from the end of the I<sup>st</sup>
Book <A NAME="p337"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|337</SPAN></A> of Kingdoms, in which it is stated that Saul said to his weapon-carrier, «Draw
thy sword and transfix me with it» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#909"><SUP>909</SUP></A>. And towards the end of the 2nd<sup>
</sup>book he says, in the numeration and reckoning of the generals or
commanders of the divine David. «Naharai the Berothite, weapon-carrier of Joab the son
of Zeruiah» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#910"><SUP>910</SUP></A>. This then is what David here said, «Even the slaves
themselves are pure, because they are weaponbearers»; and this now when he had
fled from Saul, and was not carrying arms. Wherefore also he asked the priest
saying, «See if there be here under thine hand a spear or a sword, because I
did not take my sword and my weapons in mine hand, because the king's word was
pressing» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#911"><SUP>911</SUP></A>. And from what is here stated especially it is manifest
that those who went out for the purpose of being ranged in order of battle were
purified. And this is very clearly recognised also from the commandments given
in Deuteronomy; for he says: «If thou go out against thine enemies, keep
thyself from every evil action. And, if there be among thee a man who is not
pure from his discharge at night, he shall go outside the camp and shall not'
come into the camp. And it shall be that towards evening he shall bathe his body
in water, and, <A NAME="p338"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|338</SPAN></A> when the sun hath set, he shall go into the camp. And thou shalt have a place
outside the camp, and he shall go out there without. And thou shall have a peg
on thy loins, and it shalt be that, when thou sittest outside, thou shalt dig
with it, and shalt turn and hide thy shame with it; because the Lord thy God
walketh in thy camp, to rescue thee, and to deliver thine enemies into thine
hands; and thy camp shall be holy; and the shame of an act shall not be seen in
thee and shall turn away from thee» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#912"><SUP>912</SUP></A>. And in the 2<sup>nd </sup>Book
of Kingdoms Uriah too also manifests this same sentiment. When he had returned
from the lines, and was about to go to them, David ordered him to go down to his
own house after supper; and he answered and said, «If the ark and Israel and
Judah dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and my lord's bondmen are encamped upon
the face of the field, shall even I go into mine house and eat and drink and
sleep with my wife? how? As my soul liveth, I will not do this thing» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#913"><SUP>913</SUP></A>.

<p>[513-8.] For you write to the effect that certain men said about the holy
John the Evangelist that he did not undergo the common end, but still continues
even now to exist without death, like Enoch, of whom the apostle said that he
'was translated that he might not see death' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#918"><SUP>918</SUP></A>, and Elijah of whom it
is written that he 'was carried up in a whirlwind toward heaven' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#919"><SUP>919</SUP></A>. I
am astonished at the crassness of the ignorance of those who said this and their
lack of information. As the evangelist manifestly corrects the supposition of
many and says, «Jesus did not say to him 'He shall not die', but 'If I will
that he tarry till I come what is it to thee?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#920"><SUP>920</SUP></A>, where is there room
for us to speak in opposition to the divine Scriptures and say that he who said
these things remained immortal? The disciples above all, they who were the
preachers of the resurrection, were bound to undergo the common <A NAME="p341"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|341</SPAN></A>
end, in order that all who received the preaching of the gospel might learn
that all the chances of their blessedness rest in the future life, and that we
must despise the life here, and willingly hasten to death. Such wonderful things
were done in the times of the old covenant, when men were not yet in
a perfect condition, and were deficient in faith, and were unable to receive the
teaching of the resurrection, and firmly to believe that, after the separation
of soul and body, it is possible for those who have once died to come back again
to life. As to the fact that John the Evangelist underwent the common end, it is
not we only who admit this, but men also who are highly distinguished among the
fathers, and guides to the mysteries and doctors of the
holy church. And John, who became bishop of Constantinople, in the commentary on
the Gospel of John, when commenting on the very place from which those who are
blind towards what is manifest and plain draw the erroneous inference, says
thus: «For, because Peter was always confident and forward in asking such
questions, it was again by way of cutting away his impetuosity and teaching him
not to make any further inquiry that he said this. Therefore the report went out
among <A NAME="p342"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|342</SPAN></A> the brethren that that man should not die. And he did not say, 'He shall
tarry till I come', but, 'If I will that he tarry'. 'For do not suppose either',
he says, 'that I manage your affairs in one way only'. But this he did because
he wished to detach them from excessive love towards one another. For, since
they were to receive the charge of the world, it was not right for them any
longer to be bound up with one another: for, if this had been so, this would
have been a great loss to the world. Therefore he says thus': 'You have had a
work entrusted to you, look to it, and act and fight like a combatant. For what
even though I will that he tarry here? look you to your own affairs, and concern
yourself about them'. But do you observe, I pray, even here also the unassuming
character of the evangelist. For after mentioning the belief of the disciples
with regard to this matter he corrects it on the ground that they had not
noticed what he said. For neither did Jesus say, ' He shall not die', but, 'If
will that he tarry'<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#921"><SUP>921</SUP></A>. And the very wise Cyril, while inserting a
mention of the interpretation of this saying, writes thus: «When Peter
therefore saw this man, he tried to be curious, and begged to learn to what and
what kind of <A NAME="p343"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|343</SPAN></A> dangers he also would after these things be exposed, or to what the end of his
life also would come. But the question was manifestly beyond the limits of due
reason, and that act was one of inquisitiveness rather; not of useful learning,
that, having obtained knowledge about himself, he should inquire into the things
that were coming upon others. For this reason, as I think, the Lord answered and
said something, though not a direct answer to, the things asked or inquired
about, but he turns in a way the purpose of the questioner to other things, so
that he does not say 'John shall be immortal' but 'If I will that he be alive
till I come, what then is it to you yourself?': 'therefore', that is, 'you have
heard, O Peter, the things that concern you, and why are you curious about
things that concern others? and why do you probe into the knowledge of the
divine judgments out of season? For, if he had actually said that he should
never die <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#922"><SUP>922</SUP></A>, how then will this comfort your anxiety?'»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#923"><SUP>923</SUP></A>
And Athanasius patriarch of Alexandria in the 41<sup>st</sup> exposition spoken
at a festival on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of the month of Farmenothi said these words:
«And the graves of all these exist to this day, and we have ourselves seen
them, as that of Peter and that of Paul at the great Rome, <A NAME="p344"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|344</SPAN></A>
and that of John at Ephesus» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#924"><SUP>924</SUP></A>. And Eusebius Pamphili in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
book of the Ecclesiastical History plainly wrote that John the
theologian-apostle and evangelist underwent the common end of all men, and that
he awaits the true and long life that has no ending which is after the
resurrection: and in the 68<sup>th</sup> chapter of the book which
we have mentioned he says; «It is related that John, the apostle and evangelist
at the same time, was still living in the world, and on account of the testimony
concerning God the Word was condemned to live in the island of
Patmos»; and again in the 23<sup>rd</sup> chapter he writes thus:
«In these times there had been left in the world in Asia the actual man whom
Jesus loved, John the apostle and evangelist at the same time, and he was
governing the churches there, having returned from the island in which he had
been exiled after Domitian's death»; and in the 31<sup>st</sup> chapter
he immediately adds these things about him: «But the chronology of John's life
we have already mentioned, but the locality of his body is shown from the letter
of Polycrates (he was bishop of the region of Ephesus), in writing
which to Victor bishop of the Romans <A NAME="p345"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|345</SPAN></A>
he mentions him and Philip the apostle at the same time and the latter's
daughters as follows: 'In Asia also sleep great lights who shall rise at the
last day of our Lord's coming, in which he comes with glory from heaven and
shall search out all the saints, Philip who was of the 12 apostles, who also
sleeps in Hierapolis, and his two daughters who had grown old in virginity; and
his other daughter, who lived her life in the Holy Spirit, fell asleep in
Ephesus. Moreover John also as well who fell upon our Lord's breast, who became
a priest, having put on the crown, and martyr <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#925"><SUP>925</SUP></A> and doctor, he sleeps
in Ephesus'. So much we have said concerning these persons' death» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#926"><SUP>926</SUP></A>.
But that other argument also besides is one of great madness and of uninstructed
understanding, which confirms the erroneous supposition from the gospel saying
which was spoken by our God and Saviour Jesus Christ to his disciples in this
way: «Verily I say unto you; there are some standing here who shall not taste
death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#927"><SUP>927</SUP></A>. It is
time for those who thus err to say also of which of the other disciples they
suppose that together with John himself they did not taste of death, but that
they have remained immortal to this day; for the <A NAME="p346"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|346</SPAN></A>
saying is expressed in the plural, for Christ did not say 'someone who shall
not taste death till he see the Son of man coming in his kingdom'. What answer
will the men who speak all their words without examination give to this? It was
not in reference to immortality in this world that our Saviour himself spoke
these things to his own disciples, but because he wished to supply confirmation
in the matter of the promise of the future life, and of the glory that is in it;
for in fact a little before he said, «The Son of man shall come in the glory of
his Father with his angels, and then shall he reward every man according to his
works»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#928"><SUP>928</SUP></A>. It was because he wished, as I have said, to raise their
mind which still saw little and was confined to the lowliness of the
dispensation and had no God-befitting thoughts to the height of that hope that
he immediately added the saying, «Verily I say unto you that there are some
standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of man coming in
his kingdom», and because he was about to take the three disciples, Peter,
James, and John, up into the mountain, and to show them a phantasm
and very obscure picture of the future kingdom and of his own glory, and as on a
stage give to that which was immediately <A NAME="p347"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|347</SPAN></A>
duly to appear the future exalted and God-befitting greatness which our mind
cannot grasp. For after these words in immediate sequence the evangelist added,
«After six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and led them
up into a high mountain alone and was transfigured before them, and his face
shone like the sun, and his raiment became white like the light» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#929"><SUP>929</SUP></A>.
Let no one again from the statement that the Son of man shall come in his
kingdom refer the saying to the second coming of our Saviour; for the name
'coming' may be used not only to signify a bodily coming, but also for the glory
and light of the divine revelation. This is shown by the divine saying of our
Saviour when he says in the Gospel of John to his disciples, «If a man loveth
me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him,
and make an abode with him» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#930"><SUP>930</SUP></A>. Here the expression 'we will
come'manifestly denotes not a bodily coming, but a revelation as we have said of
God-befitting glory and brightness. <A NAME="p348"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|348</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

knee bow of those in heaven and of those on earth, and of those under the
earth', he does not say this as assigning knees and bones to angels (away with
the thought!), but he wishes to signify the intense worship through the form
that it takes among us. So here also he uses the term 'tongue', not as <A NAME="p349"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|349</SPAN></A>

<p>[508-11(?)] But perhaps someone will say in question, «How are we to
understand that the words which God spoke were uttered?&quot; (meaning words
such as those that were addressed to Adam, «Where art thou, Adam?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#934"><SUP>934</SUP></A>,
and those to Moses on the mountain at the giving of the law, and on the banks of
Jordan, when Christ was baptized with the dispensatory baptism which saves us,
and again when his appearance was changed on the mountain, when Peter and James
and John were with him); for lo! we see that they are words of a saying that was
uttered through the articulation, and it is written that they were heard by
human ears, and it plainly cried by the Jordan and on the mountain, «This is my
beloved Son in whom I am well pleased» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#935"><SUP>935</SUP></A>. We should therefore know,
both in these cases and in all similar ones, that we ought not to fall from the
supposition that befits God, and say that God emits <A NAME="p350"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|350</SPAN></A>
the sound of the composition of words made through the lips and with the
tongue, but be assured, and that very wisely and confidently, that, by the
divine operation and by the power that makes all things that exist, the filling
word was brought into being. This the holy Cyril teaches and confirms in the
work which he addressed to Theodosius: «For the Jews said that they knew that
God spoke with Moses <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#936"><SUP>936</SUP></A>. For perhaps they did not know by reason of
great stupidity that no one has ever heard the nature that is above all things
speaking in a manner befitting men, but the words that are addressed to men are
brought into being in a manner which he knows, for it is not possible for us to
say. For what work will God fail from weakness to perform? For what will he not
bring to pass if he wishes, and that very easily?» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#937"><SUP>937</SUP></A>
</p>
<p>When also it is written that the words of God were brought to one of the
saints through a mediating angel, according to the same reverent principle let
us say that the words that were emitted by the mediation of an angel were
brought into being through divine inspiration and so to speak by operation. And
this Athanasius teaches in the 3<sup>rd</sup> treatise on the Trinity <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#938"><SUP>938</SUP></A>.

<p>[514-7.] After we had held the love of God that is in you much to blame for
sending the religious bishops Epiphanius and Symbatius <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#940"><SUP>940</SUP></A>, who are
under your authority by right of the metropolitan dignity, without a letter, the
well-tried Basil arrived, bringing us a letter written by you, and, after gladly
seeing this, we believed it to be a defence to the same charge, since we
perceived that by means of it the reason for which the bishops came to the city
of Antiochus is made clear. And the contents of the letter were concerned with
other matters: for among these there was a query concerning a certain scriptural
problem; and it seemed to me difficult and evidence of great ignorance for us to
return an answer to the question while I am distressed in my soul on account of
the division in the faith which has prevailed among you because of our sins. For
we remember one of those wise in divine <A NAME="p352"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|352</SPAN></A>
things who says, «Instruments of music at a time of mourning are a tale out
of season» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#941"><SUP>941</SUP></A>. However, since by the other letter
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#942"><SUP>942</SUP></A> we were
released so to speak from the mourning of sorrow, I considered it right on
account of the great honour maintained towards your excellence to write a few
words in answer to that query, such as have come into my mind, and words which
are drawn from the Scriptures composed by the Spirit and the fathers who with
the help of the Spirit expounded these, little as we have understood. Since you
have set. down in your letter (therein acting rightly) the points raised by
every kind of understanding or by impulsive eloquence, I have determined not to
extend this letter to a great length; for I myself also have believed that the
enjoyment of the good things that are promised us in the kingdom of heaven is
not sensual, nor yet does it consist in eating and drinking. Since the man who
propounds the contrary argument is vehement, and everywhere introduces the
restoration to the primitive state and the enjoyment in Paradise, I pass over
the theory which raises the enjoyment and the trees and the ends of the branches
to an allegory <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#943"><SUP>943</SUP></A>, and come to a matter which is free from dispute, and
simple, and one which draws its defence <A NAME="p353"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|353</SPAN></A>
from the truth only. That Christ by means of his Incarnation raised or raises
us to these primitive conditions is certain. But this must be understood as far
as concerns in corruption arid the abolition of death, to which the bitter taste
enjoyed by disobedience gave birth. That Emmanuel invites us to prizes and
crowns that surpass the primitive state, making our right actions means of
support for further assistance, and that he does not raise us to Paradise again,
but introduces us in a new fashion into the kingdom of heaven, is manifest and
is never a matter of doubt, not even to those who are very perverse. And, in
order that we may not be thought to be rousing the hearer to maintain the
contrary argument by using our own inventions, we will as a superfluity cite the
laws of the God-clad guides to the mysteries <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#944"><SUP>944</SUP></A>
</sup>of the
church, which suffice to bring before our eyes the meaning of the divine words.
Gregory the Theologian in the homily on the divine Epiphany in speaking about
the Incarnation wrote thus: «This is more godlike than the former. This to
those who have intelligence is higher» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#945"><SUP>945</SUP></A>. But, if there is more
likeness to God, and it is higher than a new creation, it is manifest that it
leads those who are formed anew to a higher and more divine <A NAME="p354"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|354</SPAN></A>
condition. And John the holy bishop of Constantinople in the homily
entitled 'Why that tree was called the tree of good and evil', and 'What is the
meaning of the words «To-day thou shalt be with me in Paradise» ', laying down
clear teaching on this matter, said these words: «The robber entered Paradise.
And what is this? Are these the good things which God promises us? Do you not
hear Paul saying, ' These good things eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard,
and they have not gone up into man's heart'. But Paradise both eye has seen,
that of Adam, and ear has heard, and man's heart has received, for indeed we
have been speaking about it for so many days. How then did that robber receive
them? For God does not promise to bring us into Paradise, but into heaven
itself; and he did not proclaim a kingdom of Paradise but a kingdom of heaven.
For 'he began to proclaim and to say, «Repent, for the kingdom of heaven hath
drawn near»&quot;<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#946"><SUP>946</SUP></A>. Since these things therefore have been thus
stated by the holy doctors, it is good to add Paul's words as a head and
confirmation to what has been stated; for he <A NAME="p355"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|355</SPAN></A>
said, «The kingdom of heaven is not food and drink, but righteousness and
peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#947"><SUP>947</SUP></A>. For the saying, «Blessed are
the lowly, for they shall inherit the earth»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#948"><SUP>948</SUP></A>, must on no account
lead us to the notion that after release from this world and the future life we
shall enjoy sensual things. For even the holy John also whom I mentioned a short
time ago stated how Christ, following the custom of the Old Testamen,
which promises a land of promise flowing with milk and honey, himself also
similarly promised to the lowly after this model abundance of days in this
world, and a share in the good things of the earth, writing thus in the
commentary on the Gospel of Matthew: «For he does not incite from future good
things only, but also from present ones, and that on account of the more dense
among the hearers, who seek these things before those that are future»; and a
little farther on: «And in another way also, because in the Old Testament the
prophet says, 'For the lowly shall inherit the earth', he therefore weaves the
sentence together out of words that had grown up with them, in order that they
may not everywhere hear strange things» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#949"><SUP>949</SUP></A>. And the saintly Gregory
bishop of Nyssa in the work entitled 'About the <A NAME="p356"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|356</SPAN></A>
Beatitudes' said thus: «But, if we soar in language and stand above the arch
of heaven, we shall find there the supracelestial earth also, which is kept as
an inheritance for those who have lived in virtue, so that the order of sequence
of the blessings may not seem to be at fault, in that heaven was first set
before us by God and afterwards a promise of earth» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#950"><SUP>950</SUP></A>. But, if any
man, having regard to his belly and occupying himself with foods that please the
throat, turn against these things also, saying, «Why therefore shall we make
use of the earth?», then we must say to him; If we look for a new heaven and a
new earth according to his promise, as the divine Scripture said <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#951"><SUP>951</SUP></A>,
how is it anything but inconceivable that we should introduce the old custom
into the renovation of the elements? When the earth is new, the life also as
well: will assuredly be new, a life that on every point lies outside this one
and differs from it; for we may hear the Psalmist saying, , «The voice of
praise and salvation is in the tent of the righteous» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#952"><SUP>952</SUP></A>. And this a
man will say is the food of those who are about to live the expected life,
continual songs of praise and the sublime contemplation&nbsp; on which the
angels also feed, and joy and inexplicable exaltation, in life that does not <A NAME="p357"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|357</SPAN></A>
end. For those whose throat gapes for sensual enjoyment, being involved in
the same empty-mindedness as those men, make use of senseless fatuities and say,
«For what purpose then shall we make use of teeth, or the other members by
which the perception of the things that please is received?» To these it is obvious to answer that, since the soul receives the body in
perfection at the time of the resurrection, those who rise not being devoid of
genital members, and this though the book of the gospel cries, «In the resurrection they marry not, nor are given in marriage, but they are as the
angels that are in heaven»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#953"><SUP>953</SUP></A>, after the same fashion they will have
also <A NAME="p358"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|358</SPAN></A> teeth and all the members of the body, that, as they have together with the
soul practised habits of virtue, they may also partake of the glory; for it is
not in order that they may make use of these according to the ancient custom. If
we crave for and need sensual food in the future painless life, it is then time
to desire also clothes made of wool, and the other things which this life shows
to be necessary, in the summer and in the winter which comes round in the
succession of the other seasons. But it is very certain that the expected life
is free from all these things, since the seven days' circle which makes up the
existing time ceases, and there is one day the eighth <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#954"><SUP>954</SUP></A>, one which has
none to succeed it and is without evening. If then there is a new heaven and a
new earth and a new course of time expressed in one endless day and not divided
into days and nights, how is it anything but reasonable to expect that the new
life which is unknown to us and is not <A NAME="p359"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|359</SPAN></A>
even comprehended by the mind is severed from sensual foods, just as the life
of the angels is far removed in comparison with the present life of men? But I
for my part say this also, that, since Christ became a beginning for us in all
things, it is manifest that the conditions of our resurrection also bear a
resemblance to the same beginning. If then Christ after the Resurrection from
the place of the dead is <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#955"><SUP>955</SUP></A> made known in flesh as it is written
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#956"><SUP>956</SUP></A>,
having, as he had, that body and no other, but no longer susceptible of hunger,
or of any similar thing, nor yet one sustained by foods, it is assuredly
necessary that our bodies also should not want anything; for Paul said, «As we
were clad in the image of the earthy, so shall we also be clad m the image of
him that is from heaven» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#957"><SUP>957</SUP></A>. For the fact that he ate and drank with
the disciples as it is written <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#958"><SUP>958</SUP></A> and received food should be ascribed
to dispensation; because he did this same thing in order to confirm the nature
of the body that had risen and cast out the supposition of phantasy. But, even
though in conflict with the beginning of the argument, I say this also, guiding
my opinions by the labour of the God-clad guides to the mysteries, <A NAME="p360"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|360</SPAN></A>
that, even if we expect the kingdom of heaven, and an end that is greater
than the life of Paradise, we are not debarred from expecting a fresh return of
the primitive state; for Basil the great said in the homily entitled ' God is
not the cause of evils' that, if Adam had kept the commandment and not
transgressed, suprasensual prizes and crowns and such as raise to an equality of
honour with the angels were prepared for him; for he wrote as follows: «It was
not fitting that he should have clothes either from nature or from
craftsmanship, but there were others prepared for the man, if he displayed
virtues, clothes such as by God's grace glistened and were to flash, shining
garments, as those of the angels also are, surpassing the varied hues of the
flowers, and excelling the light of the stars. For this reason therefore the
garments were not immediately forthcoming, because they were prizes of virtue
reserved for the man, to which by Satan's fraud he did not receive permission to
attain» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#959"><SUP>959</SUP></A>. For us to adduce the food of the angels who were
<A NAME="p361"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|361</SPAN></A> entertained by Abraham is very much beside the point; for how can those
who appeared as in a vision and a symbol be patterns for the things that are expected by us in reality? Shall we say that these three, who appeared to
the, patriarch in the likeness of men, and signified the Holy Trinity (for
the sacred Scripture said that God himself was manifested to Abraham <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#960"><SUP>960</SUP></A>),
ate of that unleavened bread and partook of that calf in such a way that these
things actually passed into the digestion and the material exits, and not rather
that they were invisibly consumed in a manner which God understands, who brought about these things? But how is it anything but foolish and an act
of great madness for us here to think of the phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#961"><SUP>961</SUP></A>
of
Eutyches? Eutyches by comparing our Saviour's dispensation in the flesh, by
means of which the word of God shared our nature, to earlier utterances and revelations of
<A NAME="p362"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|362</SPAN></A> God both to prophets and to patriarchs, which were described in symbols and
adumbrations as being of God, missed the right principle. But we, who follow the
apostolic teachings, who know that a vision shown in a symbol is one thing, and
the truth of the fact another, pronounce that the coming of the Word in the
flesh is quite distinct from the earlier manifestations which were made as in a
dream and an adumbration. For we also hear of revelations coming from God which
say to Aaron and Miriam, «If there shall be among you a prophet to the Lord, I
will be made known to him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#962"><SUP>962</SUP></A>,
and cry in Hosea the prophet, «I for my part multiplied visions, and by means
of prophets was I likened» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#963"><SUP>963</SUP></A>. But he who multiplied visions and was
variously likened by means of prophets became man for our sake truly and without
variation, and in a new way. As therefore the shadowy and primitive symbols in
no way impair by comparison the fact that our Lord and God Jesus Christ became
in truth man invariably, so we do not on account of his true Incarnation refuse
to hold the earlier symbols and obscure revelations given as in a dream and
visions to be <A NAME="p363"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|363</SPAN></A> adumbrations, since the Holy Scriptures cry this out with loud voice. Since then
these things are so, we must shun the false opinion of those who think that the
enjoyment promised in the kingdom of heaven consists in some sensual foods, an
opinion into which Irenaeus bishop of Lyons in Gaul fell, who through the books
of Papias departed from the truth, as Eusebius, who composed the Ecclesiastical Histories for us, wrote
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#964"><SUP>964</SUP></A>. Those who so hold, and expect a kind of
recurrence of a cycle, are of a folly which even madmen do not possess; into
which the witless Apollinaris also fell. This is as much as we are able to write
on the present question, according to our small capacity. But it is the duty of
your saintliness after the reading of these things to acquaint us by letter what
was the frame of mind of those who disputed about this; for we shall think this
a reward for our labours, to know clearly if after what has been written the
supporters of the contrary opinion were helped. The other thing also do not
forget, that, if after reading these things they retain any contrary opinion in
their mind, we shall perhaps not be wanting in the needed medicines for this
also. <A NAME="p364"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|364</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>[519-38.] And the other thing also which you ask is a question of the
Phantasiasts who hold the opinions of the Manichees, since they think that they are
propounding and saying something against which it is impossible to argue: «If
our Lord underwent the circumcision required by the law, 'when', as the gospel
says, 'eight days were accomplished for circumcising him, and his name was
called Jesus' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#965"><SUP>965</SUP></A>, what happened to his foreskin?»; for those wretched
men think that they are driving us into a corner, and do not understand that it
would be an act of their own godless lack of intelligence <A NAME="p365"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|365</SPAN></A>
for us to refuse to acknowledge things that are written on account of things
that are not written. It is not the gospel only which testifies through these
words which have been cited that Christ was circumcised according to the law,
but Paul also, who in writing to the Romans says, «For I say that Christ became
a minister of circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, that he might confirm
the promises made to the fathers» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#966"><SUP>966</SUP></A><i>. </i>For to Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob our fathers both the covenant of circumcision was given,
and the promise was made, «In thy seed shall all the families of the nations be
blessed» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#967"><SUP>967</SUP></A>; for Christ was their seed. Therefore also in writing the
epistle to the Galatians he says, «But to Abraham were the promises made and to
his seed; for he saith not 'and to seeds' as to many, but, as to one, 'and to
thy seed', which is Christ» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#968"><SUP>968</SUP></A>. In order to carry out the
accomplishment of those promises therefore Christ came, and truly to endure <A NAME="p366"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|366</SPAN></A>
circumcision in the flesh, and to carry out the dispensation that consists in
this; for the whole principle of the dispensation is dispensation and service;
and so he caught all the nations by faith in him and made them Abraham's sons.
Since therefore the God-inspired Scripture says that he was circumcised in
reality, who is he who presumes to say that he did not undergo circumcision? a
thing which those who teach the phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#969"><SUP>969</SUP></A> seek to deny along with
the other things. Because nothing is written about the portion of himself that
was cut off (I refer to the foreskin), we will not therefore refrain from
confessing that he was circumcised in reality, he who said, «For so it becometh
us to fulfil all justice» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#970"><SUP>970</SUP></A>, and was in everything made like unto us
except sin <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#971"><SUP>971</SUP></A>. Perhaps indeed some God-befitting miracle was performed
with regard to the portion that was cut off, which Scripture left unknown to us;
and for us to guess about unknown matters is a thing of great danger.
But what <A NAME="p367"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|367</SPAN></A> is assuredly already known
is this, that, when he rose from the dead,
he took that also, inasmuch as it is a portion of the whole body, and he
preserved it with this without corruption according to ineffable methods which
he understands. For we also shall receive our own body complete at the
resurrection, not carrying the diminution caused by sores or other injuries, but
whole and perfect. It is a good thing to ask the impious men, who think that by
such questions they frighten those who believe rightly, so as to reduce us not
to acknowledge <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#972"><SUP>972</SUP></A> that our Lord suffered real sufferings in the body, what they
themselves say about the blood which came out from the pure rib mixed with
water. Did it reach the earth? For this also is <A NAME="p368"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|368</SPAN></A>
not declared by the holy Scripture of the gospel. But let them themselves be
frightened by the fear of loss; and it is consistent for them to say that the
blood was poured, out in semblance only, and did not flow in reality. But John,
who became bishop of Constantinople and was a preacher of the true dispensation
with boldness, in the homily entitled 'Concerning the cross and
concerning the robber, and concerning the fact that we should frequently pray
for enemies' was not frightened by the fear of these impious men, but said that
the blood dropped upon the earth and purified the whole of it, inasmuch as he
wrote thus: «But why is he slaughtered at the height of the tree, and not under
a roof? In order to purify the nature of the air, therefore it is done high up,
without a roof above him, but heaven. For <A NAME="p369"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|369</SPAN></A>
the air was purified by the sheep being sacrificed high up. But the earth
also was purified; for the blood dropped from the rib upon it» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#973"><SUP>973</SUP></A>.
Accordingly therefore, if on this analogy the foreskin that was cut off touched
the earth, it assuredly also sanctified it, and by methods which he himself
understands who was voluntarily circumcised, he assuredly, as I said before,
preserved it; and at the time of the Resurrection he rose with the whole body
complete and without corruption, having this portion also undiminished, although
he showed the scars of the nails and the lance; with which he will also appear
to those who pierced him, according to the unerring words of the God-inspired
Scripture <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#974"><SUP>974</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p370"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|370</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>[519-38.] But to the question which your excellency's magnificence has asked
me by letter I return an easy answer, that for my part I have never accepted or
expressed agreement with those who speak of an <i>apokatastasis, </i>and an end
to the judgment involved in the torments that are threatened us in the future
world, and the man who says that he has a letter of mine which proclaims this
opinion manifestly lies. Therefore I praised your God-loving magnificence for
asking for such a letter to be shown to you; a letter which the man who
concocted it necessarily set himself falsely to show to be my composition. Those
who hold such an opinion, wishing to accomplish their desires, as if forsooth on
the basis of plausible suppositions, make use of arguments that are gratifying
to the hearers, saying that it is unbecomingto or unworthy <A NAME="p371"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|371</SPAN></A>
of God, and far removed from his mercifulness, that the man who has sinned
for 50 or 100 years in this world should endure torments for unending ages,
forgetting this, that God's laws and those which, prevail among men think fit to
requite sins according to the intention of the sinner, and one may hear even
wise men outside saying of certain persons who have done foul deeds and acts that are not permitted, «This man deserves to die not once but many
times»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#975"><SUP>975</SUP></A>. But, when a man hears as we do that God who became
incarnate and was humanized without variation for our salvation, and who for
this reason came down from heaven and conversed with us plainly threatens <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#976"><SUP>976</SUP></A>
fire that is not quenched and an undying worm <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#977"><SUP>977</SUP></A>, and
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#978"><SUP>978</SUP></A> makes light of it, how does he not deserve, if it is possible to say so, to be condemned
<A NAME="p372"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|372</SPAN></A> twice over to <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#979"><SUP>979</SUP></A>
endless torment? If a man live 100 years or more in
this present world and spend such a period in vanity, it is certain that this
man, if he were allowed to live this same temporal life <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#980"><SUP>980</SUP></A>
without end <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#981"><SUP>981</SUP></A>,
would not cease from his eternal <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#980"><SUP>980</SUP></A> greed and wantonness
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#982"><SUP>982</SUP></A>.
How therefore will this man in accordance with his disposition not justly <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#980"><SUP>980</SUP></A>
be tormented without end? Even the very men who introduce an <i>apokatastasis </i><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#983"><SUP>983</SUP></A>
say of sinners that they will be tormented for many <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#984"><SUP>984</SUP></A>
and long
periods so to speak <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#985"><SUP>985</SUP></A>, and then afterwards will be purified and
admitted to clemency and attain to the promised blessedness. But they <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#986"><SUP>986</SUP></A>
forget that their human reasonings <A NAME="p373"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|373</SPAN></A>
themselves show God to be unrighteous in his judgments <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#987"><SUP>987</SUP></A>. If a man
lives <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#988"><SUP>988</SUP></A> in sin 50 or 80 years, but <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#989"><SUP>989</SUP></A>
endures torments many
long generations, it is again apparent on their principle that this is not
worthy of God's mercifulness <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#990"><SUP>990</SUP></A>, to extend the period of torment beyond
the time of the life in sins, If God agreed with the reasonings of those who
think thus <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#991"><SUP>991</SUP></A>, the man who sins for 50 years should endure torment for
50 years, and it <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#992"><SUP>992</SUP></A> should not be thus long extended over many
generations, as they say <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#993"><SUP>993</SUP></A>. For our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
also, in the holy words of his preaching, when <A NAME="p374"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|374</SPAN></A>
separating the righteous from the sinners, said, «These shall go to eternal
torment, and the righteous to eternal life» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#994"><SUP>994</SUP></A>, and with regard to
both the classes <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#995"><SUP>995</SUP></A>, that of the former and that of the latter, he
spoke in exactly the same fashion of an equality without distinction, applying
the word ' eternal' to both without distinction. Basil the great among teachers
of the truth shows this clearly in the teaching composed by him in the form of
question and answer addressed to the brethren of the convents; and it is the
219th question, which is expressed as follows:
</p>
<p align="center">«The brethren say <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#996"><SUP>996</SUP></A>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p> 'If <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#997"><SUP>997</SUP></A> one shall be beaten with many
stripes and another with few, how <A NAME="p375"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|375</SPAN></A> say some that there is no end to the sentence of those who are tormented?'
</p>
<p align="center">Basil <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#998"><SUP>998</SUP></A> says.
</p>
<p>Points which are matters of dispute and seen to be obscurely expressed m
various places of the Holy Scriptures are elucidated by clear statements in
other places. Since therefore our Lord says at one time, 'These shall go into
eternal torment <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#999"><SUP>999</SUP></A>', and at another dismisses some to 'the eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels', and at another mentions 'the <i>gehenna </i>of
fire', uttering further the words,<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1000"><SUP>1000</SUP></A> 'Where their worm dieth not, and
their fire is not quenched', and again said before through the prophet about
certain <A NAME="p376"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|376</SPAN></A> men, <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1001"><SUP>1001</SUP></A>
'Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be
quenched'; while these and similar expressions, are often <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1002"><SUP>1002</SUP></A>
used in
the divine Scriptures, this also was brought about by the machination of the
devil, in order that men, forgetting these and similar decrees of our Lord,
might presume to sin without restraint, persuading themselves that there is an
end to judgment. For, if it is possible for there to be <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1003"><SUP>1003</SUP></A>
an end to
eternal judgment, there will assuredly also be an end to eternal life. But, if
we do not consent to think this with regard to <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1004"><SUP>1004</SUP></A>
life, what
plausibility is there in our assigning <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1005"><SUP>1005</SUP></A> an end to eternal judgment?
For the addition of the word 'eternal' is made equally in both cases. 'These
shall go into eternal <A NAME="p377"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|377</SPAN></A> judgment, and the righteous into eternal life'. These things therefore being
thus admitted, we must know that the words 'He shall be beaten with many stripes' and 'shall be beaten with few' are not an end, but signify a
difference of torment. For, if God is an upright judge, not only to the good but also to the
evil <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1006"><SUP>1006</SUP></A>, and requites each according to his deeds, it is
possible for one to be in the fire that is not quenched <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1007"><SUP>1007</SUP></A>, burning either
less or more than the other, and another in the worm that dies not, both one that hurts
little and one that hurts much <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1008"><SUP>1008</SUP></A>, each as he deserves, and another
in <i>gehenna </i>that has a variety of torments, and another in outer darkness, and that there
<A NAME="p378"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|378</SPAN></A> is a place where a man is found amidst weeping only, and there is a place
where he is amidst gnashing of teeth also from the severity of the pains <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1009"><SUP>1009</SUP></A>.
But the outer darkness signifies that there is in truth an inner darkness also.<sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1010"><SUP>1010</SUP></A>
</sup>And the words used in the Proverbs <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1011"><SUP>1011</SUP></A> 'at the bottom of Sheol
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1012"><SUP>1012</SUP></A>'
signify that there are persons in Sheol and not at the bottom of it, because
their torment is smaller <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1013"><SUP>1013</SUP></A>. And this is depicted now also in bodily
afflictions. For there is aman who is in a fever together with other pains, and
another <A NAME="p379"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|379</SPAN></A> who is in a fever only, and the latter is not like the former, and another
has no fever, but is troubled by pain in some limb <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1014"><SUP>1014</SUP></A>, and one again either
less or more than another. But this expression 'much' or 'little' is employed by our Lord in accordance with customary usage, as are also many other
similar phrases. For we know that this form of speech is frequently adopted even with regard to those who are suffering from one disease
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1015"><SUP>1015</SUP></A>. For example, in the case of a man who has a fever only, or has pain in the eye
only <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1016"><SUP>1016</SUP></A> we <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1017"><SUP>1017</SUP></A> say in astonishment ' How much he has
suffered! ' or ' What anguish he has endured!' Accordingly the expression 'shall be beaten with many'
<A NAME="p380"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|380</SPAN></A> and 'with few', I say again, stands not in the extent of the time
and
the shortness<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1018"><SUP>1018</SUP></A>, but in the difference of the torment»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1019"><SUP>1019</SUP></A>. These
things this great ruler and shepherd of rational souls Basil taught and stated
with great completeness.<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1020"><SUP>1020</SUP></A> And Gregory, who became bishop of
Nazianzus, himself in the homily of defence thinks that the future torment is
endless, teaching thus: «But for us, the salvation of whose blessed and
immortal soul is in danger, which will be undyingly tormented or glorified<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1021"><SUP>1021</SUP></A>
by reason of wickedness or of virtue, how great do you think should the contest
be<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1022"><SUP>1022</SUP></A>?»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1023"><SUP>1023</SUP></A> And John in the 66<sup>th</sup> homily<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1024"><SUP>1024</SUP></A>
of the commentary on the Gospel of Matthew <A NAME="p381"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|381</SPAN></A>
states things consonant with these as follows: <i>«</i>For all these reasons
accordingly let us first pay the taxes; for it is indeed very easy, and the
reward is greater, and there is great abundance of profit, and worse is the
torture if we do not understand, and a torture that has no end»<sup>4</sup>.
And the same again in the 79<sup>th</sup> exposition when speaking of the
Passion referred to the kingdom, and to the endless torment. And in the 82<sup>nd
</sup>about the man who approaches the communion of the holy mysteries in a
careless mood and without caution he gives teaching in the following words: «He
who approaches after he has sinned is worse than a demoniac; for the: latter
because they have a demon do not receive punishment, but the <A NAME="p382"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|382</SPAN></A>
former, because they approach unworthily, are delivered to undying torment <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1025"><SUP>1025</SUP></A>»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1026"><SUP>1026</SUP></A>.
And at the end of the commentary on the epistle to the Ephesians he <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1027"><SUP>1027</SUP></A>
expressed himself thus: «For a man to be burnt <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1028"><SUP>1028</SUP></A>
and not consumed,
and to be perpetually gnawed by a <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1029"><SUP>1029</SUP></A> worm is indestructible
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1030"><SUP>1030</SUP></A> destruction, as happened to the blessed Job, who was in process of destruction
and did not perish for a considerable time, but was constantly suffering and
wasting away, while he scraped off putrid matter from his body <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1031"><SUP>1031</SUP></A>
for
a long time. Something similar will happen to the soul at that time, when the <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1032"><SUP>1032</SUP></A>
worms surround and gnaw it, not for two years <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1033"><SUP>1033</SUP></A>
nor for ten nor for a hundred nor <A NAME="p383"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|383</SPAN></A> for myriads
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1034"><SUP>1034</SUP></A>, but for years without end; for 'their worm', he
says, 'shall not die'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1035"><SUP>1035</SUP></A>. The wise Cyril <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1036"><SUP>1036</SUP></A>
also in the 1<sup>st</sup>
book of the commentary on the Gospel of John said: &quot;We ought not to be
ungrateful to God but on the contrary <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1037"><SUP>1037</SUP></A> to thank him because by means
of the Resurrection from the dead he has appointed for us torment that does not
pass away <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1038"><SUP>1038</SUP></A>»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1039"><SUP>1039</SUP></A>.

<p>[519-38] «But in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them walking on
the sea»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1041"><SUP>1041</SUP></A>. Know therefore that it is the custom in a city for the
sake of <A NAME="p384"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|384</SPAN></A> precaution against housebreakers and thieves, as well as in military camps
for the sake of precaution against an attack upon them by their enemies, to<i> </i>keep
ward by night and watch in turns; and some watch during the first portion of the
night, and go round the city or the camp, and some during the second portion and
some during the <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1042"><SUP>1042</SUP></A> third, and others during the fourth, and others at
the very appearance of dawn, those who follow in succession coming in in order
after the previous ones are tired. And this is recorded even in the Old
Testament Scriptures also. When Gideon was ordered to attack a city
by night, I mean the camp of the Midianites, the divine Scripture said: «And
Gideon went in and the 100 men who were with him into a part of the camp when
they had begun the middle watch, when those who set the guards had just set
them, and they sounded the horns» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1043"><SUP>1043</SUP></A>. And in the 2<sup>nd</sup> book
of Ezra, when the walls of Jerusalem were being built, and the barbarians who
lived near the country wished to assail them and stop the work, it is written
thus: «And I prayed to our God, and we set guards over us day and night against
them»; and again, «At that time I said to the <A NAME="p385"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|385</SPAN></A>
people, 'Every man with his slave shall go up and down in the midst of
Jerusalem, and let us take night for the first watch, and day for the work'».
Accordingly therefore the evangelist desired to signify the very time of night
at which Jesus, who is God appeared to his disciples when distressed in the boat
walking on the sea.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>(And after other things.)</i>
</p>
<p>But that which is written in the divine gospels about the cloak with which
the Romans at the time of the Passion and of the voluntary saving Cross sought
to clothe our Lord and God Jesus Christ, and indeed did actually clothe him, for
the purpose of mockery contains no discrepancy, because Matthew related as
follows: «And, when they had stripped him, they put on him a cloak of scarlet»,
and Mark, «And they clothe him in purple robes», and John, «And they covered
him with a purple garment». You should understand that the rascally company of
soldiers, by way of prolonging the mockery and ridicule and derision for him,
first clothed him with the cloak of scarlet, that is red, and after this with
the purple one, <A NAME="p386"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|386</SPAN></A> thinking by the change of attire to increase the mockery. That they did this
for the sake of mockery is plainly signified by the story told by Luke also, for
he said that, when Pilate learned that Jesus was from Galilee, he sent him to
Herod, on the ground that the supremacy and authority was by right his, and he
was glad to see him; and when he did not hear any word from him, or see any sign
done by him, but found him silent, 'having set him at naught' (he says) 'with
his soldiers and made fun of him, having clad him in splendid robes, sent him to
Pilate'. But, if one considers the matter carefully and minutely, one may say
that there is one cloak, of purple, but of purple which contains some inferior
dark tincture, so that it disavows the true purple, and changes its appearance
to one that is redder, and appears to hold a position approximating to both
colours, and to be each of them, and in strictness is neither of them.'
Accordingly the evangelists looked one at the one colour and the other at the
other, so as to mention each of them both with the same meaning and in different
terms. Since it was the purpose of those blasphemers against God to pile up the
whole mass <A NAME="p387"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|387</SPAN></A> of insult and increase the mockery, for this reason they found even the very
dress which, as they thought, would excite much mockery; but the mystery
contained in it which was hidden was shown by each of the colours, in order that
the purple colour might show the King of kings and Lord and God, who was of his
own will coming to the Passion, while the scarlet and red showed the fact that
he himself took the whole of our sin, so that he was clad in the crimson cloak
of blood, and nailed this to the saving Gross. For he suffered who knows not
sin, not on his own behalf (may we never say this!), but rather on behalf of our
sins. This therefore John also the ambassador said: «Behold! the Lamb of God
who beareth the sin of the world» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1044"><SUP>1044</SUP></A>. And Peter the chief of the
apostles wrote in his epistle: «He took up our own sins in his body on to the
tree, in order that being separated from the sins we may live in righteousness»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1045"><SUP>1045</SUP></A>.
And the wise Paul wrote to the Corinthians about God and the Father, who wishes
with him that he should suffer for for the sake of the salvation of the race of
all men: «Him who knew not sin he made sin for our sake, that we in him may
become righteousness unto God» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1046"><SUP>1046</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p388"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|388</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For there is also another further question which you ask, as to how we should
understand the statement made by Gregory the Theologian in the 2<sup>nd </sup>peace-making
homily about the Holy Trinity in the following words: «A perfect Trinity of
three perfect ones, Unity having been moved on account of wealthiness, while
duality was passed over on account of the material and the form of which bodies
consist, and a Trinity was fixed on account of perfection, for it first passes
the composition of a duality, in order that the Godhead may not remain narrow,
nor be diffused into infinitude; for the one is mean, and the other disorderly,
and the one is utterly Jewish, and the other heathen and polytheistic»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1047"><SUP>1047</SUP></A>.
This abominable notion must therefore first be removed from our mind, that we
should not <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1048"><SUP>1048</SUP></A> think that the Father first existed in his own sole
hypostasis, and was moved as if by some <A NAME="p389"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|389</SPAN></A>
afterthought to put forth another hypostasis, that of the Son, and similarly
further conceived the thought of putting forth a third hypostasis also from
himself, that of the Spirit, in order that he might exist in a Trinity. On this
theory it will result that the Son and the Holy Spirit are not ever-existing but
were afterwards added to the Father, and we shall give occasion for the
blasphemy of Arius who says, «There was once when the Son and the Holy Spirit
were not». But this is abominable; for one who was acquired later and came into
being afterwards is not God; for the Holy Trinity is of equal everlastingness,
and it is therefore understood and acknowledged to be one God truly in three
hypostases. The words used by the doctor we should therefore understand in the
same way as that which is stated in Wisdom, «From the greatness and beauty of
created things the causer of their birth <A NAME="p390"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|390</SPAN></A>
is inferentially seen» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1049"><SUP>1049</SUP></A>; and from formed creation and this
visible world we may conceive not only of the wisdom and power of him who
created them, but also of the very peerlessless of his Godhead in regard of
creation, and its distance in all points and lack of similarity. We see that all
the bodies which make up the world are composed of material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1050"><SUP>1050</SUP></A> and
form, and arise from a duality; but what material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1050"><SUP>1050</SUP></A>
and form are we
will state in the form of an example. For instance the potter's material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1050"><SUP>1050</SUP></A>
for the craft is the clay, but he adds the form to the material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1050"><SUP>1050</SUP></A>,
that is to say, that which belongs to the fashioning of the vessel that is being
manufactured, a jar or a pot or anything of the kind. But in this case the
potter is the maker of the form only, and he borrows the material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1050"><SUP>1050</SUP></A>.
But God, the Maker of all and perfect in craftsmanship, both brought the
material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1050"><SUP>1050</SUP></A> of every body from that which did not exist and added the
form; and, if you speak of fire or of earth, or <A NAME="p391"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|391</SPAN></A>
of air <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1051"><SUP>1051</SUP></A> or of water, or of the sky and the sun and the moon and
the other stars, he both formed the material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1052"><SUP>1052</SUP></A>
of all of them out of
non-existent things, and the form was devised for them in different ways at the
moment that they came into being, and he is both the Maker and the adorner of
the shapeless material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1052"><SUP>1052</SUP></A> of the bodies, in that he differentiated it
into the various forms of the bodies. And this Wisdom also states, when it
declares concerning Pharaoh and the Egyptians, who were vexed by the serpent and
the vile reptile: «For neither was thine almighty hand, which created the world
out of shapeless material, at a loss to send against them either a multitude of
wolves or fierce lions» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1053"><SUP>1053</SUP></A>. Therefore our mind, seeing that the bodies
in this tangible world consist as we have said of material <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1052"><SUP>1052</SUP></A>
and form, <A NAME="p392"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|392</SPAN></A> and that they arise from a duality, and being instructed by the sacred
Scriptures that there is one Godhead in a Trinity, wonders and is amazed at the
profoundness of the theology, since it sees a corresponding fact in creation,
and is as it were initiated into a mystery and learns from creation the
inaccessibility of the Trinity and its lack of likeness to and community with
creation, and reflects in itself and says: The reason then why the Godhead does
not exist in one hypostasis is that it may not be inferior to the bodies,
falling short in the restriction of number. And it does not again exist in a
duality, because it shuns similarity to the bodies, which arise from a duality,
but it only appears in a Trinity and as plural, which is admirable; for in the
Trinity is completed the unique number which follows two. Therefore also, when
Moses said to him, «Show me thyself, let me see thee plainly», he refused
this, saying, «Thou wilt not be able to see my face, for a man shall not see my
face and live»; but he added, «Thou shalt see my back parts, <A NAME="p393"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|393</SPAN></A>
but my face shall not be seen by thee» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1054"><SUP>1054</SUP></A>; signifying that by the
very essence <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1055"><SUP>1055</SUP></A> </sup>and by the sight, as one may say, of the face no man
can comprehend God, but from his back parts a man shall know the things that
pertain to him. out his back parts are created things which came into being
afterwards, through which he is inferentially seen as the causer of their birth,
as our father the Theologian himself also said in the 2<sup>nd</sup> theological
homily: «These are God's back parts, all things which, being after him, make
him known, like the shadows and reflexions of the. sun upon waters, which show
the sun to weak eyes, because they cannot look at it, since by the purity of the
light <A NAME="p394"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|394</SPAN></A> it overcomes the perception»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1056"><SUP>1056</SUP></A>. And therefore in the passage now
before us for interpretation he applied the expression 'movement of the Unity
towards a duality' to the everlasting birth of the Son from the Father, and
'passing over of the duality' to the procession of the Holy Spirit which is
timeless and thereby without beginning, and by means of the words used as we
have said he gave a philosophical <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1057"><SUP>1057</SUP></A> explanation in mysterious and
divine fashion of the lack of community in the Trinity towards bodies which
exist in a duality. The passage contained in the homily entitled 'of Lights'
which says, «But where there is purification there is shining, and shining is
the completion of love, to those who desire things that are great, or that which
<A NAME="p395"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|395</SPAN></A> is great, or beyond what is great»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1058"><SUP>1058</SUP></A>, is plain and contains
nothing difficult of comprehension. What he said is, «Where there is
purification of the soul by means of virtues, there is the shining of knowledge,
which raises and uplifts to the satisfaction of divine love». But the
satisfaction of love is the end of things delightful and pleasing, which is God,
who exists and is made known in things that are great, and in that which is.
great, and beyond that which is great; in things that are great in the three
hypostases which are equal in power and of which none is in anything inferior to
the others in power and in equality in all things, except that they are distinct
in the matter of non-generation and generation and procession, in the unconfused
individualities which stamp each of the hypostases; in that which is great, <A NAME="p396"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|396</SPAN></A>
because he is one and the same and because of the Unity of the Godhead; and
beyond that which is great, because he is not limited by size and quantity. For,
in. that we employ the poverty of names that exists among us, we name God great,
when he is more than great. Therefore also the Psalmist said: «Great is the
Lord and very admirable; and there is no end to his greatness»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1059"><SUP>1059</SUP></A>. For
all greatness is limited, but the Godhead cannot be limited, and is not limited
by any boundary. <A NAME="p397"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|397</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p>[519-33.] You say therefore that it has been discovered by certain persons
concerning Balaam the soothsayer and seer and propitiator of falsely-named gods
that it is testified by the divine words that he had such power in his mouth <A NAME="p400"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|400</SPAN></A>
that those whom he blessed were bles'sed, and those on the contrary whom he
cursed were cursed. For this reason therefore the man who bore such a character
was then lifted up to bless Israel also the holy people, the people which was
named God's people; for you say that the same men who discovered this plainly
produce these words. And at this I am not surprised; for it is the peculiarity
of those who repeat the contents of divine Scripture cursorily and as it were
from hearing, and not from learning and accurate knowledge, to arrive at false
and erring notions. Where did the divine Scripture testify of the reprobate
Balaam, as they said, that he had such a power? Moses who wrote these things,
being inspired <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1060"><SUP>1060</SUP></A> by the very excellent Spirit and being a minister of
the truth, neither gave this testimony as in his own person, nor said of God
that he gave any such testimony concerning Balaam, but recorded that Balak, King
of the Moabites, being a demon-worshipper and a slave of foul fiends, thought of
Balaam the soothsayer that he could curse and bless authoritatively and not in a
worthless manner. And it is a simple thing to listen to the divine Scriptures
manifestly proclaiming this: «And Balak son of Zippor, King of Moab, was at
that time, and he sent <A NAME="p401"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|401</SPAN></A> ambassadors to Balaam son of Beor the interpreter of dreams, who was on the
river-land of the sons of his people, to call him. saying. 'Lo! a people hath
come out of Egypt, and lo! they have covered the face of the land, and this
people hath encamped round me. And now come, curse me this people, because this
people is stronger than we, in case we may be able to overthrow some of them,
and cast them out of the land; because I know that they whom thou blessest are
blessed, and they whom thcu cursest are cursed'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1061"><SUP>1061</SUP></A>. Since therefore
Balak and the Moabites who were under subjection to him, and the Midianites
their neighbours, who were barbarians, held this belief, God 'who wisheth that
all men should live and come to the knowledge of the truth' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1062"><SUP>1062</SUP></A>
according to the apostle's saying, instructing our race, hard as it is to turn,
by many various methods, first showed his power with which none can contend, and
displayed the kings round about them, Sihon, King of the Amorites, and Og, King
of Bashan, who were giants, and trusted to their strength, and were eager to
engage in battle, and met Israel in warlike guise, slain with the sword and dead
together with their followers; and <A NAME="p402"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|402</SPAN></A>
afterwards, when the same Balak, prince, of the Moabites, as we have said,
perceived the feebleness of his own power, and feared lest he also should become
the prey of the Israelite sword, and had recourse to the power of the
falsely-named gods, and thought that by means of the soothsayer's curse he was
escaping from his troubles, the wisdom that is higher than all understanding
instructed the barbarian by the instrumentality of the very soothsayer himself
in whom he trusted that there is no other god beside him, and that by the very
demons and the very soothsayers who serve them witness is borne that he alone is
true God. For it is his habit to convert those who are in error to the truth by
the very paths of the error. And this we do not say out of our imagination, but
because we learn it from Scripture itself. It is recorded in the first book of
Kingdoms that the Philistines who dwelt in Ascalon and Gaza and the neighbouring
cities took arms against Israel and won a great victory over them in combat,
insomuch that together with the rest of the spoil they took the ark of God also
and placed it in the sanctuaries and shrines of the idols, and every city to
which they carried it was smitten with the disease of emerods for which there
was no cure, and the land produced a multitude of mice, and they [deliberated] <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1063"><SUP>1063</SUP></A>
and took counsel <A NAME="p403"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|403</SPAN></A> what they could do to escape from such distresses, and, having called upon
the soothsayers, who were accustomed to instigate their actions by making use of the deceit of demons, they begged them to find a means of release
from these calamities, and those men proposed to them the following plan; to bring cows that were first-born
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1064"><SUP>1064</SUP></A> and were unaccustomed to the
yoke, and to yoke these to a new cart bearing the ark and golden figures of the emerods and of the mice, equal in number to the cities that had been smitten
with a plague of this kind, and upon this to shut up the calves that had been born in one house, that, if their mothers went on drawing the cart to the
land of Judah, where the ark was previously placed, they might know that the God of Israel had laid the plagues upon them as a punishment, but, if
hey turned towards the cry of the calves and were affected in accordance with their own natural instincts, they might learn that it was not on account
of Israel that the punishment came upon them, but they happened as men to suffer these things. And, when these things had been thus stated, those
cows as if very forcibly driven by the command of God, went of their own <A NAME="p404"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|404</SPAN></A>
accord to the land of Judah and brought the ark with the propitiatory
offerings, though it was not those words of the soothsayers that were able to do
these things, but God himself acted according to their words, and by means of
the soothsaying to which they were accustomed and which they loved led the
Philistines who were in error to the knowledge of the truth. So too
Nebuchadnezzar also had future things revealed to him beforehand by an ordinary
vision seen in dreams, in order that by Daniel's wise interpretation concerning
the things seen in the dream the Babylonians might know what the God of the
Hebrews was; and Nebuchadnezzar must not on this account be placed among
religious men, as neither must the soothsayers who advised the Philistines to
adopt the above-mentioned plan; for even they themselves also could if they
wished on the strength of such signs have recognised God and not remained in
error. For neither did God bring such things about for any other purpose,
condescending as he did at times to men who were not in the perfect state,
except that every man might be saved, because he is indeed the Creator of all.
The prophesyings and workings of miracles are not under all circumstances
performed by men who are worthy, but perhaps by men who are unworthy also for
their own profit, because they are <A NAME="p405"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|405</SPAN></A>
barbarians, and cannot be brought to religion by teaching or by any other
similar method. This same thing our Lord and God Jesus Christ also said in the
gospel: «Many shall say in that day, 'Our Lord,] our Lord, did we not in
[thy] name prophesy, and in [thy] name cast out demons, and in thy name do many
mighty works?' and then will I profess unto them, ' I never knew you, depart ye
from me, workers of iniquity'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1065"><SUP>1065</SUP></A>. And Caiphas, being president and
ruler of the assembly of the Jews that contended with God, those who crucified
our Lord, said prophetically that he should be crucified for the people; and
this John the Evangelist who was indeed the Theologian described as follows: «But
one of them, Caiaphas, who was the high-priest of that year, said to them, 'Ye
know nothing, and do not consider that it is expedient for us that one man die
for the people, and the whole people perish not'. But this he said not of
himself, but, because he was the high-priest of that year, he prophesied that
Jesus should die for the people, and not for the people only, but also that he
might gather into one the sons of God who were scattered»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1066"><SUP>1066</SUP></A>.
Accordingly therefore neither <A NAME="p406"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|406</SPAN></A> Caiaphas nor Balaam are
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1067"><SUP>1067</SUP></A> religious men, but actually blasphemers and
contenders against God, and remained in the snares of impiety, although God, In
order to show the truth, and in order to convert those who were in error, made
use of their words.
</p>
<p>(<i>And after other things</i>.) The citations which we have made from the
testimonies of the divine Scriptures are in themselves sufficient; but I will
show by means of a few instances that the genuine doctors of the church also
have taught us to think and say these things. The very wise John who became
bishop of Constantinople in the 6<sup>th</sup> homily of the commentary on the
Gospel of Matthew, when he was speaking about the Magi who by seeing the star
were led to know our Lord and God Jesus, who was in swaddling-clothes and was
being nurtured on milk from his mother's breast in the flesh, teaches as
follows: «And wherefore did he attract them by such a sight? But how should he
have done so? Should he have sent prophets? but the Magi would not have
submitted to the prophets. But should he have emitted a voice from on high? but
they would not have regarded this. But should he have sent an angel? but him
also they would accordingly have <A NAME="p407"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|407</SPAN></A> neglected. But on this account God, having set all these methods aside, calls
them by means of things to which they are accustomed, condescending greatly, and
showing them a great and peculiar star, in order by means of the size and the
beauty of the appearance to make them astonished, and by the method of movement.
Imitating these things, Paul spoke to the heathen from the starting-point of an
altar, and cites testimonies from the poets, and he spoke with the Jews from the
starting-point of circumcision, and with those who lived according to the law he
took the beginning of teaching from sacrifices. For, since each man loves that
to which he is accustomed, both God and also the men who were sent by him for
the salvation of the world used facts in this way. Do not therefore think it an
unworthy thing that he called them by means of a star; since, if it is so, you
will find fault with all the practices of the Jews also, their sacrifices and their cleansings,
and the beginnings of the months and the ark and the temple itself. For these things also received their origin from heathen denseness. But nevertheless
God for the sake of the salvation of those who had gone astray consented to be worshipped by means of the very things by which the demons outside
were worshipped, changing them himself a little, in order [that] he might <A NAME="p408"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|408</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
remove them gradually from the custom [and] bring them to the high
philosophy; a thing which he also does to the Magi, in that he consented to call
them by means of the appearance of the star, in order to make them thereafter
higher. Since therefore he brought and led them, and set them by the manger, he
did not again thereafter speak with them through a star, but through an angel,
and so they gradually became better. The same thing he did also to the men of
Ascalon and Gaza. For these five cities also, since after the coming of the ark
they had been smitten with a regular plague, and found no escape from the
plagues laid upon them, having called the soothsayers and held an assembly,
wished to find a release from the plague which came from God. But the
soothsayers said that they should yoke unbroken and firstborn <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1068"><SUP>1068</SUP></A>
cows
to the ark and let them go, no man leading them; 'for so it will be plain
whether the plague is from God, or from some chance or disease. For, if' (they
say) 'they either from inexperience break the yoke, or return to the calves when
they low, it is a chance or an accident that has happened. But, if they walk
straight, and are in no way affected by the lowing of their young, or by the
ignorance of their error <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1069"><SUP>1069</SUP></A> <A NAME="p409"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|409</SPAN></A>
in the way, it is very plain that it is God's hand that has touched these
cities'. Since therefore, after the soothsayers had said these things, those who
dwelt in these cities obeyed, and did as they commanded, God also followed the
counsel of the soothsayers, again condescending, and it did not seem to him to
be a thing unworthy of him to carry into effect the thing stated beforehand by
the soothsayers, and make them appear to be truthful men in what they spoke at
that time. For indeed the success obtained was a great thing, that the
adversaries themselves should bear witness to the power of God, and their own
teachers themselves should pronounce a decision concerning him. And many other
such things one may see that God performs by dispensation» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1070"><SUP>1070</SUP></A>. And in
the 24<sup>th</sup> homily of the same work, where he is expounding the passage
which we ourselves mentioned above, which says, «Many shall say to me on that
day, 'Our Lord, our Lord, did we not in thy name prophesy, and in thy name cast
out demons, and in thy name do many mighty works?' And then he will profess unto
them, 'I never knew you. Depart ye from me, ye who work iniquity'», he gave the
same teaching in the following form: «Who therefore are these?»<i> </i>(he
says). <A NAME="p410"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|410</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&quot;Many of those who believed received gifts, as was <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1071"><SUP>1071</SUP></A>
the man
who was casting out demons and was not with him; as was<sup>1</sup> Judas, for
even he also, being an evil man, had gifts. And in the Old Testament one will
accordingly find that the grace often worked in men who were unworthy, in order
to benefit others. For, since all had not readiness for all things, but some
were pure in life, but had not an equal amount of faith, while others were in
the converse position, he both entices the former by means of the latter in
order that they may show great faith, and calls the latter by means of this
incomprehensible grace to become virtuous. Wherefore also he used to gave the
grace with great abundance, for '«We did many mighty works». But then will I
profess unto them «I know you not». For now they think they are my friends,
but then they will know that I did not give as to friends'. And why are you
surprised if he gave his graces to men who had believed in him but had not a
life consonant to the faith, when he is in fact found to work even in men who
have fallen from both? For Balaam was an alien both to faith and to life; but
nevertheless the grace was effected in him for <A NAME="p411"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|411</SPAN></A>
the sake of influencing others. And Pharaoh likewise; but nevertheless to him also as well he showed the future. And Nebuchadnezzar was a great
transgressor of the law; and to him again he revealed things that should happen later after many generations. And to his son again who surpassed
his father in transgression of the law he showed the future, in that he
brought wonderful and great things to pass. Since therefore at that time also the
proclamation was at its beginning, and it very was desirable that a display of its power should be made, many even among the unworthy also
received gifts. But nevertheless those men gained nothing from these signs, but are even judged all the more. Wherefore also he said to them
those terrible words, 'I never knew you'. For many he already hates even here, and before the judgment turns away from them&quot;
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1072"><SUP>1072</SUP></A>. By
means of all these things therefore he clearly establishes the fact that Balaam also and
Nebuchadnezzar, and Belteshazzar the latter's son, and all such men, did not profit by the grace of God, in that they remained in the snares of
demon-worship, but even endure the decrees of the sentences of tortures all the more.
<A NAME="p412"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|412</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>(<i>And after other things</i>.) But, as to the tunic of God our Saviour
Jesus, on which those who performed the crucifixion cast lots, your mightiness'
love of God should know that we should understand the statement exactly
according to the letter. In Palestine it is the custom for men to make such
tunics as are divided in the middle and not woven together throughout, but
contain the sections of the texture separately; so that even now we may see many
such tunics, made of wool and linen, in the city of Gaza; since afterwards, when
it is about to be put on, and is skilfully and becomingly folded, that division
is concealed by the tailors. But some <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1073"><SUP>1073</SUP></A> of those who are of low
station have it all woven together from beginning to end, and these they <A NAME="p413"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|413</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
describe according to custom as being woven from the top to the bottom, since there is no division in them. But this indicates also a mystery which shows
<sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1074"><SUP>1074</SUP></A> </sup>that the Only Word who was born below in flesh is above from God and
the Father. Since every human soul has a body like some garment which springs up with it, as is said by Job the man of mighty endurance to God:
«With skin and flesh hast thou clothed me, and with bones and sinews hast thou strengthened me»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1075"><SUP>1075</SUP></A>, so also our Saviour's body, if one
conceives of it as a kind of tunic that sprang up at the same time, because it was united to
the Word invariably by a natural union, was woven from the top, that is by the coming of the Holy Spirit, and not by human seed. That these things
are so the genuine doctors of the holy church also show; for it is good that <A NAME="p414"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|414</SPAN></A>
we confirm every statement and opinion by the expressions used by these. John
who became bishop of Constantinople in the 85<sup>th</sup> homily of the
commentary on the Gospel of John wrote as follows: «But do you, I pray, observe
the prophet's accuracy; for the prophet did not say only that they divided, but
also that they did not divide. Some things they divided, but the tunic they did
not divide, but also committed the matter to lot. But the expression 'woven from
the top' is not added casually; but some say that by means of this expression
one thing is indicated in place of another, because he who was crucified was not
mere man, but had also the Godhead from above; while others say that the
evangelist is depicting the actual pattern of the tunic, for, since in Palestine
they join two pieces of material together and so weave garments, John signifies
that the tunic was not <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1076"><SUP>1076</SUP></A> of this kind, in that he says that it was
woven from the top. And this it seems to me that he says by way of signifying
the meanness of the garments, and, as in all other things, so also in raiment he
followed a simple form» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1077"><SUP>1077</SUP></A>. And Athanasius the great in the homily on
the Cross says these things: «Together with these things <A NAME="p415"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|415</SPAN></A>
he put on also an unsewn tunic that was woven from the top throughout, that
from this also the Jews might be able to believe who and whence he is who put on
these things; that the Word is not from the earth, but that he came from above,
and he is not one divided, but is without division from the Father; because,
when he became man, he had not a body that was sewn together from a man and a
woman, but one that was woven from a virgin alone by the Spirit's workmanship» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1078"><SUP>1078</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>(<i>And after other things</i>.) But, as to the passage about the sweat and
the drops of blood, know that in the divine and evangelical Scriptures that are
at Alexandria it is not written. Wherefore also the holy Cyril in the 12<sup>th</sup>
of the books written by him on behalf of the religion of the Christians against the impious demon-worshipper Julian plainly stated as follows: «But, since
he said that the divine Luke inserted among his own words the statement that an angel stood and strengthened Jesus, and his sweat dripped like blood-drops
or blood, let him learn from us that we have found nothing of this kind inserted in Luke's work, unless perhaps
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1079"><SUP>1079</SUP></A> an interpolation has been
made <A NAME="p416"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|416</SPAN></A> from outside which is not genuine. The books therefore that are among us
contain nothing whatever of this kind; and I therefore think it madness for us
to say anything to him about these things; and it is a superfluous thing to
oppose him on things that are not stated at all, and we shall be condemned to be
laughed at and that very justly» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1080"><SUP>1080</SUP></A><i>. </i>In the books therefore
that are at Antioch and in other countries it is written <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1081"><SUP>1081</SUP></A>, and some
of the fathers mention it; among whom Gregory the Theologian made mention of
this same passage in the 2<sup>nd</sup> homily on the Son <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1082"><SUP>1082</SUP></A>; and John
bishop of Constantinople in the exposition composed by him about the passage, «My
Father if possible let this cup pass from me» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1083"><SUP>1083</SUP></A>. And I myself
therefore in the 64<sup>th</sup> homily showed the religious meaning of the
things thus brought about <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1084"><SUP>1084</SUP></A>, according to the limited power that has
been given to me from above.

<p>[519-38.] But the Lord, when after the Resurrection he breathed upon the disciples
<A NAME="p417"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|417</SPAN></A> and said, «Receive the Holy Spirit»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1085"><SUP>1085</SUP></A>, (since you ask this
question also besides), gave them a beginning only of the gifts of the Spirit,
and, as one may say, one kind among the many gifts of the Spirit which Paul
enumerated in writing to the Corinthians <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1086"><SUP>1086</SUP></A>, I mean that of binding and
loosing men's sins. This was signified by the addition, in that that Giver of
the gifts of the Spirit said, «If ye forgive any men's sins they shall be
forgiven to-them; and if ye bind any men's sins they shall be bound» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1087"><SUP>1087</SUP></A>.
And by means of the breathing he taught them in very mysterious fashion that he
is himself the Creator of Adam, whom he formed out of earth and into whose face
he breathed the Spirit of life, and that he made man 'a living soul' as it is
written <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1088"><SUP>1088</SUP></A>, shining in the spiritual image and the beauty that flashes
from it, and sharing in the divine likeness. And by breathing into the disciples
he majestically shows that the Holy Spirit himself is of his essence <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1089"><SUP>1089</SUP></A>
and not alien.
</p>
<p>And in addition to that you ask this other question, how then we are able to explain how it is that our Lord Christ does not speak falsely who
says, «As Jonah was three days and three nights in the fish's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
<A NAME="p418"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|418</SPAN></A> earth <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1090"><SUP>1090</SUP></A>»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1091"><SUP>1091</SUP></A>. Some say that we are to reckon the time from
the very evening of the 5<sup>th</sup> day of the week when our Saviour supped
with the disciples, and instituted the new Passover, causing the old to cease,
since it was from that time that our Lord was virtually sacrificed of his own
accord on our behalf, and went down into the lower parts of the earth, and they
say that the one night and the six hours of the preparation should be reckoned
as one day and night, and the darkness from the 6<sup>th</sup> hour to the 9<sup>th</sup>
and the light from the 9<sup>th</sup> hour till sunset as the 2<sup>nd</sup> day
and night, so that consequentially the following night and the sabbath-day make
up the whole of the 3<sup>rd</sup> day and night, and in this way it is to be
believed that our Lord rose after three days and nights. But others <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1092"><SUP>1092</SUP></A>
have appeared to give another elucidation upon the question <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1093"><SUP>1093</SUP></A>
before
us, which is subtle and very accurate. They said that according to the custom
and tradition contained in Scripture every day with the night preceding it are <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1094"><SUP>1094</SUP></A>
combined into one entity. Thus in Exodus, when Moses was giving orders about the
Passover and about the feast of unleavened bread, he said, «When the 14<sup>th</sup>
day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month beginneth, ye <A NAME="p419"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|419</SPAN></A>
shall eat unleavened bread from the evening» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1095"><SUP>1095</SUP></A>, and he counted
the beginning of the following day from the preceding evening: and the cessation
of the sabbath he instituted the same way, so that they were to cease from work
on the preceding night and the following day; and the Jews are known to observe
this down to this day, and to honour not the night after the sabbath but the
night before the sabbath by cessation and- abstention from work; and we
ourselves on the I<sup>st</sup> day of the week honour the preceding night as
united with the honoured day, and not the night following. Accordingly therefore
they say that every night-and-day is as one may say one entity, and, what
therefore anyone does during one of these 24 hours, that act is said to have
been performed on the whole of that day. As for instance, when a man is sent on
a long journey and returns to his own country or city either on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
or on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of the week, this man entered the city during one
hour or a small portion of an hour, but everyone says, «So-and-so arrived on
the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the week» or «on the 3<sup>rd</sup>», and they
reckon the whole day which is one with the preceding night to his arrival. <A NAME="p420"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|420</SPAN></A>
And therefore, they say, we should on this principle regard the period of the
three days' burial, and the descent of our God and Saviour who became incarnate
into Sheol, as beginning from the time when he truly entered the heart of the
earth; and that he did after he gave up his spirit, saying, «My Father, into
thy hands I commit my spirit» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1096"><SUP>1096</SUP></A>, and then his spirit departed, and
thus, though he was united in a perfect union, the soul and the body were
separated from one another, and through the burial of the body he does away
corruption in graves, and through the soul he is seen in the lower parts' of the
earth, and he released those who were bound in graves. Then it was therefore
that he entered the heart of the earth, when 'he went down', as Paul says, 'to
the lower parts of the earth' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1097"><SUP>1097</SUP></A>, that is to the lowest limits and to
the gloomy crowns (?) <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1098"><SUP>1098</SUP></A> in the earth; From the departure of the spirit
therefore the three day-and-nights are to be counted; and the departure took
place at the 9<sup>th</sup> hour of the preparation, when three hours of the day
remained. Since therefore the preparation is according to the custom handed down
in Scripture united with the preceding night, we reckon that our Lord spent the
whole of the day and the night of the preparation in the heart of the earth, and
then after sunset the sabbath begins and its <A NAME="p421"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|421</SPAN></A>
night, the day which the Jews honour by a cessation; and the whole of this
together with the following day which is joined to it our Lord spent in the
lower parts of the earth. But, when the sabbath had gone by, and had been
completed by the, setting of the sun, then began the night of the 1<sup>st </sup>day
of the week; and the night again and the day following it are to be reckoned in
order according to that same custom of Scripture, and our Lord will be found to
have risen from the place of the dead on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day-and-night, that
of the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the week; for in fact one who passed the beginning
of a day-and-night in the heart of the earth is to be reckoned as having spent
the whole of that day-and-night there. For this reason they say that Christ
spent the preparation in the lower parts of the earth as regards the last
portion of the day-and-night, and the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the week as regards
the first portion, and the sabbath entirely through all the 24 hours, keeping
the day of the Jews' feast in mourning, that thereby also he might fulfil the
prophecy spoken through the prophet Amos, which threatens the Jews and says, «I
will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into wailing»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1099"><SUP>1099</SUP></A>.
But those men say also that the three hours' darkness which took place is
reckoned to be a night, and this is forced; for this darkness is not a night, <A NAME="p422"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|422</SPAN></A>
but an affliction of day; and they say that they are prevented from holding
anything of the kind by the prophecy of Zechariah also, who prophesies about
that day as follows: «On that day there shall be no light, and cold and frost
shall be one day, and that day shall be known to the Lord, neither day nor
night, and towards evening there shall be light» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1100"><SUP>1100</SUP></A>. See! the prophet
plainly says, «On that day there shall be no light», and, having first plainly
named the darkness, he prevented such an affliction and the light which rose
afterwards from being reckoned a night and a day by saying «neither day nor
night»; and this he says plainly, in order that no one may reckon this a day
and a night. As to the statement, «Cold and frost shall be one day», it is
not unreasonable for us to understand it to mean that there was actually
sensible cold and frost on that day; and supra-sensually that, because at a
certain time fiery fervour had grown cold among the Jews, the grace of the Holy
Spirit ceased to work among them <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1101"><SUP>1101</SUP></A>.<i> </i>This also besides we
should know, that our Lord in the gospels sometimes said<sup> </sup>that he was
destined to rise on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day, and sometimes that he would rise
after three days, the expression signifying that even the beginning of the 3<sup>rd</sup>
day is reckoned a whole day. <A NAME="p423"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|423</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p>[519-38.] For<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1103"><SUP>1103</SUP></A>, since they had a mind in contact with earthly
things, they said, <A NAME="p424"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|424</SPAN></A> «Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary?»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1104"><SUP>1104</SUP></A>;

and, «For good deeds we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, that, being a man,
thou makest thyself God»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1106"><SUP>1106</SUP></A>. Since therefore it was because they
stumbled at the dispensation in the flesh that they said these things, all the
blasphemies that they uttered against the Son of man, our Saviour said that they
should be forgiven to them; for they have as a defence ignorance of the mystery
and the condescension as man. «Therefore it shall be forgiven to men and not to
you», as if he were saying, «I give forgiveness as to men who have not known
the depth of the dispensation». But the things which they said in blasphemy
against the divine signs and mighty works which he did and performed by the
Spirit that was in him and of his nature (as he said, «I by the Spirit of God
cast out the demons»), «In Beelzebub» (as they say) «he casts out the demons»,
these things (he says) as things which are concerned with blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit and have from the acts <A NAME="p425"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|425</SPAN></A>
themselves the quality of God-befittingness <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1107"><SUP>1107</SUP></A> and have no room for
defence Christ said should not be forgiven <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1108"><SUP>1108</SUP></A>. But this blasphemy
against the Son of man shall be forgiven, and it is smaller than the blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit, down to the time of the Cross, we must understand,
because down to that time Christ obscured the greatness of his Godhead by means
of the words and actions of the dispensation; but after the Cross and the
Resurrection <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1109"><SUP>1109</SUP></A> he did so no longer; since the dispensation had once

<p>[519-38.] You should know that the priest who offers represents the great God
and our Saviour Jesus Christ; for he in fact celebrates the memory of the
sacrifice which he himself instituted, and of that which he himself began in the
mysterious supper.
</p>
<p>The veil therefore which before the priest approaches hides what is set forth
and is removed after his entry manifestly cries by the mouth of the facts
themselves that the mystery, which was previously concealed by means of the
sacrifices of the law and the shadowy service, and was obscurely made known as
it were by an indication only, by means of this spiritual and rational priestly
ministration reveals Christ who is God to those who have believed on him. <A NAME="p427"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|427</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To this refer also the words which Paul uses in the epistle to the
Corinthians, «The veil remaineth upon the readers of the Old Testament, and it
is not revealed because <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1112"><SUP>1112</SUP></A> it is done away in Christ»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1113"><SUP>1113</SUP></A>; since Christ
has indeed done away or has removed the veil by means of the service and
ministration in the Spirit, as is further stated by Paul himself, «We all with
open face see the glory of the Lord as in a mirror» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1114"><SUP>1114</SUP></A>. For what is
done with the veil shows according to a simple explanation that things that are
hidden from and not [seen] by those who initiate, these are manifest and visible
to those who believe and are initiated. [In] Palestine and in Jerusalem, while
the priest makes the said <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1115"><SUP>1115</SUP></A> prayer, the deacons frequently and
ceaselessly lift [the cover] <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1116"><SUP>1116</SUP></A> up and let it down again, until the end
of the prayer, and so after that the priest begins the petition over the
offering of the sacrifice. Further what is done in this fashion reminds us of
that veil or linen sheet which came down from heaven upon Peter, which contained all the
quadrupeds
and reptiles, and birds clean and unclean, and signified to him that <A NAME="p428"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|428</SPAN></A>
the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out not only on the people of Israel
which was clean, because it received God's law, but upon all the nations which
were without the law and unclean.
</p>
<p>For this reason therefore the cloth that is laid upon what is set forth on
the altar shows by being lifted and lowered the abundant and perfect gift of the
divine Spirit, which was shown to Peter by the vision to have included all the
nations, which descends from heaven upon [all] that is set forth, and
consecrates and hallows it.....<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1117"><SUP>1117</SUP></A>

<p>[519-38(?)] For we have already said that those who became founders of these
evil heresies find fault with the Old Testament <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1121"><SUP>1121</SUP></A>, and put forward the
New, some adding to it, others mutilating it; men whom the apostle Jude accuses
through the words stated as men who speak (?) <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1122"><SUP>1122</SUP></A>
great swollen words of
railing, which he also called their shame which comes after <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1123"><SUP>1123</SUP></A>
it. But
Michael the archangel who was then contending with the devil, when he was
speaking about Moses' body, did not dare to bring a railing accusation, but
said, «The Lord rebuke thee» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1124"><SUP>1124</SUP></A>, which seems to me to convey the
following meaning. The law which was given through Moses showed all the things
that relate to the cleansing of the soul and its justification <A NAME="p431"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|431</SPAN></A>
by means of bodily types and indications. Such is the fact that it passes
judgment upon the body of a leper as unclean, and similarly also upon a man with
an issue; for God does not exact punishment for involuntary afflictions, but by
means of these things annuls the stain of sin which is diverse and hard to wash
away, by which the soul is in divers manners stained. After this pattern
therefore he judges it pollution that the man should be dissipated on pleasures
who begets fruits for the benefit of the rational and intelligent soul <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1125"><SUP>1125</SUP></A>;
and here therefore God further showed by a bodily type a certain mystery that
happens to the soul. Since, when the soul is separated from the body after the
release from this world, the angelic and good hosts and a company of evil demons
meet it, in order that, according to the quality of the deeds which it has
performed bad or good, either the one or the other may convey it to the proper
regions to be kept till the last day, on which, we shall all rise, either to
judgment or to eternal life, or shall be brought to the unending flame of the
fire, therefore, because God wished <A NAME="p432"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|432</SPAN></A>
to show this to the sons of Israel by some bodily type, he caused the burial
of Moses to appear before their eyes at the time of the swathing <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1126"><SUP>1126</SUP></A>
of
the body and at: the customary deposition in the earth, as if the evil demon
were opposing and, Michael the good angel were, acting contrary to him. who met
him and drove him away, and did not authoritatively rebuke him, but yielded the
judgment against that demon to the Lord of all, and said, «The Lord rebuke thee»,
that by means of these things those who are being instructed may learn that that
the soul has a contest after the release from this world, and that we must by
means of good deeds pre'pare ourselves in order that angelic help may come to us
when the demons gnash their teeth enviously and bitterly at us. And, when this
sight had appeared before the eyes, then there fell in that place a ray of light
of a cloud that darkened and obstructed the sight of those who were standing on
this side and that, that no man might know his grave. Therefore the Holy
Scripture says in Deuteronomy also: «Moses the Lord's bondman ended his life
there, in the land of Moab, by the word of the Lord; and they buried him there
in <A NAME="p433"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|433</SPAN></A> the land of Moab beside the house of Peor, and no man hath known the end or
his grave to this day» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1127"><SUP>1127</SUP></A>; which is also confirmed by that which the
evangelist wrote <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1128"><SUP>1128</SUP></A>, since Luke one of the evangelists said in the
story of the rich man and Lazarus, «And it happened that the poor man also
died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1129"><SUP>1129</SUP></A>. These
same details labout the burial of Moses men have stated to be contained in an
apocrypha Book the more succinct title of which is 'The book of Generation or of
Creation, which Moses himself wrote for us' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1130"><SUP>1130</SUP></A>. And to us this seems to
be the interpretation of what he propounded, so that I thus understand it. But
some have said that Jude calls the law itself the body of Moses; and, when he
came down to show this to the sons of Israel, the devil opposed, and he worked
in opposition retarding the gift of the law, and contending and saying, «The
people does not deserve this to be done for them»; and therefore Michael went
before him and drove away him who opposed, uttering the rebuke, «The Lord
rebuke thee». And others <A NAME="p434"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|434</SPAN></A> again: «He calls the people whom he was leading the body of Moses; and he
meant that, when they were leaving the land of Egypt, the devil opposed and
resisted, as if he were saying in contention with Moses, «His body (which is
the people) does not deserve deliverance from Egypt to be given to it». And
this devil when he was opposing Michael put in bonds, and he reproved him
saying, «The Lord rebuke thee».

<p>[519-38.] «Thus saith the Lord: 'I found a hot one in the wilderness with
the slain of the sword. Go and destroy not Israel. The Lord shall be revealed
upon him afar off. With perfect love I loved thee; therefore I drew thee with
mercy. Again I will build thee and thou shalt be built, virgin Jerusalem'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1131"><SUP>1131</SUP></A>.
Certain men with experience of war say that generals of <A NAME="p435"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|435</SPAN></A>
armies have a custom of bringing besides the armed forces physicians also,
and, after the hosts engage with one another and the battle is joined, and the
opposite side is defeated, they send the physicians to search among the fallen,
and examine carefully lest there be found a man among them who is warm and has
breath in him, and may by medical skill recover from the deadly wounds that are
upon him. Therefore also the purport of this figurative prophecy which we have
cited is that, when Israel was reckoned with the dead, he restored him to life;
but some have not discovered the meaning contained in this figure, or the
explanation of the words, 'I found a hot one in the wilderness', but have given
a foolish interpretation. They changed the reading 'hot', and instead of saying
'hot' said 'solitary', and supposed from this that there is some herb which
grows of itself in the wilderness, and signifies the solitariness of Israel. For
it is not so. The words of the following context refute and truly banish their
supposition; and the words of Scripture are as follows: «I found a hot one in
the wilderness with the slain of the sword». So therefore I also am in this
manner lifted up, and am constrained to take courage and speak a few words about
the communications that have been addressed to me by your eloquent wisdom. <A NAME="p436"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|436</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p align="center"><i>(And after other things.)</i>
</p>
<p>But that our Lord Jesus Christ our God was pierced in the side with a lance
by that soldier after he gave up the ghost, and blood and water came
forth from it in a miraculous manner, the divine John the Evangelist recorded,
and no one else wrote about this. But certain persons have clearly falsified the
Gospel of Matthew and inserted this same passage, when the contrary is the fact,
in order to show that it was while he was alive that the soldier pierced his
side with the spear, and afterwards he gave up the ghost <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1132"><SUP>1132</SUP></A>. This
question was examined with great carefulness when my meanness was in the royal
city, at the time when the affair of Macedonius was being examined, who became
archbishop of that city, and there was produced the Gospel of Matthew, which was
written in large letters, and was preserved with great honour in the royal
palace, which was said to have been found in the days of Zeno of honourable
memory in a city of the island of Cyprus buried with the holy Barnabas, who went
about with Paul and spread the divine preaching; and, when the Gospel of Matthew
was opened, it was found to be free from the falsification contained in this
addition, <A NAME="p437"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|437</SPAN></A> of the story of the soldier and the spear. I do not know how and for what
reason the holy John who became bishop of the same royal city, and the admirable
Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, did not test this question, and allowed the two
passages to stand, in the two evangelists, neglecting the evidence to the
contrary;<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1133"><SUP>1133</SUP></A> but perhaps in order that this also might be known, that,
while they speak and write everything under the operation of the Holy Spirit,
and while these men are higher than we (for we are men who creep along the
earth), as the heaven is higher than the earth<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1134"><SUP>1134</SUP></A>, and that they
themselves also might be known to be men, and to leave omniscience to God only,
and that there is something in affairs which cannot be expressed, the complete
revelation of which is not made known. Thus Samuel also, who as one may say saw
with the eye of prophecy everything that was about to happen, did not know Saul
when he was present and standing among all Israel, Because God by means of these
things was instructing his bondmen, and teaching them to pay regard to humility.
Wherefore also the divine Scripture is written thus: «And Samuel asked in the
Lord and said, 'Cometh that man hither?' And the Lord said, ' Lo! he is hidden
among the vessels'. And <A NAME="p438"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|438</SPAN></A> he ran and took him thence»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1135"><SUP>1135</SUP></A>. And at the time when the Shilumite
woman's son died, and she had come to Elisha in great distress, as a mother who
had been deprived of her beloved son, and, when she had just fallen at the feet
of the prophet of God, and Gehazi tried to prevent her, the bondman of God,
being moved by love and sorrow, said to Gehazi, «Let her alone, because her
soul is bitter in her, and the Lord hid it from me and showed it not to me»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1136"><SUP>1136</SUP></A>.
Accordingly you should know that Eusebius of Caesarea also who is called
'Pamphili', who wrote the canons of the gospel, and imitated those who wrote on
this subject before him, and had more complete knowledge of this question than
the others, in the 10<sup>th</sup> canon, in which he recorded the places
peculiar to one of the evangelists, inserted this passage also about the soldier
and the lance, saying that John alone recorded it <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1137"><SUP>1137</SUP></A>. And we also
agree with this careful accuracy, not that we contend against our fathers (far
be it!), but that we place the evangelists at a greater height than them, and
assign to the evangelists only the intention which properly belongs to them, in
order that in everything Jesus, who is God, who spoke in the <A NAME="p439"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|439</SPAN></A>
evangelists, may be glorified, 'in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge hidden' <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1138"><SUP>1138</SUP></A>, according to the saying of Paul. But for the
rest we find that the holy John himself also, the bishop of Constantinople, in
the commentary on the same Matthew the Evangelist with regard to this same
addition which we are now discussing, himself also said things that fit the
truth; for he expressed himself thus: «'But another came up and perforated his
side with a lance'. And what could be more wicked than these men? And who could
be lawless like them? And who could be more savage than these same men, who
showed their madness to such an extent, that they attacked a dead body. But do
you mark how their madness was brought about for our salvation. For after the
wound the fountain of life welled forth for us» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1139"><SUP>1139</SUP></A>. But these are the
words of a man who follows the footsteps of the narrative of John the Evangelist
and nothing else; for he called the body 'dead'; because it was after he gave up
the ghost that the soldier pierced him, and gave occasion for the fountain of our salvation to well
forth thence, as the doctor John the bishop said. But this addition to the
narrative of Matthew the Evangelist has never been inserted by any of the earlier
<A NAME="p440"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|440</SPAN></A> commentators who wrote, not by Origen, who examined such questions minutely,
though he sinned <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1140"><SUP>1140</SUP></A> in matters that are necessary for the truth of the
faith of the church, nor by Didymus, nor by any other man who has written on
this subject. But Eusebius <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1141"><SUP>1141</SUP></A> of Caesarea, who is called 'Pamphili',
whom we mentioned a little above, when writing to a man called Marinus about
questions concerning the passions of our Saviour and about his Resurrection,
showed us nothing whatever about the said addition, as being unknown and having
no place in the books of the gospel. But in the same letters to Marinus, who had
asked him for an interpretation on the subject of our Saviour's passions and his
Resurrection, he inserted the following exposition also in his letters, that the
divine Mark the Evangelist said that it was the 3<sup>rd</sup> hour at the time
when Christ who is God and our Saviour was crucified, but the divine John (he
said) wrote that it was at the 6<sup>th</sup> hour that Pilate sat upon his
judgment-seat at the place called 'the pavement', and judged Christ. And
therefore Eusebius said that this is an error of a scribe, who was inattentive
when writing <A NAME="p441"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|441</SPAN></A> the Gospel. For it is the letter <i>gamal </i>that denotes 3 hours, while the
letter which is called in Greek <i>episemon </i>denotes the number of 6 hours,
and these letters are like one another in Greek, and, the scribe wishing to
write '3' quickly, and having turned the letter a little backwards, it was
thereby found to be '6', because, since the letter had been turned backwards, it
was supposed to be the letter that denotes '6'. Since therefore the three other
evangelists Matthew, Mark, and Luke stated alike as with one mouth that from the
6<sup>th</sup> hour to the 9<sup>th</sup> there was darkness over all the land,
it is plain that our Lord and God Jesus Christ was crucified before the 6<sup>th</sup>
hour, at which the darkness took place, that is from the 3<sup>rd</sup> hour, as
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1142"><SUP>1142</SUP></A> the blessed John himself wrote. Similarly we say that it is the 3<sup>rd</sup>
hour, because those who wrote before, as we have said, changed the letter. We
must insert also in this our letter upon this matter a part of what Eusebius
himself stated at length; and his words are as follows: «We agree not with any
chance man, but with the evangelist who gave this testimony, <A NAME="p442"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|442</SPAN></A>
Mark. For it happened that there was an error on the part of the scribe so
that he changed the letter by adding length to it, and it was thought that the
letter which represents '3' was '6', on account of the likeness of the two
letters [of that which denotes '3' and that which denotes '6'. If the refore it
is stated by John that it was the preparation of the day of unlevened bread, and
it was about the 6<sup>th</sup> hour, and Pilate said to the Jews «Behold! your
king» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1143"><SUP>1143</SUP></A>, and so on, let there be read instead of '6<sup>th</sup>' '3<sup>rd</sup>',
since the beginning of his trial took place at that time, and in the middle of
the hour or after it had been completed they crucified him, so that the result
is that they judged and crucified him at the same hour» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1144"><SUP>1144</SUP></A>; If you
look for and find the volume addressed to Marinus about the interpretation of
these things, you will find the accuracy of the writer as regards these matters.
For our part we do not wish to write much on these subjects in this our letter.
May the industry of your holiness be preserved for us meditating on these things
and occupied with these things in priestly fashion, and rousing up the gloom of
our silence and urging it to speak <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1145"><SUP>1145</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p443"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|443</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p>[513-8 (?).] For against that contention we must vigorously make answer, that in
<A NAME="p445"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|445</SPAN></A> the composition or fashioning of man the rational soul of man is not created
before the body, nor is the body formed before the soul. Why do you drag the teaching of the holy fathers which says that the divine inspiration is
the Holy Spirit, an active and operative force, and is the power which makes the soul of man, to an abominable objection by saying this, that they who
say this absolutely and by all means clearly hold that the body is created first, and after the formation is complete receives a soul, in that the Holy
Scripture says, «And God created man dust from the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1151"><SUP>1151</SUP></A>, as if the formation comes
first, and the animation follows afterwards, in the second place, according to the narrative
of Scripture? But we shall not arrive at this cold supposition, if we receive in our mind that God creates, not like some feeble man. <i>(A little farther
on.) </i>It would perhaps be possible for us to adduce other testimonies also that
the human soul was created by divine inflation; but indeed this stands clear, that the holy Cyril taught all of them in his writings, showing that the soul
of man came into being by divine inflation, and again that we are to <A NAME="p446"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|446</SPAN></A>
understand that, man having been created and possessing a soul, the inflation
inserted only spiritual gifts and patterns of divine association.
</p>
<p>And the holy Basil in what he wrote about the Holy Spirit taught as follows:
«For, when Adam had lost the grace derived from the divine inflation, Christ
gave it back again, when he breathed into the face of his disciples and said,
'Receive the Holy Spirit'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1152"><SUP>1152</SUP></A>. And again he said, «When he breathed
in intellect, he is not another diifering from him who breathed at the
beginning, but the same through whom he gave the inflation, then giving it with
the soul, but now giving the soul». So much we have written as an abundant
elucidation of the words, «Let us make man in our image» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1153"><SUP>1153</SUP></A>, and of
the words, «breathed into his face the breath of life».

these things by way of giving instruction and teaching in the direction of
humility (for the gifts of the Spirit are not scanty or defective), and it was
not because he took away some of the spirit that was upon Moses that he filled
others with this. For the whole of it was both with the recipients and with him,
just as one may also see in the nature of fire. When a man has lighted several <A NAME="p448"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|448</SPAN></A>
torches from one torch, he has not diminished the one, and yet has from it
caused many to be in equal honour. For the grace that was upon Moses appeared as
it were to be darkened by the fact that the seventy shared in the same honour
and prophesied in the Spirit. But this type was fulfilled by the future; for,
when after the coming of the Only one in the flesh the Spirit was poured out,
the grace that was upon Moses was darkened, and the fire of the torch of the
law, when brought near to the gospel, is extinguished by the all-brilliant rays
of the Sun of righteousness.

<p align="center"><i>(To John, Theodore, and John) </i><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1165"><SUP>1165</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>[519-38.] But he <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1166"><SUP>1166</SUP></A> says concerning what is written in Matthew, «Many
bodies of the saints who slept arose» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1167"><SUP>1167</SUP></A>: «For, if 'many', it is
plain that all did not; and, if 'saints', it is beyond controversy that those of
wicked men and. men who died in sins did not also rise».
</p>
<p>(<i>And a little farther on</i>.) For this also is the reason for which he
said that they 'appeared to many', to show the object for which they
rose, and through a thing that is manifest to make known something that is not
manifest, whom Christ's descent into Sheol benefited, viz. the saints who had
already purified their soul. For, when he went thither, he made proclamation to
the spirits in prison also who had aforetime been disobedient according to the
statement of the apostle Peter <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1168"><SUP>1168</SUP></A>. And to all alike he appeared, having
broken gates of bronze and shattered bars of iron as it is written <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1169"><SUP>1169</SUP></A>.
But all did not know him, nor benefit by his appearance, but those <A NAME="p452"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|452</SPAN></A>
only who lived uprightly, who also, if he had appeared to them while they
were still living the life in the flesh would certainly have believed on him. <i>(And
lower down.) </i>But that all did not rise at that time with Christ, nor all who
had died benefit by his descent into Sheol, although he himself appeared and
made proclamation to all alike, but those who had already purified their soul as
we have said, and therefore knew him and believed, Gregory the Theologian in the
sermon on the Passover handed down, after expanding the question as is proper in
what he added, writing thus <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1170"><SUP>1170</SUP></A>: «If he go down to Sheol go down with
him. Know the mysteries there, what is the economy of the double descent <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1171"><SUP>1171</SUP></A>,
what the principle. Does he simply save all by appearing, or there also those
who believe <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1172"><SUP>1172</SUP></A>?» And Ignatius the truly God-clad and martyr, who, or
some other man <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1173"><SUP>1173</SUP></A>, saw ineffable mysteries, so that he was even careful
to say of himself, and this with humble mind, «For I also in that I am hound
and am able to understand <A NAME="p453"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|453</SPAN></A> the heavenly things and the angelic locations, and the princely companies,
visible and again invisible, am not thereby a disciple» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1174"><SUP>1174</SUP></A>, in writing
to those at Magnesia said thus: «For the divine prophets lived in Jesus Christ;
therefore also they were persecuted, being inspired by his grace in order that
the incredulous might be persuaded that there is one God who revealed himself
through Jesus Christ his Son»; and a little further on: «How shall we able to
live without him? whom the prophets also, being his disciples in the spirit,
expected as a teacher, and therefore he whom they rightly awaited, when he came,
raised them from the place of the dead» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1175"><SUP>1175</SUP></A>. You see that those who
like the prophets lived in Jesus Christ, that is in justice and saintly deeds,
benefited by our Saviour's descent into Sheol; many of whose bodies arose, and
appeared for the confirmation only of the power of him who went down into the
lower parts of the earth as I said, not to give the recompense of the
resurrection that is promised to all together, on the day of the righteous
recompensing.
</p>
<p>(<i>And lower down</i>.) «For to this end it was preached to the dead also,
that <A NAME="p454"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|454</SPAN></A> they may be judged in the flesh as men, but live in God in the spirit»
<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1176"><SUP>1176</SUP></A>.
For it was not to the just, but chiefly to sinners and those sunk in
transgression that the gospel was proclaimed, that they might judge themselves,
humanly publishing a sentence against themselves and judging the flesh, and
bringing their soul into subjection by works of repentance and urging it to
escape from the divine judgment, since there is also fear of falling into the
hands of the living God <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1177"><SUP>1177</SUP></A>, in order that they might be judged in the
flesh as men (that is, that a man in mercy on his soul might judge himself), but
live in God in the spirit.

<p>[519-38.] But they are conscious of services and prayers, and especially
those that are made over the bloodless sacrifice on behalf of their life; and assuredly
<A NAME="p455"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|455</SPAN></A> some consolation results to them in proportion to the measure of each man's
character. And they are conscious too of alms given to the poor on their behalf;
for they also are a rational sacrifice as Paul teaches this and says, «To give
alms and to impart forget not; for such sacrifices please God»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1179"><SUP>1179</SUP></A>. For
that those who have fallen asleep in Christ are conscious of these things the
ritual also which was handed down to the churches from of old by the apostles
and from the beginning to the present day clearly witnesses; for the deacon
makes proclamation to those who are standing while the bloodless sacrifice is
being offered that they are to make supplication on behalf of those who have
fallen asleep, and on behalf of those on whose behalf they are making
commemorations and alms. But it is not lawful for us to say that any of the
things enjoined in the holy churches is useless or vain.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Of the same holy Severus, from the same 20<sup>th</sup> hypomnestikon.</i>
</p>
<p>From the God-inspired Scripture we learn that in the resurrection both the
just shall see the just and the sinners the sinners; but the just also <A NAME="p456"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|456</SPAN></A>
shall see the sinners who have conducted themselves in a manner opposite to
their own being sent to the endless torments, and the sinners also shall gaze
from afar at the righteous who have been injured by them enjoying pleasures. And
this is a kind of punishment which they will bear in addition to their torments
in the pains, that of being tormented by remorse, and then they will know from
what good things they have fallen. These things the Lord taught us in the gospel
as in an image and type delineated beforehand, by means of the parable of
Lazarus and the rich man. Lazarus, having been justified by endurance in the
distresses of poverty, was known by righteous Abraham, and was resting in his
bosom; and the rich man also when judgment was being exacted from him for his
sins, and his mercilessness towards Lazarus, while he was in the flame that is
not quenched, from afar saw and knew Lazarus. This the Book of Wisdom also
shows, in that it clearly depicts the wicked as knowing on the day of judgment
the just who have been set at naught and evil entreated by them; and it speaks
thus: «And they shall come to perception of their sins in fear; and their
iniquity shall stand up against them and reprove them. Then shall the just man
stand up with great boldness against the face of those who afflicted him and
spurned his labour. They shall see <A NAME="p457"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|457</SPAN></A>
and be troubled with sore fear, and they shall be amazed at the greatness of
his salvation. And repenting in their soul they shall say, and in affliction of
spirit they shall groan and say, 'This was he who was then to us fools for a
derision and a parable and a reproach. His life we counted folly, and his death
contemptible. How is it that he hath been counted among the sons of God and his
inheritance is with the saints? Did we then err from the way of truth, and did
the light of justice not shine upon us?'» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1180"><SUP>1180</SUP></A> Lo! therefore they of
whom we speak, who were friends to one another with the evil friendship that is
of perdition, on the last day at the judgment shall recognise one another, and
the just man, whom in this world they senselessly set at naught and derided,
they shall see to have been counted among the sons of God and to be receiving
inheritance with the saints; and so thereafter they shall be separated, the one
party to the outer darkness as it is written <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1181"><SUP>1181</SUP></A>, or to the fire that is
not quenched, or to the gnashing of teeth and to the weeping and to the worm
that undyingly torments, and to judgments that are sent in such forms, and the
other to the blessed abodes in the kingdom of heaven. For the words «Let the
wicked man be taken away that he see not the glory of the Lord» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1182"><SUP>1182</SUP></A>
are
spoken with this meaning, that he shall not <A NAME="p458"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|458</SPAN></A>
share in the glory of the Lord that is given to his just ones. Though <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1183"><SUP>1183</SUP></A>
they shall not come lo judgment nor stand before the judgment-seat of Christ
according to what is stated by the psalmist: «Therefore the wicked shall not
stand in judgment»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1184"><SUP>1184</SUP></A>, yet still they will be aware what glory the
just are enjoying, and of what they themselves have been deprived on account of
their unbelief, in order that they may be tormented by this also. That it is the
custom of Scripture to use the expression 'see' in place of 'share' or 'have
experience' is made known by that which is stated by David also, «May the Lord
bless thee out of Zion, and mayest thou look upon the good things of Jerusalem»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1185"><SUP>1185</SUP></A>.
And Ezekiel the prophet shows that the grievous tyrants of the different peoples
and the soldiers with them, who did evil with one another and armed themselves
in sins, shall also be together in the eternal torments; for he said, «There is
Assyria, and all his concourse»; and again, «There is Elam and all his host»;
and further on, «There were given Moshach and Thubel, and all their host»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1186"><SUP>1186</SUP></A>.
But that those who have lived uprightly will know those whom they love in the
future life Isaiah <A NAME="p459"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|459</SPAN></A> the prophet clearly cries, in that he terms them deer, inasmuch as by means
of their struggles against passions they trampled upon serpents and scorpions,
and upon all the power of the the adversary (for a deer is a serpent-slaying
animal); for he said thus: «There the does met one another, and saw one
another's face. They passed over in number and none of them perished. They
sought not one another, because the Lord commanded them, and his spirit gathered
them»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1187"><SUP>1187</SUP></A>. And kinsmen shall know kinsmen, as the sacred Scripture
teaches us, saying of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob who died, in one place, «he
was added to his fathers», in another, «he was added to his kin», and again,
«he was added to his people»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1188"><SUP>1188</SUP></A>. And David the wise, who as a prophet
was initiated in and saw the future hope beforehand, when he had buried his son,
bathed and anointed himself, and changed his garments, and set out a table,
saying, «Wherefore do I fast? Shall I be able to bring him back any more? I
shall go to him, but he himself will not return to me»<A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1189"><SUP>1189</SUP></A>. He would
not suddenly have been converted from that mournful sorrow to such great
cheerfulness unless he had been assured that he should see the boy again living
in the resurrection. The <A NAME="p460"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|460</SPAN></A> doctors of the church, weaving words of consolation from these and similar
thoughts and from scriptural indications, persuaded fathers and mothers who were
mourning beyond measure that in the resurrection they would see and receive
their children who had died, and in like manner kinsmen and friends.

Vivian <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1192"><SUP>1192</SUP></A> answered and said, «And in order to reconcile four or five
monasteries to yourself you will dissolve the whole unity of the churches». The

<p>The rod which was cleft <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1194"><SUP>1194</SUP></A> divided the indivisible sea and the sun
saw land which had never seen it; and it whelmed the iniquitous foeman in the
water of the deep, and Israel passed through by a road that had not been

gloriously splendid and glorious» <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1195"><SUP>1195</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>Who is able and sufficient as is meet to praise thy triumphs, O saintly and
blessed Severus? For they overcome and surpass all intelligence and reason and
knowledge. Thee Christ raised up as a champion of the orthodox faith, Christ
whom also thou didst praise 'for he is gloriously splendid and glorious'. <A NAME="p463"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|463</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Since thou first receivedst the seal of light, thou didst never consent to
defile this by the lusts of the world, but straightway betookest thyself to the
life of asceticism and didst commune with Christ the King, the Saviour of all
created things, whom also thou didst praise 'for he is gloriously splendid and
glorious'.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>My heart hath been strengthened.</i>
</p>
<p>Thou art the strength and confirmation of them that hope in thee. Lord of
all,<i> </i>thou art the light of them that are in darkness and to thee my
spirit maketh confession without ceasing.
</p>
<p>Thou art the strength of the truth, thou art the sound prop. Thou art the
pillar and the foundation of the churches and we honour the day of thy
commemoration.
</p>
<p>Thou didst raise up and confirm the right faith in the churches which were
torn by heresies, our father, and we honour the day of thy commemoration.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Lord, I have heard.</i>
</p>
<p>Thou rodest in procession upon horses which are those who please thee, <A NAME="p464"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|464</SPAN></A>
Lord of all, and with strength thou didst hold these reins in thine hands and
they became as it were a great salvation in that comeliness becometh (?) <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1196"><SUP>1196</SUP></A>
them that cry in faith «Praise to the might of thy being, Lord of all».
</p>
<p>That wolf once attacked as one that is bold when Justinian overthrew and
expelled the party of the orthodox; but Severus opposed him in the mind of the
Lord, and by the shafts of his words rescued and saved the flock that was being
despoiled.
</p>
<p>Thou didst set up and strengthen the right teachings of the faith without
blame, having thrust away alike the cleavage and the confusion of those who
foolishly dared io divide or confound, in that thou taughtest us rightly to
proclaim the doctrine of one incarnate nature.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>In the night my soul.</i>
</p>
<p>Give light to us all, Lord, by thy life-giving commands, and, leading us with
thine exalted arm, grant thy peace to our souls, merciful one.
</p>
<p>Supplicate, saintly one, on behalf of the members of the holy church, that <A NAME="p465"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|465</SPAN></A>
they may quickly in mercy be at peace and be united, and through thy prayer
be delivered from the assaults of heresies.
</p>
<p>Arise saintly one now also to defend the flock which hath fled to thee for
refuge, and restrain by the might of thy prayer the treacherous wolves of all
the heresies, who are howling to break it in pieces, and make them cease from
it.
</p>
<p>Thou confessedst the incarnate Word to be one hypostasis. and nature only,
that was in no wise divided or changed; and therefore the believers zealously
honour the day of thy commemoration.
</p>
<p align="center">«<i>I</i> <i>cried unto the Lord»</i>  <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1197"><SUP>1197</SUP></A></sup>.
</p>
<p>I pour out my prayer before God, and to him I reveal and declare my distress,
because my soul hath been filled with evil things, and my very life hath
approached and reached Sheol. Lift me up from destruction, my God, like Jonah from beneath the sea and save me.
</p>
<p>Thou passedst wisely through the grievous storm of this perturbed world,
holding the definition of the orthodox faith, and now in heaven thou dwellest
with the saints because thou showedst thyself a strenuous defender of the
teachings that are full of life, O blessed one. <A NAME="p466"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|466</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In knowledge and in a life of virtue, as in these two things <A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1198"><SUP>1198</SUP></A>
thou didst glitter and shine brightly, while thou wast eminent in all things,
and didst urge all nations to come to the faith and diligently admonish everyone
with thy sound words, O blessed one.
</p>
<p align="center">«<i>Blessed art thou»</i><sup><A HREF="severus_coll_3_letters_fn.html#1199"><SUP>1199</SUP></A></sup>.
</p>
<p>Once that tyrant commanded and provided the furnace to be heated in the plain
of Dura to burn those who feared God, the furnace in which the three boys,
having been made like to the one God, uttered a triple song of praise and said,
«God of our saintly fathers, blessed art thou»<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>When Marcian once set up the evil invocation of two natures to overthrow the
orthodox, thereby, our father, thou becamest more illustrious in that thou didst
urge and teach all men to cry and say, «God of our saintly fathers, blessed art
thou».
</p>
<p>Thou showedst thyself an approved one among the doctors, O saintly Severus,
and with them thou didst profess and proclaim and fill the world with the right
doctrines and saidst, «The Son, the Word who became <A NAME="p467"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|467</SPAN></A>
incarnate, is one nature and hypostasis» and taughtest us to cry and to say, «God
of our saintly fathers, blessed art thou».

bush figured beforehand and showed to Moses by a miracle the mystery of the
Virgin, the Lord of all, and exalt him without ceasing for ever and ever.
</p>
<p>Praise him who bestowed such a luminary upon his church, one who stood forth
as an advocate of the right doctrines, and in all his contests was shown as
victor, the Lord of all.
</p>
<p>Thou becamest a teacher of the apostolic faith, and a subverter of the heresy
that is full of impiety, thou who didst never divide Christ the Son, but who
didst confess him. Praise the Lord of all.
