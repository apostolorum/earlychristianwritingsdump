<b>PREFACE TO THE ONLINE EDITION</b>
</P>
<hr>
<p>I have placed online the text of J.H. Freese' English translation of codices
1-165.&nbsp; This was published in 1920, but no further volumes ever appeared.&nbsp;
This text is now in the public domain.</p>
<p>The remainder has not been translated into English, with the exception of
selected codices by N.G. Wilson in 1994.&nbsp; The whole has been translated
into French by René Henry -- not very well, according to Wilson.</p>
<p>I am purely an amateur interested in antiquity.&nbsp; I had the good
fortunate to do some Latin at school; sadly Greek even in the 1970's was no
longer part of the curriculum.&nbsp; So I am unable to translated the Greek text
myself.&nbsp; In the last 5 centuries there must have been millions of
English-speakers with a command of Greek, but none of them have ever chosen to
perform the task.</p>
<p>From time to time, I am asked what the French text of Henry says by persons
who are interested.&nbsp; These people like myself lack Greek, and have even
less command of French than myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there would be value in placing my translations of Henry
online.&nbsp; Les Belles Lettres have kindly agreed to my request for permission
to do this.&nbsp; Material derived from Henry is therefore their copyright, and
marked as such, and may not be placed elsewhere.&nbsp; I have also modified the
text in some places from Wilson, from the Greek, and from the Latin translation
in the Patrologia Graeca.</p>
<p> I hope no-one will be so ungracious as to point
out the wretched nature of this performance.&nbsp; None know it better than
myself.&nbsp; But when those who could do the task will not, then those of us
whose only qualification is a willingness to try must fill up the gap.&nbsp;
Needless to say, corrections are very welcome!&nbsp; Should anyone feel inclined
to do some translating from the Greek (or even from Henry), such contributions
would be very welcome.&nbsp; The intention is to make the work better known,
less cited, and more often read.</p>
