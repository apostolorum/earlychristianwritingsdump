<h3 align=center>THE  ACTS OF<br>
JUDAS THOMAS (OR THE TWIN)<br>
THE APOSTLE.</h3>

<p align=center>----&nbsp;</p>

<p align=center>The (first) act of Judas Thomas
the Apostle, when He sold him to the merchant Habb&#257;n, that he might go
down (and) convert India.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>

<p>AND when all the Apostles had been for a
time in Jerusalem, — Simon Cephas and Andrew, and Jacob (James) and John, and 
Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew the publican, and Jacob (James)
the son of Alphæus, and Simon the Kananite, and Judas the son of Jacob
(James),—they divided the countries among them, in order that each one of them
might preach in the region which fell to him and in the place to which his Lord
sent him. And India fell by lot and division to Judas Thomas <i>(or </i>the
Twin) the Apostle. And he was not willing to go, saying: &quot;I have not
strength enough for this, because I am weak. And I am a Hebrew: how can I teach
the Indians?&quot; And whilst Judas was reasoning thus, our Lord appeared to
him in a vision of the night, and said to him: &quot; Fear not, Thomas, because
my grace is with thee.&quot; But he would not be persuaded at all, saying: 
&quot;Whithersoever Thou wilt, our Lord, send me; only to India I will not
go.&quot; And as Judas was reasoning thus, a certain merchant, an Indian, happened
(to come) into the south country from——,whose name was Habb&#257;n; and he was
sent by the king G&#363;dnaphar, that he might bring to him a skilful
carpenter.   And our Lord saw him walking in the street, and said to him:
&quot; Thou wishest to buy a carpenter?&quot; He saith to him, &quot;Yes.&quot;
Our Lord saith to him: &quot;I have a slave, a carpenter, whom I will sell to
thee.&quot; And he showed him Thomas at a distance, and bargained with him for
twenty (pieces) of silver (as) his price, and wrote a bill of sale thus: 
&quot;I, Jesus, the son of Joseph the carpenter, from the village of Bethlehem,
which is in Judæa, acknowledge, that I have sold my slave Judas Thomas to
Habb&#257;n, the merchant of king Gudnaphar.&quot; And when they had completed
his bill of sale, Jesus took Judas, and went to Habb&#257;n the merchant.   And
Habb&#257;n saw him, and said to him: &quot;Is this thy master?&quot; Judas
saith to him: &quot;Yes, he is my master.&quot; Habb&#257;n the merchant saith
to, him: &quot;He has sold thee to me outright.&quot; And Judas was silent.</p>

<p>And in the morning he arose and prayed,
and entreated of his Lord, and said to Him: &quot;Lo, our Lord, as Thou wilt,
let Thy will be (done).&quot; And he went to Habb&#257;n the merchant, without
carrying anything with him except that price of his, for our Lord had given it
to him. And Judas went and found Habb&#257;n the merchant carrying his goods on
board the ship, and he began to carry (them) on board with him. And when they
had gone on board and sat down, Habb&#257;n the merchant saith to Judas:
&quot;What is thy art which thou art skilled in practising?&quot; Judas saith
to him: &quot;Carpentering and architecture—the business of the carpenter.&quot;
Habban the merchant saith to him: &quot;What dost thou know to make in wood,
and what in hewn stone?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;In wood I have learned
to make ploughs and yokes and ox-goads, and oars for ferry-boats, and masts for
ships; and in stone, tombstones and monuments, and temples, and palaces for
kings.&quot; Habb&#257;n the merchant saith to him: &quot;And I was seeking
just such an artificer.&quot; And they began to sail, because the breeze was
steady; and they were sailing along gently, until they put in at the town of
Sandaruk.</p>

<p>And when they had disembarked on the land,
and were entering and going into the city, they heard the sound of pipes and
organs and much singing. And Judas was asking and saying: &quot;What is the rejoicing
that is in this city?'' They say to him: &quot;Thee too have the gods brought
that thou mayest be glad in this city; for the king has an only daughter, and
he is giving her to a man; and this sound of rejoicing is that of the wedding-feast.
And heralds have been permitted by the king to proclaim, that every one should
come to the feast, both poor and rich, and slaves and freemen, and strangers
and citizens. And every one who does not come to the feast, is in danger of the
anger of the king.&quot; The merchant Habb&#257;n saith to Judas:  &quot;Let us
too go, that we may not be spoken ill of, especially as we are strangers.&quot;
And when they had stopped at an inn and rested a little, they went to attend
the feast. And Judas reclined in the middle, and they were all looking upon him
as upon a stranger, who came from another place. And the merchant Habb&#257;n,
his master, was reclining in another place.</p>

<p>And when they ate and drank, Judas was
tasting nothing at all. Those who were beside him say to him: &quot;Why art
thou come hither, since thou art not able to eat or to drink?&quot; Judas saith
to them: &quot;For something that is better than eating or drinking, am I come
hither; and for the king's rest, and that I might accomplish his will; and
because the heralds were proclaiming, that he who hears and does not come,
shall receive chastisement.&quot; And when they had eaten and drunk, both oil
and dried fruits were brought in to them, and they took (thereof). Some were
anointing their faces, others their beards, and others other places; but Judas
was praising, God, and signing the middle of his head (with the Cross); and he
moistened his nostrils with a little (of the oil), and put (some) in his  ears,
and made the sign (of the Cross) over his heart; and a garland of myrtle was
placed on his head, and he took a reed-branch in his hand.</p>

<p>Then the flute-girl, who was in the midst
of the party, was going round to them all; and when she came to Judas, she was
standing and playing over him. And the flute player was a Hebrew (woman).</p>

<p>And when she had stood over him a long
time, Judas did not lift up his face, but was looking all the while on the
ground. And one of the cup-bearers came, (and) raised his hand and smote him on
his cheek. And Judas looked at him and said to him: &quot;My God will forgive
thee this in the world to come, but in this world He will show His wonders on
the hand which smote me, and I shall see it dragged along by a dog.&quot; And
Judas began to sing this song.</p>

<p>&quot;My Church is the daughter of light;
the splendour of kings is hers. Charming and winsome is her aspect, fair and
adorned with every good work. Her garments are like unto flowers, the smell
whereof is fragrant and pleasant. On her head dwelleth the King, and He feedeth
those who dwell with Him beneath. Truth is placed on her head, joy moves in her
feet. Her mouth is open, and it becometh her, wherewith she uttereth all songs
of praise.   The twelve Apostles of the Son, and the seventy-two (disciples)
thunder forth (His praises) in her. Her tongue is the curtain, which the priest
raiseth and entereth in. Her neck is the lofty flight of steps, which the first
architect did build. Her hands, both of them, proclaim (and point out) the
place of life; and her ten fingers have opened the gate of Heaven. Her bridal
chamber is lighted up, and full of the sweet odour of salvation. A censer is
ready in its midst, love and belief and hope, gladdening all; within, truth
(dwells) in humility. Her gates are adorned with truth; her groomsmen surround
her, all whom she hath invited; and her pure bridesmaids (go) before her,
uttering praise.    The living are in attendance upon her, and they look to
their Bridegroom who shall come, and they shall shine with His glory, and shall
be with Him  in  the kingdom which never passeth away.    And they shall be in
the glory to which all the just are gathered;   and they shall be in the joy
into which some enter; and they shall put on shining garments, and shall be
clothed with the glory of their Lord.    And they shall praise the living
Father, whose majestic light they have received, and have been enlightened by
the splendour of their Lord, of whose food they have received, which never hath
any excrement, and have drunk of the life which makes those who drink of it
long and thirst (for more); and have glorified the Father, the Lord of all, and
the only-(begotten) Son, who is of Him; and have praised the Spirit, His
Wisdom.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had sang this song, all who
were beside  him were looking at him, and were seeing that his aspect was
changed; but they could not at all understand what he was saying, because he
was speaking in Hebrew, and they did not know (it). But the flute-player had
heard everything, because she was a Hebrew (woman), and she was looking at him.
And when she left him and played to the others, she still kept looking at him,
and loved him as a countryman of hers; and in his looks he was more beautiful
than all those who were there. And when the flute-player had finished, she sat
down opposite to him and did not turn away her eyes from him; but he did not lift
up his eyes, and did not look at any one, but was ever looking upon the ground,
(waiting) till he might arise and depart from the banquet-room. And the
cup-bearer had gone down to the fountain to draw water, and a lion happened to
be there, and rent him and tore him limb from limb. Then the dogs were carrying
off his limbs singly; and a black dog carried off his right hand, which he had
raised against Judas, and brought it into the midst of the banquet-room.</p>

<p>And when they all saw it, they were
amazed. And when they were all asking which of them was lost, the hand was
found to be that of the cup-bearer who had smitten Judas. Then the flute-player
broke her flutes, and came to the feet of the Apostle, (and) sat down, and was
saying: &quot;This man is either God or the Apostle of God; for I heard him
(say) in Hebrew what he said to that cup-bearer, and immediately it befell him.
For he said to him, 'I shall see a dog dragging about the hand that smote me';
and lo, ye have seen how the dog dragged it about.&quot; And some of them
believed the flute-player, and some of them did not believe (her). And the
king, when he heard this story, came and said to Judas: &quot;Come with me, and
pray for my daughter, because she is my only one, and today I am giving her
away in marriage.&quot; And he did not wish to go with him, because our Lord
had not yet manifested Himself to him in that place. But the king carried him
off by force to the bridal chamber.</p>

<p>And he began to pray and to say thus:
&quot;Our Lord,— companion of His servants, and guide and conductor of those
who believe in Him, and refuge and repose of the afflicted, and hope of the
poor, and deliverer of the feeble, and healer of sick souls, life-giver of the
universe, and saviour of (all) creatures,—Thou knowest what things are going to
happen, and through us Thou accomplishest them. Thou art the discloser of
hidden secrets, and the revealer of mysterious sayings. Thou art the planter of
the good tree, and through Thy hands all acts take place. Thou art hidden in
all Thy works, and art manifested in their acts, Jesus, perfect Son of perfect
mercy; and Thou didst become the Messiah, and didst put on the first man. Thou
art the power, and the wisdom, and the knowledge, and the will, and the rest of
Thy Father, in whom Thou art concealed in glory, and in whom Thou art revealed
in Thy creative agency; and Ye are one with two names. And Thou didst manifest
Thyself as a feeble (being), and those who saw Thee, thought of Thee, that Thou
wast a man who had need of help. And Thou didst show the glory of Thy Godhead
in Thy longsuffering towards our manhood, when Thou didst hurl the evil (one)
from his power, and didst call with Thy voice to the dead, and they became
alive; and to those who were alive and hoping in Thee, Thou didst promise an
inheritance in Thy kingdom. Thou wast the ambassador, and wast sent from the
supernal heights, because Thou art able to do the living and perfect will of
Thy sender. Glorious art Thou, Lord, in Thy might; and Thy renovating
administration is in all Thy creatures, and in all the works which Thy Godhead
hath established; and no other is able to annul the will of Thy majesty, nor to
stand up against Thy nature as Thou art. And Thou didst descend to Sheol, and
go to its uttermost end; and didst open its gates, and bring out its prisoners,
and didst tread for them the path (leading) above by the nature of Thy Godhead.
Yea, Lord, I ask of Thee on behalf of these young people, that whatever Thou
knowest to be beneficial for them, Thou wilt do for them.&quot; And he laid his
hand upon them, and said to them: &quot;Our Lord be with you&quot;; and he left
them and went away.</p>

<p>And the king requested the groomsmen to go
out of the bridal chamber. And when all the people had gone out, and the door
of the bridal chamber was closed, the bridegroom raised up the curtain, that he
might bring the bride to himself. And he saw our Lord in the likeness of
Judas, who was standing and talking with the bride. And the bridegroom said to
him: &quot;Lo, thou didst go out first; how art thou still here?&quot; Our Lord
saith to him: &quot;I am not Judas, but I am the brother of Judas.&quot; And
our Lord sat down on the bed, and let the young people sit down on the chairs,
and began to say to them:—</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, my children, what my
brother spake with you, and know to whom he committed you; and know that as
soon as ye preserve yourselves from this filthy intercourse, ye become pure
temples, and are saved from afflictions manifest and hidden, and from the heavy
care of children, the end of whom is bitter sorrow. And if ye have children,
for their sakes ye will become oppressors and robbers and smiters of orphans
and wrongers of widows, and ye will be grievously tortured for their injuries.
For the greatest part of children are the cause of many pains; for either the
king falls upon them, or a demon lays hold of them, or paralysis befalls
them.    And if they be healthy, they come to ill either by adultery, or theft,
or fornication, or covetousness, or vain-glory; and through these wickednesses
ye will be tortured by them. But if ye will be persuaded by me, and keep
yourselves purely unto God, ye shall have living children, to whom not one of
these blemishes and hurts cometh nigh; and ye shall be without care and without
grief and without sorrow; and ye shall be hoping (for  the  time) when  ye 
shall see  the true wedding-feast; and ye shall be in it praisers (of God), and
shall be numbered with those who enter into the bridal chamber.&quot;</p>

<p>And the young people were persuaded by our
Lord, and gave up themselves to Him, and were preserved from filthy lust, and
passed the night in their places. And our Lord went forth from beside them, and
said to them: &quot;May the grace of your Lord be with you.&quot; And in the
morning, when it was dawn, the king had the table furnished early, and brought
in before the bridegroom and bride. And he found them sitting the one opposite
the other, and the face of the bride was uncovered and she was sitting, and the
bridegroom was very cheerful. The mother of the bride saith to her: &quot;Why
are thou sitting thus, and art not ashamed, but (art) as if, lo, thou wert
(married) along time and for many a day?&quot; And her father too said : &quot;
Because of thy great love for thy husband dost thou not even veil
thyself?&quot;</p>

<p>And the bride answered and saith to her:
&quot;Truly, my mother, I am in great love, and I am praying to my Lord that I
may continue in this love which I have experienced this night, and may call
for the incorruptible Bridegroom who has revealed Himself to me this night. And
that I am not veiled, (is) because the veil of corruption is taken away from
me; and that I am not ashamed, (is) because the deed of shame has been removed
far from me; and that I am not repentant, (is) because the repentance, which
restores to life, abides in me. And that I am cheerful and gay, (is) because,
in the day of this transitory joy, I am not agitated by it; and that this deed
of corruption is despised by me, and the spoils of this wedding-feast that
passes away, (is) because I am invited to the true wedding-feast; and that I
have not had intercourse with a husband, the end whereof is bitter repentance,
(is) because I am betrothed to the true Husband.&quot; And many things which
were like unto these was she saying.</p>

<p>Then too the bridegroom answered and said:
&quot;I praise Thee, (Thou) new God, who by means of a stranger hast come
hither. I glorify Thee, (Thou) God, who hast been preached by means of a Hebrew
man; who hast removed me from corruption, and hast sown in me life; who hast
delivered me from the disease that was abiding in me for ever; who hast
revealed to us Thyself, and I have perceived in what (state) I am; who hast
saved me from falling and hast led me on to a better state; who hast rescued me
from these transitory things, and hast deemed me worthy of those that are not
transitory; who hast let Thyself down even to my littleness, that Thou mightest
bring me unto Thy greatness ; who didst not withhold Thy mercy from me who was
lost, but didst show me (how) to seek for myself and to put away from me the
things that are not mine; who, when I did not know Thee, hast sought me Thyself;
who, when I did not perceive Thee, hast come unto me; whom I have now
perceived, and am not able to say anything which I do not know; against whom 'I
cannot consent that I should say aught with boldness, for it is because of Thy
love that I am bold.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the king heard these things from
the bridegroom and from the bride, he rent his garments, and said to those who
were by him: &quot;Go forth in haste through the whole city, and go about,
(and) bring me that sorcerer, whom I introduced with my own hands into my
house, and bade him pray over my unlucky daughter. To the man who shall find
him and bring him to me, I will give whatever he shall ask.&quot; And they went
(and) were going about looking for him, and did not find him, because he had
set out. And they went to the inn where he had stayed, and found the flute-girl
sitting and weeping, because he had not taken her with him. And when they told
her what had happened, she was glad and saith: &quot;I have found rest
here.&quot; And she arose (and) went to the young people, and was dwelling with
them a long time. And they taught the king too, and collected a number of
brethren, until news was heard of the Apostle (being) in the realm of India;
and they went to him and were united unto him.</p>

<p align=center>Here ends the first act.</p>

<p align=center>The second act, when Thomas the
Apostle entered into India, and built a palace for the king in Heaven.</p>

<p>AND when Judas had entered into the realm
of India with the merchant Habb&#257;n, Habb&#257;n went to salute
G&#363;dnaphar, the king of India, and he told him of the artificer whom he
had brought for him. And the king was very glad, and ordered Judas to come into
his presence. And the king said to him: &quot;What art dost thou know to
practise?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;I am a carpenter, the servant of a
carpenter and architect.&quot; He saith to him: &quot;What dost thou know to
make?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;In wood I know (how) to make yokes and
ploughs and ox-goads, and oars for barges and ferryboats, and masts for ships;
and in hewn stone, tombstones and monuments and palaces for kings.&quot; The
king saith to Judas: &quot;And I want such an artificer.&quot; The king saith
to him: &quot;Wilt thou build me a palace?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;I
will build it and finish it, for I am come to work at building and
carpentering.&quot;</p>

<p>And he took him and went outside the gate
of the city, and was talking with him about the constructing of the palace, and
about its foundations, how they should be laid. And when he had reached the
place where the king wished him to build a palace for him, he said  to Judas:
&quot;Here I wish you to build for me a palace.&quot; Judas saith to him:
&quot;(Yes,) for this is a place which is suitable for it.&quot; Now it was of
this sort; it was a meadow, and there was plenty of water near it. The king
saith to him: &quot;Begin to build here.&quot; Judas saith to him:
&quot;Now I cannot build, at this time.&quot; The king saith to him: &quot;And
at what time wilt thou be able to build?&quot; Judas saith: &quot;I will begin
in Teshri (Oct.-Nov.), and I will finish in Nisan (April).&quot; The king saith
to him: &quot;All buildings are built in summer; and thou buildest in
winter!&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;Thus (only) is it possible for the
palace to be built.&quot; The king saith to him: &quot;Well then, trace it out
for me that I may see it, because after a long time I shall come hither.&quot;
And Judas came and took a cane, and began to measure; and he left doors towards
the east for light, and windows towards the west for air; and (he made) the
bake-house to the south, and the water-pipes for the service (of the house) to
the north. The king saith to him: &quot;Verily thou art a good artificer, and
art worthy to serve a king;&quot; and he left with him a large sum of money,
and departed from him.     </p>

<p>And he was sending silver and gold to him
from time to time. But Judas was going about in the villages and cities, and
was ministering to the poor, and was making the afflicted comfortable, and was
saying: &quot;What is the king's shall be given to the king, and many shall
have rest.&quot; </p>

<p>And after a long time, the king despatched
messengers to Judas, and sent (a message) to him thus: &quot;Send me (word)
what thou hast done, and what I shall send thee.&quot; And Judas sent him
(word): &quot;The palace is built, but the roof is wanting to it.&quot; Then
the king sent to Judas silver and gold, and sent him (word): &quot;Let the
palace be roofed.&quot; And the Apostle was glorifying our Lord and saying:
&quot;I thank Thee, Lord, who didst die that Thou mightest give me life; and
who didst sell me that I might be the liberator of many.&quot; And he did not
cease to teach, and to relieve those who were afflicted, saying: &quot;May your
Lord give you rest, to whom alone is the glory; for He is the nourisher of the
orphans and the provider of the widows, and He ministers unto all those who are
afflicted.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the king came to the city, he was
asking every one of his friends about the palace which Judas had built for him
; but they say unto him: &quot;There is  no palace built, nor has he done
anything else, but he was going about the cities and villages, and giving to
the poor, and teaching them the new God, and also healing the sick, and driving
out demons, and doing many things; and we think that he is a sorcerer; but his
compassion, and his healing, which was done without recompense, and his
asceticism, and his piety, make (us) think of him either that he is a magus, or
an Apostle of the new God; for he fasts much and prays much, and eats bread and
salt and drinks water, and wears one garment, and takes nothing from any man
for himself, and whatever he has he gives to others.&quot; And when the king
heard these things, he smote his face with his hands, and was shaking his head.</p>

<p>And he sent (and) called Judas and the
merchant who had brought him, and said to him: &quot;Hast thou built me the
palace?'' Judas saith to him: &quot;I have built thee the palace.&quot; The
king saith to him: &quot;In what time can we go (and) look at it?&quot; Judas
saith to him: &quot;Thou canst not see it now, but when thou hast departed from
this world.&quot; Then the king became very furious in his anger, and commanded
that Thomas and the merchant who had brought him, being bound, should go to
prison, till he could question him about what had done — to whom he had given
it — and then destroy him. But Judas went rejoicing, and said to the merchant:
&quot;Fear not, but only believe, and thou shalt be freed from this world, and
shalt receive everlasting life in the world to come.&quot;</p>

<p>And the king was considering by what death
he should kill Judas and the merchant; and he took the resolution that he would
burn him, after being flayed, with the merchant his companion. And in that very
night, the brother of the king, whose name was Gad, was taken ill through grief
and through the imposition which had been practised upon the king.   And he
sent (and) called the king, and said to him: &quot;My brother, I commend unto
thee my house and my children, for I am grieved and am dying because of the
imposition that hath been practised upon thee. If thou dost not punish that
sorcerer, thou wilt not let my soul be at peace in Sheol.&quot; The king saith
to him: &quot;The whole night I have been considering, how I should kill him,
and I have resolved to burn him with fire after he hath been flayed.&quot; Then
the brother of the king said to him: &quot;And if there be anything else that
is worse than this, do (it) to him; and I give thee charge of my house and my
children.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had said these things, his
soul left him. And the king was grieved for his brother, because he loved him
much; and he wished to bury him in a splendid sepulchre. But when the soul of
Gad, the brother of the king, had left him, angels took it and bore it up to
heaven; and they were showing it each place in succession, (and asking it) in
which of them it wished to be. Then, when they came to the palace which Judas
had built for the king, his brother saw it, and said to the angels: &quot;I beg
of you, my lords, let me dwell in one of the lower chambers of this
palace.&quot; The angels say to him: &quot;Thou canst not dwell in this palace.&quot;
He saith to them: &quot;Wherefore?&quot; They say to him: &quot;This palace is
the one which the Christian hath built for thy brother.&quot; Then he said to
them: &quot;I beg of you, my lords, let me go, that I may go to my brother and
buy of him this palace; for my brother hath not seen it, and will sell it to
me.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the angels let go the soul of Gad.
And as they were enshrouding him, his soul came into him, and he said to those
who were standing before him: &quot;Call my brother to me that I may make of
him one request.&quot; Then they sent word to the king, &quot;Thy brother is
come to life.&quot; And the king sprang up from his place, and went into the
house of his brother with a number of people. And when he had gone in beside
his bed, he was astounded and was unable to speak with him. His brother saith
to him: &quot; I know, my brother, that if a man had asked thee for the half of
thy kingdom, thou wouldst have <i>given </i>it for me. And now I beg of thee
that thou wouldst <i>sell </i>me that at which thou hast laboured.&quot; The
king saith to him: &quot;Tell me, what shall I sell thee?&quot; He saith to
him: &quot;Swear unto me.&quot; And he swore unto him that he would grant him
whatever he asked of all that he had. He saith to him: &quot;Sell me the palace
which thou hast in heaven.&quot; The king saith to him: &quot;Who hath given <i>me
</i>a palace in heaven?&quot; His brother saith to him: &quot;(It is) that
which the Christian hath built for thee.&quot; The king saith to him:
&quot;That I cannot sell to thee; but I pray and beg of God that I may enter
into it and receive it, and may be worthy to be among its inhabitants. And
thou, if thou really wishest to buy thyself a palace, this architect will build
(one) for thee which will be better than that of mine.&quot; And he sent (and)
brought out Judas and the merchant who was imprisoned with him, and said to
him: &quot;I beg of thee, as a man who begs of a minister of God, that thou
wouldst pray for me, and beg for me from the God whom thou worshippest, that He
would forgive me what I have done unto thee; and that He would make me worthy
to enter into the palace which thou hast built for me; and that I may become a
worshipper of this God whom thou preachest.&quot; And his brother came and fell
down before the feet of the Apostle, and said to him: &quot;I beg of thee—I too
supplicate before thy God, that I may become worthy to Be a worshipper of His,
and may also receive what He hath shown me by the hand of the angels.&quot;</p>

<p>Judas saith: &quot;I praise Thee, our Lord
Jesus the Messiah, who art alone the God of truth, and there is no other, and
Thou knowest whatever man does not know. Thou, whose mercy is upon men, whom
Thou hast willed and made,—and they have forgotten Thee, but Thou hast not
neglected them—do Thou receive the king and his brother, and unite them to Thy
fold, and anoint them, and purify them from their uncleanness, and guard them
from wolves, and feed them in Thy meadows, and let them drink of Thy fountain,
which is never turbid and the stream whereof never faileth; for, lo, they beg
of Thee and supplicate, and wish to become servants of Thine, and to be
persecuted by Thy enemy and to be hated for Thy sake. Let them therefore have
boldness in Thee, and be confirmed by Thy glorious mysteries, and receive of
the gifts of Thy gifts.&quot;</p>

<p>And they were rejoicing with holy hymns,
and were cleaving unto the Apostle and not parting from him; and every one who
was needy, was receiving and being relieved. And they begged of him that they
might receive the sign (of baptism, saying:) &quot;For we have heard that all
the sheep of that God, whom thou preachest, are known to Him by the sign.&quot;
Judas saith to them: &quot; I too rejoice, and I ask of you to partake of the
Eucharist and of the blessing of this Messiah whom I preach.&quot; And the
king gave orders that the bath should be closed for seven days, and that no man
should bathe in it. And when the seven days were done, on the eighth day they
three entered into the bath by night that Judas might baptise them. And many
lamps were lighted in the bath.</p>

<p>And when they had entered into the
bath-house, Judas went in before them. And our Lord appeared unto them, and
said to them: &quot;Peace be with you, my brethren.&quot; And they heard the
voice only, but the form they did not see, whose it was, for till now they had
not been baptised. And Judas went up and stood upon the edge of the cistern,
and poured oil upon their heads, and said: &quot;Come, holy name of the
Messiah; come, power of grace, which art from on high; come, perfect mercy;
come, exalted gift; come, sharer of the blessing; come, revealer of hidden
mysteries; come, mother of seven houses, whose rest was in the eighth house;
come, messenger of reconciliation, and communicate with the minds of these
youths; come, Spirit of holiness, and purify their reins and their
hearts.&quot; And he baptised them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Spirit of holiness. And when they had come up out of the water, a youth
appeared to them, and he was holding a lighted taper; and the light of the
lamps became pale through its light. And when they had gone forth, he became
invisible to them; and the Apostle said: &quot;We were not even able to bear
Thy light, because it is too great for our vision.&quot; And when it dawned and
was morning, he broke the Eucharist and let them partake of the table of the
Messiah ; and they were glad and rejoicing.</p>

<p>And when many were added and were coming
to the refuge of the Messiah, Judas did not cease to preach and to say to them:
&quot;Men and women and children, youths and maidens, shun fornication and
covetousness and the service of demons; for under these three heads comes all
wickedness. For fornication blinds the intellect, and darkens the eyes of the
soul; it confuses the steps of the body, and changes its complexion, and makes
it sick. And covetousness puts the soul into agitation in the midst of the
body, so that it takes what does not belong to it, and is afraid lest, when it
returns the thing to its owners, it should be put to shame. And the service of
the belly makes the soul dwell in care and sorrow, fearing lest it should come
to want, and grasp at things that are far from it. For since ye have been
delivered from thence, ye are become without care and without grief; and there
remains with you (the saying): 'Take no care for the morrow, because the morrow
will take care of itself.' And bear in mind the other (saying), which is
written for you: 'Look upon the ravens, and consider the fowl of heaven, which
sow not nor reap, and God feedeth them; how much more then will He have care
for you, ye lacking in faith?' But expect the coming of Jesus, and hope in Him,
and believe in His name, because He is the Judge of the dead and of the quick,
and He shall recompense every man according to his works at His last coming.
For it will be no excuse for one to say; 'We did not know.' His heralds are
proclaiming
in the four quarters of the world: 'Repent and believe in the new preaching,
and receive the pleasant yoke and the light burden, and live and die not. Gain
(these), and perish not. Come forth from the darkness, and the light will
receive you. Come to the Good, and receive for yourselves grace, and plant the
Cross in your souls.' &quot;</p>

<p>And when the Apostle had said these
things, some of them said to him: &quot;It is time for the debtor to be
paid.&quot; He saith to them: &quot;The creditor always seeketh more, but let
us give him as much as is proper.&quot; And he spake a blessing over the bread
and the olives, and gave unto them. And he himself ate, because the Sunday was,
dawning. And when the Apostle was asleep in the night, our Lord came and stood
over him and said to him: &quot;Thomas, rise, go forth in the morning after the
service, and go along the eastern road about two miles, and I will show in thee
my glory; for because of this on account of which thou goest out, many shall
come to my refuge and shall live, and thou shalt reprove the power and the
nature of the enemy.&quot; And when he awoke from his sleep, he said to the
brethren who were. beside him: &quot;My children, our Lord will do today
whatsoever He will; but let us pray and beg of Him that there be to us  no
hindrance  towards  Him,  but, just as at all times when He wisheth to show His
power in us, (so) now too let His will be accomplished.&quot; And when he had
spoken thus, he laid his hand upon them, and broke  the Eucharist,  and gave
unto all of them, and said to them: &quot;Let this Eucharist be unto you for
grace and mercy, and not for judgement and vengeance.&quot; And they said,
&quot;Amen.&quot; </p>

<p align=center>Here ends the second Act.</p>

<p align=center>The third act of Judas,
regarding the black snake.</p>

<p>AND the Apostle went forth to go whither
our Lord had told him. And when he reached (the distance of) two miles, he
turned aside from the road a little, and saw lying there a corpse of a handsome
youth, and said: &quot;Was it for this trial Thou didst bring me out hither,
our Lord? Let it be as Thou wilt.&quot; And he began praying and saying:
&quot;Our Lord, Lord of the dead and of the quick—of the quick, who, lo; are
standing, and of the dead, who, lo, are lying, — O Lord, Lord of the souls
which abide in the body, and Father of all the souls which have gone out of the
body, — come, Lord, at this moment, for the sake of the dust which Thy holy
hands have fashioned, and look down from, heaven, for I call upon Thee, and
show Thy glory in this (man) who is lying here.&quot; And he said again:
&quot;This deed has not taken place without the instigation of the enemy, who
does these things; but the enemy, who does these things, has not dared (to
attempt it) through one who is alien to him, but (through one) who is subject
to his will.&quot; And when he had said these things, a black snake came forth
from a fissure, and was shaking his head violently, and beating his tail on the
ground. And with a loud voice he said to the Apostle: &quot;I will say before
thee on what account I slew this youth.  There  was  a woman fair of face in
this village which is over-against thee; and as she passed by me, I saw her and
loved her; and I went after her, and saw this youth kissing her, and he also
slept with her, and did other things with her which are unseemly, — easy for me
(to say), but to thee I do not dare to utter them, because I know that the
ocean-flood of the Messiah will destroy our nature. And in order that I might
not alarm her, I did not kill him at that time, but I watched him, and in the
evening, when he passed by me, I struck him and killed him, and especially
because he had dared to do this thing on the Sunday.&quot; Judas saith to him:
&quot;Of what seed art thou?&quot; </p>

<p>The snake saith to him: &quot;I am
reptile, the son of reptile) and harmer, the son of harmer; I am the son of
him, to whom power was given over all creatures, and he troubled them. I am the
son of him, who makes himself like unto God to those who obey him, that they
may do his will. I am the son of him, who is ruler over everything that is
created under heaven. I am the son of him, who is outside of the ocean, and
whose mouth is closed. I am the kinsman of him, who spake with Eve, and through
her made Adam transgress the commandment of God. And I am he who incited Cain
to slay his brother. And on my account, — because for this I was created, — the
earth was cursed and thorns grew up in it. I am he who dared, and cast down the
just from their height, and corrupted them through the lust of women; and they
begat sons large of body, and I worked in them my will. And I am he who
hardened the heart of Pharaoh, that he might slay the children of Israel, and
keep them down in hard slavery. I am he who led the people astray in the
desert, when I subdued them so that they made for themselves the calf. I am he
who stirred up Caiaphas and Herod by slander against the Righteous Judge. I am
he who caused Judas to take the bribe, when he was made subject to me, that he
might deliver up the Messiah to death. I am he to whom the power of this world
was given, and the Son of Mary has seized me by force and taken what was His
from me. I am the kinsman of him, who is to come from the east, to whom the
power is given.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had finished, the multitude
was hearing all these things; and fear with belief settled on all those who
were there, when they saw and heard these wonders. And they were crying out
alike with one voice: &quot;One is the God of this man, who has informed us
concerning his God, and by his word has commanded this fearful beast, and it
has disclosed its nature.&quot; And they were begging of him that, as he had
commanded it by his word to speak like a man, so too by his word he would kill
it.</p>

<p>Then Judas made a sign to them with his
hand, and raised his voice and said: &quot;Thou art audacious, though thy
nature is laid bare, and thou shalt be slain. And thy insolence, which has gone
so far, ought not to have been (such) that thou shouldst tell those things
which were done by those who were subject to thee; and thou hast not feared
that thy end was come. But to thee I say, in the name of our Lord Jesus, who
struggled against thy nature even to the end for His human beings, that thou
suck out the poison which thou hast cast into this youth; because my God has
sent me to</p>

<p>ill thee and to raise him up alive before
this multitude, that they may believe in Him, that He is the true God and that
there is no other.&quot; And the snake said to him: &quot;Our destruction is
not as yet come, as thou hast said. &quot;Why compellest thou me to take (back)
what I have put into this youth? For were even my father to suck out and take
(back) what he has cast into the creation, it would be his destruction.&quot;
The Apostle saith to him: &quot;Show, then, the nature of thy father.&quot; And
the snake came, and put his mouth upon the wound of the youth, and was sucking the
poison from it; and by little and little, as the poison was drawn out, the
colour of the youth, which had become like purple, became white, and the snake
was swelling. And when he had drawn out the whole of the poison from the youth,
he sprang upright, and ran to the feet of the Apostle, and fell down and
worshipped him. Then the snake burst, according to the word of Judas; and a
great pit was made in the place where the poison of the snake fell. And Judas
commanded the king and his brother to fill up that place, and lay foundations,
and make in it houses (as) places of entertainment for strangers.</p>

<p>And the youth was glorifying God, through
whose grace he had come to life by the hand of the Apostle Judas, and had been
rescued from all his former deeds. And he begged of the Apostle that he would
aid him in prayer to our Lord, being upbraided by his own conscience, and was
saying: &quot;To Thee be glory, merciful and great and glorious God, maker and
founder of all created things. Thou hast set a limit and a measure to all Thy
creatures whom Thou hast created; and hast appointed for them changes that are
beneficial to  their natures. Thou art He who didst make man, as Thy Godhead
willed, with the fashioning of Thy hands, that he might be ruler above; and
didst create for him another creation, that he might strive against it with
the  free-will which Thou didst give him. But the free nature of man went
astray, and he became subject to his fellow; and that (fellow) became an enemy
to him, because he found that he had been unmindful of his free-will. And the
enemy rejoiced that he had found an entrance into his fellow, and thought that
he would be master over all the slaves; but Thou, O Merciful, through Thy great
mercy, didst spread over us Thy goodness, and didst send to our human race Thy
Word, the Disposer of all created things, through Thy glorious Son. And He,
through His free-will, which Thou gavest Him,—Thy goodness  aiding  Him,—came
and  found us  in  those works which our human nature did from the first day.
And Thou didst not enter into a reckoning with us for our sins, but didst bring
me to life through Thy goodness, and didst show me my remissness, and didst sow
in me Thy heavenly love; and didst open my mouth, which was shut, that I might
speak of my enslaver and of Thy abundant grace, which is not angry with me for
what I say concerning it, about whose great love I am speaking.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas stretched out his hand to him,
and raised him up, and embraced him, and  said  to him: &quot;The grace of our
Lord be with thee and with all those who believe in Him.&quot;    And the youth
said: &quot;Glory to Thee, O God,—who did not withhold His mercy from me, who
was lost, but showed me (how) to seek my own soul, and informed me concerning
thee, that thou art His Apostle, and said to thee: 'I have many things to show
through thee, and thou hast many works to accomplish through Me, for which thou
shalt receive their reward ; and thou shalt give life to many, and they shall
become on high, in the light, sons of God. Do thou, therefore, bring to life
this youth, who has been smitten by his  enemy, because thou at all times
beholdest thy Lord.'  Yea, my lord, Apostle of God, thou hast done well to come
hither, and thou hast drawn many unto Him, and He will not fail thee. And I am
without care and without suffering, because of His grace which has come upon
me through thee, and (because) His gift has been poured out abundantly upon my
weakness. And I have been freed from evil cares and from deeds of corruption,
and have been delivered from him, who was alluring me and inciting me to do
those things in which thou didst find me,  and have understood Him who was
saying to me' the opposite of them.    And I have destroyed him, who, through
darkness, his kinsman, made me stumble by his works; and I have found the
Light, the Lord of the day, who had not been seen by me, and I have seen him.
And  I  have destroyed him, who  was  darkening and obscuring all those who
cleave unto him and obey him, so that they cannot see what they are doing and
be ashamed of their deeds and desist from them, and his work (thereby) come to
an end; and I have found Him, whose doing this is, that those who do His will
should never repent. I have been delivered from him, whom fraud supports, and
before whom goes a veil (of darkness), and after whom comes shame, and she
daring in impudence. And I have found Him, who clears away evils, the Lord of
peace and the Confirmer of truth, who makes the<br>
enemy pass away from those who turn repenting unto Him, and heals their
afflictions, and destroys their disturber. But I beg of thee, Apostle of God,
sow in me thy word of life, so that I may again hear perfectly the voice of
Him, who delivered me unto thee and said to thee, 'This is (one) of those who
shall live through thee, and henceforth let him be with thee.' &quot;</p>

<p>Judas saith to him: &quot;If thou wilt be
delivered from these things which thou hast learned, as thou hast said, from
the doer of evils, and wilt listen to Him, whom in the fervour of thy love thou
now seekest, thou shalt see Him, and shalt be with Him for ever, and shalt rest
with Him by His grace, and shalt be with Him in His joy. But if thou art
negligent of Him, and comest to those former deeds of thine, and insultest Him,
whom, because of (His) beauty and because of the aspect of His light, thou now
eagerly desirest, thou shalt not only be deprived of that life which thou hast
seen, but thou shalt also lose this in which thou art abiding.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas came to the city, and took the
hand of the youth, and said to him: &quot;My son, these things which thou hast
seen are a few out of the many that belong to our God; for He doth not send us
tidings concerning these things that are seen, but promiseth us better things;
for as long as we are in the world, we are unable to speak about that which all
the believers in God are going to receive. For if we say that He hath given us
light, we mention something which we have seen; and if we say that He hath
given us wealth, we mention something that is in the world ; and if we speak of
(fine) clothing, we mention something that nobles wear; and if we speak of
daintymeats, we mention something against which we are warned; and if
we speak of (this) temporary rest, a chastisement is appointed for it. But we
speak of God and of our Lord Jesus, and of the Angels and the guardian spirits
and the saints, and of the new world, and of the incorruptible food of the tree
of life, and of the draught (of the water) of life; of what eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man (to conceive), — what
God hath prepared from of old for those who love Him. Of this we speak, and of
this we preach. Believe in Him, therefore, my son, that thou mayest live, and
trust in Him, that thou mayest not die; for He will not take a bribe, that thou
shouldst offer (it) to Him, nor is He pleased with a sacrifice, that thou
shouldest sacrifice it (to Him). Look unto Him, and He will not neglect thee,
and turn unto Him, and He will not forsake thee; for His beauty will incite
thee to love Him, and He will not suffer thee to turn away from Him.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Judas had said these things to
the youth, great multitudes joined (them). And the Apostle lifted up his eyes,
and saw people raised up upon one another that they might see him, and going up
to lofty places. And the Apostle saith to them: &quot;Ye men, who are come to
the assembly of the Messiah, men who wish to believe in Jesus, take unto
yourselves an example from this, that, if ye do not raise yourselves up, ye
cannot see me who am little. Me, who am like yourselves, ye are unable to see;
Him, who is on high and is found in the depths, how shall ye be able to see,
unless ye raise yourselves above your former works, and above the deeds that
profit not, and the pleasures that abide not, and the corruptible wealth that
remaineth here; and above riches and possessions that perish on the earth, and
above garments that decay, and above beauty that becomes old and is disfigured,
and above the body, in which all these are included, and which becomes dust,
and which all these support? But believe, and trust in our Lord Jesus the
Messiah, Him whom we preach, in order that your hope may be in Him, and that in
Him ye may live for ever and ever, and that He may be to I you a guide in the
land of error, and may be to you a haven in the sea of trouble, and may be to
you a fountain of living water in the region of thirst, and may be to you a
full basket in the place of hunger, and maybe a rest to your souls and a healer
and giver of life  to your bodies.&quot; </p>

<p>Then the multitudes were crying out:
&quot;Apostle of the living God, and guide in the path of life, and revealer of
the mysteries of the truth, many are the things that have been done for us, who
are aliens from the glorious God whom thou preachest, and until now we do not dare
to say that we are His, because our works are alien from Him and hateful before
Him.    But if He will have compassion upon us, and deliver us from our former
deeds, and from the evil things that were done by us in error, and will not
enter into reckoning with us nor remember against us our former sins, we will
become servants of His and accomplish His will.&quot; Judas saith to them:
&quot;He will not reckon against you your sins which ye did in error, but He
will pardon you your iniquities, those former ones which ye did without
knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p align=center>Here ends the third Act.</p>

<p align=center>The fourth Act, of the Ass that spake. </p>

<p>AND whilst the Apostle was standing in his
place on the road, and speaking with those multitudes concerning the kingdom of
God, and concerning their conversion and repentance unto our Lord,—whilst the
Apostle was standing on the road, and speaking with those multitudes, an ass's
colt came and stood before him. And Judas said: &quot;It is not without the
direction of God that this colt has come hither. But to thee I say, O colt,
that, by the grace of our Lord, there shall be given to thee speech before
these multitudes who are standing here; and do thou say whatsoever thou wilt,
that they may believe in the God of truth, whom we preach.&quot;</p>

<p>And the mouth of the colt was opened, and
it spake like a man by the power of our Lord, and said to him: &quot;Twin of
the Messiah, and Apostle of the Most High, and sharer in the hidden word of the
Life-giver, and receiver of the secret mysteries of the Son of God; freeborn,
who didst become a slave, to bring many to freedom by thy obedience; son of a
great family, who became bereaved, that by the power of thy Lord thou mightest
deprive the enemy of many, so that thou mightest become the cause of life to
the country of the Indians; (thou) who didst come against thy will to men who
were straying from God, and, lo, by the sight of thee and by thy godly words
they are turned unto life; mount (and) ride upon me, and rest until thou
enterest the city.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas lifted up his voice and said:
&quot;O Jesus, Son of perfect mercy; O Thou quiet and silent (One), who
speakest by animals that have not speech; O hidden (One), that art seen in Thy
works; our Nourisher and Guardian; the Giver of life to our bodies and the
Giver of life to our souls; sweet spring that never faileth, and clear fountain
that is never polluted; Thou who art a help to Thy servants in the contest, and
crushest the enemy before them; Thou who standest up in contests for us, and
makest us victorious in them all; our true Athlete, who cannot be hurt, and our
holy General, who cannot be conquered; Thou who givest to Thine own joy that
passeth not away, and rest in which there is no more affliction; Thou good
Shepherd, that giveth his life for his flock, who hath overcome the wolf and
rescued his lambs; we glorify Thee, and we exalt through Thee Thy exalted
Father, who is not seen, and the holy Spirit that broodeth over all created
things.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the Apostle had said these
things, all the multitudes that were assembled there were looking to see what
answer he was about to give to the colt. And after the Apostle had stood a long
time wondering and looking up to heaven, he said to the colt: &quot;Who art
thou? And what is thine errand, that by thy mouth wonders are uttered and great
things that are more than many?&quot; The colt saith to him: &quot;I am of that
stock that served Balaam the prophet, and God thy Lord rode upon my kin; and I
am sent unto thee to give thee rest, and that thereby the faith of these might
be confirmed, and that that other portion might be added to me, which I have
got today in order to serve thee and which will be taken away from me when I
have served thee.&quot; Thomas saith to him: &quot;God, who has given thee this
gift now, is to be relied on to give it hereafter too in full to thee and thy
kindred; for I am too little and weak for this mystery.&quot; And he would not
ride upon it.</p>

<p>And the colt was begging of him and
supplicating him that it might be blessed by his riding (upon it). And he
mounted and rode upon it. And the people were going after and before the
Apostle, and were running to see what would happen to him, and how he would let
the colt go. And when he reached the gate of the city, he dismounted from it,
and said to it: &quot;Go, be preserved as thou hast been.&quot; And at that moment
the colt fell down and died. And all who were there were sorry for it, and were
saying to the Apostle: &quot;Bring it to life again.&quot; The Apostle says to
them: &quot;It is not because I am Unable to bring this colt to life, that I do
not bring it to life, for He who gave it speech was able to make it not die;
but this is a benefit to it.&quot; And the Apostle commanded those who were
with him to dig  a place and bury its body; and they did as he commanded them.</p>

<p align=center>Here ends the fourth Act.</p>

<p align=center>The fifth Act, of the Demon
that dwelt in the Woman.</p>

<p>AND the Apostle went into the city, the
multitudes accompanying him; and he was thinking of going to the house of the
family of the youth whom he had brought to life, because he had begged this
earnestly of him.</p>

<p>And a fair woman cried with a loud voice
and said to him: &quot;Apostle of the new God, who art come to India; servant
of the holy God, who by thee is proclaimed both the Giver of life to the souls
of those that come unto Him, and the Healer of the bodies of those who are
tortured by the enemy; (thou) who art the cause of life to the whole people of
India;  permit them to bring  me before  thee, that I may tell  thee what has
befallen me, so that perchance I may get hope from thee, and these who are standing
by may be greatly strengthened in the  God who is proclaimed by thee. And I
tell thee, that I am not slightly tormented by the enemy, lo, for the space of
five years. For I was sitting in ease, and peace was around me on all sides,
and I had no concern about anything, because I knew no care.    And it happened
one day, as I was coming out of the bath, a man met me, who seemed troubled in
his aspect, (and) his voice and  speech were very weak. And he said to me:
&quot;I and thou shall be in one love, and do thou have intercourse with me as
a man and a woman have intercourse.&quot; And I said to him: &quot;I did not
yield myself to my betrothed, because I cannot bear a man; and to thee, who
wishest to have adulterous intercourse with me, how can I give myself to thee?&quot;
And I said to the maiden who was with me: &quot;See the impudence of this young
man, (who goes) so far as to talk licentiously to me.&quot; And she said to me:
&quot;I saw an <i>old </i>man who was talking to thee.&quot; And when I had
gone home and supped, my heart made me afraid of him, because he had appeared
to me in two forms; and I went to sleep thinking of him. And he came in the
night and had filthy intercourse with me, and by day too I saw him and fled
from him; but by night he used to come in a terrible form, and torture me. And
lo, up to the present, as thou seest me, lo, for five years he has not left me
alone. But because I know and believe that both devils and spirits and demons
are subject to thee and dread thy prayer, I beg of thee, my lord, that thou
wouldst pray over me, and ask of God, and drive away from me this affliction,
and (that), for the time that is appointed to me, I may be free, and may be
united  to my former nature, and receive the gift that is given to the
penitent. </p>

<p>Then the Apostle, when he saw the instigation
of the enemy, lifted up his voice and said: &quot;O evil that cannot be
repressed! O enemy who art never at rest! O envious one who art never quiet! O
hideous (one) who strivest with the comely, that thou mayest subdue them under
thee! O (thou) who hast many hideous shapes, and appearest as thou wilt, but
thy black colour never changes, because it is thy nature! O crafty (one) and
disturber of good works! O bitter tree, the fruits of which are like unto it! O
lying slanderer, who strivest with those that are not thine! O deceit which,
coiled up upon itself, rears itself with impudence and dares to assail those
who are better than itself! O wickedness, that creepeth like a serpent, and
crawleth, and entereth in, and aimeth at virtue! But how long do I say these
things  (Keep me not waiting,) but show thyself quickly, thou enemy of the
servants of the Messiah, that these multitudes may see that we call them unto
the true God.&quot; And when the Apostle had said these things, the enemy came
and stood before him, no one seeing him except the Apostle and the woman, and
cried with a loud voice, whilst all those who were there heard him: &quot;What
have we to do with thee, Apostle of the Most High? What have we to do with
thee, servant of Jesus the Messiah? What have we to do with thee, thou sharer
in the holy mysteries of God? Why dost thou wish to destroy us, when our time
is not yet come? Why dost thou wish to take away the power that was given us,
when till now we have had reliance upon it? What have we to do with thee, that
thou art come to drive us out? Thou hast power over them that obey thee, and we
have power over them that are subject unto us. Why dost thou wish to use
violence
towards us before our time, when thou enjoinest others not to use violence
towards any man? Why dost thou covet what is not thine?  For thine own suffice
thee not. Why art thou like unto God thy Lord, who concealed His majesty and
appeared in the flesh, and we thought regarding Him that He was mortal, but He
turned and did us violence? For thou; namely, art born of Him. For when we
thought that we could bring Him under our power, He turned and hurled us down
into the abyss; for we did not know Him, because He deceived us by His humble
aspect, and by His need and His poverty; and we thought, when we saw Him, that
He was one of  the children of men, and we did not know that He was the Giver
of life to all mankind.   But He gave us power not to slacken our hold of our
own, so long as our time lasts, and we occupy ourselves with our own. But thou,
lo, wishest to acquire more than He has given unto thee and to afflict
us.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the demon had said these things,
he wept again and said: &quot;I quit thee, O my fair wife, whom I found a long
time ago and was at rest on thee. I quit thee, my sister and my beloved, on
whom I hoped to abide. What I shall do, I know not, nor on whom I shall call
for help, that he may aid me. I know what I shall do. I shall go to another
country, where I shall not hear tell of this man; for thee, my beloved, I shall
find a substitute.&quot; And he lifted up his voice and said: &quot; Fare thou <i>not
</i>well, who hast taken refuge with one who is greater than I. I go to wander
and seek for myself one like thee; and if I find not (one) for me, I will again
return unto thee; for I know that now, because this man is near unto thee, lo,
thou takest refuge with him. I then depart hence, and thou becomest as thou
wast; but when night cometh, and thou forgettest him, I shall have an
opportunity (of getting) at thee, for now the name of Him whom this (man)
proclaims hath frightened me.&quot; And when the demon had said these  things,
at that moment he  was looked for and was not found <i>(i. e., </i>disappeared
suddenly), but smoke and fire were seen after him; and all those who were
standing there were amazed.</p>

<p>And when the Apostle saw (this), he said
to them: &quot;The accursed one has shown nothing strange, but the nature by
which he has been consumed; for the fire consumes him, and the smoke ascends
from him.&quot; And the Apostle began to say: &quot;Jesus, hidden mystery that
hath been revealed to me, Thou hast revealed Thy mysteries unto me more than
to all my fellows, and hast spoken unto me words with which, lo, I am burning,
but which I am not able to utter. Jesus, born a man, slain, dead ; Jesus, God,
Son of God, Life-giver and Restorer of the dead to life; Jesus, poor, and
catching fish for dinner and supper; Jesus, satisfying many thousands with a
little bread; Jesus, resting from the fatigue of a journey like a man, and
walking upon the waves of the sea like a God; Jesus, exalted Voice that arose
from perfect mercy, Saviour of all, and Liberator and Administrator of the
world, and Strengthener of the dead; Jesus, right hand of the Father, who hast
hurled down the evil one to the lowest limit, and collected his possessions
into one blessed place of meeting; Jesus, King , over all and subduing all;
Jesus, who art in the Father and the Father in Thee, and Ye are one in power
and in will and in glory and in essence, and for our sake Thou wast named with
names, and art the Son, and didst put on the body; Jesus, who didst become a
Naz&#299;r, and Thy grace provides for all like God; Son of God Most High, who
didst become a man despised and humble; Jesus, who dost not neglect us in
anything which we ask of Thee, who art the cause of life to all mankind; Jesus,
who wast called a deceiver on our account, Thou who rescuest from deceit Thy
human beings; I entreat of Thee on behalf of these who are standing (here) and
believing in Thee, and in need of Thy help, and expecting Thy gift, and taking
refuge with Thy majesty, and opening their ears to hear Thy words which are
spoken by us,—let Thy grace come, and Thy faith abide upon them and make them
new from their former deeds, and may they put off their old man with his deeds
and put on the new man which is proclaimed unto them by me.&quot;</p>

<p>And he laid his hand upon them, and
blessed them, and said to them: &quot;May the grace of our Lord be upon you for
ever and ever, Amen.&quot; And the woman begged of him and saith to him:
&quot;Apostle of the Most High, give me the seal of my Lord, that the enemy may
not again come back upon me.&quot; And he went to a river which was close by
there, and baptized her in the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit of
holiness; and many were baptized with her. And the Apostle ordered his deacon
to make ready the Eucharist; and he brought a bench thither, and spread over it
a linen cloth; and he brought (and) placed upon it the bread of blessing. And
the Apostle came (and) stood beside it, and said: &quot;Jesus, who hast deemed
us worthy to draw nigh unto Thy holy Body and to partake of Thy life-giving
Blood; and because of our reliance upon Thee we are bold and draw nigh, and
invoke Thy holy Name, which has been proclaimed by the Prophets as Thy Godhead
willed; and Thou art preached by Thy Apostles through the whole world according
to Thy grace, and art revealed by Thy mercy to the just; we beg of Thee that
Thou wouldest come and communicate with us for help and for life, and for the
conversion of Thy servants unto Thee, that they may go under Thy pleasant yoke
and under Thy victorious power, and that it may be unto them for the health of
their souls and for the life of their bodies in Thy living world.&quot; And he
began to say: &quot;Come, gift of the Exalted; come, perfect mercy; come, holy 
Spirit; come, revealer of the mysteries of the Chosen among the Prophets; come,
proclaimer by His Apostles of the combats of our victorious Athlete; come,
treasure of majesty; come, beloved of the mercy of the Most High; come, (thou)
silent (one), revealer of the mysteries of the Exalted;  come, utterer of
hidden things, and shewer of the works of our God; come, giver of life in
secret, and manifest in thy deeds; come, giver of joy and rest to all who
cleave unto thee; come, power of the Father and wisdom of the Son, for Ye are
one in all; come and communicate with us in this Eucharist which we celebrate,
and in this offering which we offer, and in this commemoration which we
make.&quot; And he made the sign of the Cross upon the bread, and began to give
(it). And he gave first to the woman, and said to her: &quot;Let it be unto
thee for the remission of transgressions and sins and for the everlasting
resurrection.&quot; And after her he gave to the persons who were baptized with
her. Then  he gave to every one, and said to them: &quot;Let this Eucharist be
unto you for life and rest, and not for judgement and vengeance;&quot; and they
said, &quot;Amen.&quot;</p>

<p align=center>Here ends the fifth Act.</p>

<p align=center>The sixth Act, of the Young Man
who killed the Girl. </p>

<p>AND there was there a young man, who had
committed a very hateful deed;  and he came and took the Eucharist, and was
going to put it into his mouth, but both his hands dried up and did not come to
his mouth. And when those who were with him saw him, they came (and) made known
to the Apostle what had befallen him. And the Apostle called him, and said to
him:  &quot;Tell me, my son, and be not ashamed before me. What hast thou done,
and art come hither now? For lo, the gift of our Lord hath convicted thee, this
(gift) which healeth the many who draw nigh unto it in love and in truth and in
faith, but hath utterly withered thee away. These things have not befallen thee
without cause.&quot; And when the youth saw that he was convicted by the
Eucharist of our Lord, he came (and) fell down before the feet of the Apostle,
and was begging of him, and interceding before him, and saying to him: &quot;An
evil deed have I done. I loved a woman (who lived) at an inn without the city,
and she too loved me; and because I heard from thee the truth which thou
speakest, and the faith of the God whom thou preachest, and knew in truth that
thou art the Apostle of God, I too received the sign with those who received
(it). And thou didst say thus: 'Whoever indulgeth in filthy intercourse,
especially in that of adultery, hath not life with this God whom I preach.' And
because I loved her, I begged of her and tried to persuade her to live with me
a life clean and pure and tranquil and chaste and modest, such as thou teachest, but she would not; and when I saw that she would not listen to me, I slept
with her and killed her, because I could not bear to see her while she was
having intercourse with other men.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the Apostle heard these (things),
he said: &quot;O corrupt love, that hath no shame, how it hath incited this man
to do these things! O the companion of corruption, how this man has not been
able to bear up against it! O lascivious intercourse, how it corrupts the minds
of men (and turns them away) from the purity of the Messiah! O the work of
deception, how it rears itself up exceedingly in its own!&quot; And the Apostle
ordered (them) to bring him water in a basin for washing; and they brought him
water that he might pray over it. And he glorified (God), and blessed (it), and
said: &quot;Water that was given unto us by the Living Water; Light that was
sent to us by the glorious Self-existent; Grace that was sent unto us by Grace;
let Thy victorious power come, and Thy healing and Thy mercy descend and abide
upon this water, over which I have proclaimed Thy name, Jesus our
Life-giver.&quot; And he said: &quot;May the gift of the Spirit of holiness be
perfected in you.&quot; And he said to the youth: &quot;Go, wash thy hands in
this water.&quot; And he went (and) washed his hands, and they became as they
had been before they were dried up. And the Apostle said to him: &quot;Dost
thou believe then in our Lord, that it is possible for Him to do
everything?&quot; The youth saith to him: &quot;I am not lacking in faith; yea,
because of this, that I believed in God, I did this deed, since I thought that
I did well; for I begged of her, as I have said before thee, and she was not
willing to listen to me (and) keep herself in purity and chastity; because of
that I did thus.&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;Come, let us go to the inn
where thou didst this deed.&quot; And he was going before the Apostle, and a
great multitude were coming after him. And when they arrived at the inn,, they
went into it, and found the woman dead. And when the Apostle saw her, he was
grieved for her, because she was a girl; and he said that they should take her
up and bring her out into the midst of the inn. And when they had brought her
and laid her on a couch, Judas Thomas laid his hand upon her, and began to say:
&quot;Jesus, our Life-giver, who never neglectest us at any time when we call
upon Thee; Jesus, who comest unto us at all times when we seek Thee; Thou whose
ear is inclined to this, that we should  seek Thee, and Thou givest unto us;
Jesus, who hast not only permitted us to ask, but hast also taught us how to
pray; Thou who now art not seen by us with  these bodily eyes of ours, but by
means of these eyes of our understanding dost not depart from us; Thou who art
hidden from us in Thy aspect, and revealed to us in Thy grace and the
administration of Thy works and Thy great deeds; Thou whom we know so far as we
are able, according to our measure, but who hast given us Thy gift beyond our
measure; Thou who hast said, 'Ask and it shall be given to you, seek and ye
shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you;' we ask therefore of Thee,
our Lord, fearing because of our trespasses and because of our sins, that Thou
wouldst spread over us grace by Thy mercy. Not gold, nor silver, nor riches,
nor possessions, nor goods, nor clothes, nor anything at all of these earthly
things that are of this world, and come from it and return to it, do we seek;
but we ask of Thee and beg of Thy benignity, that Thou wouldst raise up by Thy
holy name this (woman) who is lying before Thee, to Thy great glory, and to the
praise of Thy Godhead, and to the confirmation of Thy faith in these who are
standing by.&quot;</p>

<p>And he said to the youth: &quot; Stretch
thy mind towards our Lord;&quot; and he signed him with the Cross, and said to
him: &quot;Go, take her by the hand, and say to her, 'I with my hand slew thee
with iron, but Jesus with His grace raiseth thee up by my faith.'&quot; And the youth went (and) stood over
her, and said: &quot;I have in truth believed in Thee, my Lord Jesus the
Messiah, the gift of Thy Father, that in Thee are all aids, and in Thee all
dispensations, and in Thee all healings, and in Thee life for the repentant,
who in truth repent unto Thee with all their heart. Yea, my Lord, I beg of Thy
mercy, come to my help and to my conversion, and give life to this (woman) by
my hands, since I dare to do this.&quot; And he was looking upon Judas Thomas
and saying to him: &quot;Pray for me, Apostle of God, that my Lord may come to
my aid, on whom I call.&quot; And he laid his hand upon hers, and said:
&quot;Come, my Lord Jesus the Messiah, and give to this (woman) life and to me
the pledge of Thy faith.&quot; And as soon as he took hold of her hand, she
sprang up (and) stood upright, and was looking on the great crowd who were
standing by. And she saw the Apostle of our Lord, who was standing opposite to
her, and ran and fell down at his feet, and took hold of his skirts, and saith
to him: &quot;I pray thee, sir, where is the other, who was with thee, who did
not let me remain in that place which I saw, but gave me over to thee, and said
to thee, 'Take this (woman) away unto thee, that she may be made perfect in her
love by faith, and then be gathered unto my place.'&quot;</p>

<p>Judas saith to her: &quot;Tell me whither
thou wentest and what thou didst see?&quot; She saith to him: &quot;Thou, who
wast with me, and to whom he gave me over, dost thou ask to hear of me?&quot;
And she began to tell him, (saying): &quot;A man, whose aspect was hideous, and
his body black, and his clothes filthy, took me away and carried me to a place
which was full of pits, and a stinking smell too was diffused in its midst. And
he made me look down into each of the pits; and I saw the first pit, and as it
were fire was blazing in its midst, and wheels of fire were revolving in its
midst; and he said to me: 'Into this torment are destined to come those souls
which transgress the law, which change the union of intercourse that has been
appointed by God; and other (souls) are destined to come into this torment,
which have not preserved their virginity, and have given themselves up to the
deed of shame, and they shall come to this affliction, because they have
transgressed the law of God, and shall be given over to evil spirits, and shall
be for a mockery and a derision, and retribution shall be (exacted) from them,
and they shall go into another torment, which is worse than this, and shall be
tormented there.' And again he showed me another pit, and I looked down into it
and saw dreadful things, to which are destined to come the souls that do evil;
and I saw there many tortures which are prepared for men and women and youths
and maidens. Those men who leave their own wives, and have intercourse with the
wives of their fellows; and women, who go beyond intercourse with their own
husbands; and youths, who do not keep their laws, wantonly indulge themselves
with harlots in their lust, and for whom it is not enough to transgress the law
among harlots, but they lie in wait for virgins and wantonly indulge in sin;
and maidens, who have not kept their state of virginity, (but), because of
their wanton lust, have brought shame upon their parents; — (these) shall come
to this affliction and shall be recompensed, each according to his works. And
he took me away again; and showed me a dark cave, and a stinking smell was
coming out of it. And he said to me: ' Look down and see, for this is the
prison of those souls about which I said to thee that, when the chastisement of
each of them is finished, another cometh in its place; and there are some of
them which are utterly consumed, and there are some of them which are handed
over to other tortures.' The guardians of those tortures say to the man who
led me: 'Give us this (woman), that we may bind her in her place, until she
goes to her torture.' The man who led me saith to them: 'I will not give her to
you, because I am afraid of Him who delivered her to me, and I was not ordered
to leave her here; but I will take her up with me, until I receive an order
regarding her.' And he took me and brought me out to the place where men were;
and he who was like to thee took me and delivered me unto thee, and said to
thee: 'Take this (woman), because she is one of the sheep that have gone astray.'
And thou didst take me from him, and lo, I stand before thee, and beg of thee
that I too may believe through thee, and may find grace because of thy prayer,
and that I too may not go to those tortures which I have seen.&quot;</p>

<p>Judas Thomas saith to them: &quot;Ye have
heard, my children, what this woman hath said; and there are not these tortures
only, but also others, which are much worse than these. Ye too, therefore,
unless ye are converted to this truth which I preach, and restrain yourselves
from your evil deeds, and from your actions which profit you not, and from your
thoughts without knowledge, your end will come to these torments. But do ye,
therefore, believe in Jesus the Messiah, and He will blot out your former
actions, and will cleanse you from all your earthly thoughts that abide on the
earth, and will purify you from your sins, which, unless ye repent of them unto
God, will accompany you and go with you and be found before you. Put off,
therefore, each of you, his old man, and put on the new man, that is to say,
(put off) your old courses and your fleshly works. Let those, then, who stole,
steal no more, but toil and work and live; and let those of you who committed
adultery, not commit adultery and abandon themselves to the ease of the moment,
that they may not go to everlasting torment, for adultery is hateful before God
more than all evil works; and put away from you lying and oppression and
drunkenness and slander, and requite not any man evil for evil; for all these
things are odious to this God whom I preach, and unclean to him; but walk in
all humility and temperance and purity, and in hope in God, and ye shall become
servants of Him, and shall receive from Him the gifts which are given to some
(only.)&quot;</p>

<p>And these multitudes believed, and
surrendered themselves to the living God and to Jesus the Messiah, and were
enjoying the blessed works of the Most High and His holy service; and were each
of them bringing much money for the relief of the widows, who were collected by
the Apostle in each city, and to all of whom he was sending by the hand of his
deacons what was fitting for them for food and clothing. And he never ceased to
preach and to speak unto them, and to show them that it was Jesus the Messiah
of whom the Scriptures spake, and whose types and mysteries and likenesses
the Law and the Prophets showed forth; who was given as a covenant to the
people (of Israel), that they might be restrained for His sake from the worship
of idols, and as a light to the peoples (the Gentiles), by means of which the
grace of God hath dawned upon them, and all those who keep His commandments
shall find rest in His kingdom, and be honoured in glory; and He came, and was
crucified, and rose in three days. And he was narrating unto them, and
expounding, from Moses even unto the end of the prophets, because they all
preached concerning Him, and He came (and) fulfilled (all) in fact.</p>

<p>And the report of him was heard among men
in the cities and villages; and every man who had a sick (person), or one
possessed by a spirit, or a lunatic, or paralytics,—some they brought on beds
and placed them by the road-side, whithersoever they learned that he was going;
and he was healing them all by the power of Jesus his Lord. And the sick, who
were ill of grievous diseases and in hideous torments, were healed, and the
paralytics, who were standing up quite sound; and they were all glorifying
(God) with one mouth, and saying: &quot;To Thee be glory, Jesus the Messiah,
who hast given us healing by Thy servant and Thy Apostle Judas. For lo, being
quite well and seeing, we pray of Thee that we too may become children of Thy
fold, and may be numbered among the number of Thy sheep. Receive us, our Lord,
and reckon not against us our former sins, which we committed in
ignorance.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, when Judas Thomas saw them, he
lifted up his voice and said: &quot;To thee be glory, Living (One) who (art)
from the Living (One); to Thee be glory, Life-giver of many; to Thee be glory,
Help and Aider of those who come to Thy place of refuge; to Thee be glory, (Thou
that art) wakeful from all eternity, and the Awaker of men, living and making
alive. Thou art God, the Son of God, the Saviour and Helper, and Refuge, and
Best of all those who are weary in Thy work; the Giver of rest to those who,
for Thy name's sake, have borne the burden of the whole day at mid-day. We
praise Thee for Thy gift unto us, and for Thy aids to our feebleness, and for
Thy provision for our poverty. Make perfect with us Thy grace and Thy mercy
unto the end, and give us the boldness that is in Thee. Behold, Lord, that Thee
alone we love; and behold, Lord, that we have left our homes and the homes of
these our kindred, and for  Thy sake are become strangers without compulsion.
Behold, Lord, that we have left our possessions for Thy sake, that we might
gain Thee, the possession of life, that cannot be taken away. Behold, our Lord,
that we have left all our kindred for Thy sake, that we might be united in
kinship to Thee. Behold, our Lord, that we have left our fathers and our
mothers and our fosterers, that we might see Thy exalted Father and be filled
with His divine nourishment. Behold, our Lord, that we have left our fleshly
wives and earthly fruits, that we might be united in true union with Thee and
produce the heavenly fruits which (are) from above, which men cannot take away
from us, but which shall be with us and we shall be with them.&quot;</p>

<p align=center>Here ends the sixth Act.</p>

<p align=center>The seventh Act, how Judas
Thomas was called by the General of king Mazdai to heal his Wife and Daughter.</p>

<p>AND whilst Judas was preaching throughout
all India, the general of a king came to him and said to him: &quot;I pray
thee, servant of God, and the more so that thou seest that I myself am come to
thee as unto the Apostle of God, because thou art sent for the healing of men
who have need of the aid which is given them by thy hands; and I have heard
concerning thee that thou takest no fee from any man, but providest for the
poor, for if thou tookest a fee, I would have sent thee a large sum of money,
and I would not have come hither, because the king doth naught without me; for
I have abundance and am rich, and am a great man throughout all India, and I
have done no wrong to any man, but this thing hath happened to me contrary (to
my deserts). I have a wife, and by her I had a daughter; and I love her much,
as nature too teacheth, and I know no other wife along with her. Now there
chanced to be a banquet in our city, and the givers of the entertainment were
great friends of mine; and they came (and) asked of me, and prepared the feast
for her and her daughter. And because they were friends of mine, I could not
make any excuse, but I sent her, though against her will, and I sent with her
also many of my servants, and I made a great display for her and her daughter. And
when it was time to depart, I sent after her lanterns and lamps; and I too was
standing in the street and was looking when she should come, that I might see
her and receive her and her daughter with her. And whilst I was standing there,
I heard a sound of lamentation and a sound of weeping; 'Alas for her, alas for
her,' was coming to. my ears from all mouths. Then my servants came to me,
rending their clothes, and made known to me what had happened, and say to me:
'We saw a man, and another, a boy, was with him, who was like to him. And the
man laid his hand upon thy wife, and the boy upon thy daughter; and they shrank
with loathing from them, and we smote them with swords, but our swords sank to
the ground; and at that moment the women fell down, and were gnashing their
teeth, and dashing their heads on the ground; and we are come to inform thee of
what hath happened.' And when I had heard these things from my servants, I rent
my clothes, and was beating my face with my hands; and running about in the street
like a madman. And I came and found them lying in the street; and I took them
and brought them to my house, and after a long time they came to themselves;
and I restored (them and) made them sit up, and began to ask my wife: 'What
hath happened to thee?' And she saith to me: 'Thou dost not know what thou
hast done with me; for I asked of thee that I might not go to the feast,
because I was not well in body; and as I was going along the street, and had
come to the pipe that throweth up water, I saw a black man standing opposite to
me and shaking his head, and another, a boy, who was like to him, standing
beside him; and I said to my daughter: 'Look at these men, how hideous (they
are);' and my daughter said to me, 'I saw a boy whose teeth were like milk
and his lips like coals.' And we left them beside the water-pipe and went on.
And when it was evening, and we quitted the house where the entertainment was,
and came away with the servants, and arrived at the water-pipe, my daughter saw
them first, and came to me for refuge; and after her I too saw them coming
towards us; and the servants who were with me fled; and they struck me and my
daughter, and threw us down.' And whilst she was narrating (this) to me, they
came upon them, and cast them down again; and from that hour they are unable to
go out any more into the street, either to go to the bath, or to the house of
feasting, or the house of weeping, but they lie there night and day, the mother
with her daughter, and are shut up by me in a room within another, because of
the laughing-stock that I am become through them, and because, when they come
upon them, they throw them down and disgrace them wherever they find them. I
beg therefore of thee and entreat thee, help me and have mercy upon me, for,
lo, for three years no table hath been laid in my house, and my wife and
daughter have not sat at it; but specially for my poor daughter's sake, who
hath had no pleasure (of her life).&quot; And when the Apostle had heard these
things from the general, he was very sorry for him, and said to him: &quot;If
thou believest in my Lord Jesus the Messiah that He can heal them, thou shalt
see their recovery.&quot; The general, when he had heard these things, saith to
him, because he imagined that he was Jesus: &quot;I believe that thou canst
heal them.&quot; The Apostle saith to him: &quot;I am not Jesus, but His
servant and His Apostle. Commit then thyself to Him, and He will heal them and
help them.&quot; The general saith to him: &quot;Show me how I can ask Him and
believe in Him.&quot; The Apostle saith to him: &quot;As far as thou art able,
stretch thy mind upward, because He is not visible now to these bodily eyes,
but by faith is recognised in His works and glorified in His healings.&quot;
And the general lifted up his voice and said: &quot;I believe in Thee, Jesus
the Messiah, God, that Thou art the Living, the Son of the Living, and didst
become man, and didst appear (as) a Healer and Life-giver and Saviour for all
those who in truth repent unto Thee. Yea, Lord, I beg of Thee and intercede
before Thee; help my little faith and my fear, for with Thee I take
refuge.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Apostle commanded his deacon
Xanthippus to assemble  all the brethren who were there. And when he had
assembled them, the Apostle came and stood in their midst, and said to them:
&quot;My sons and brethren and sisters in our Lord Jesus, abide in this faith,
and trust in our Lord Jesus the Messiah, Him whom I preach unto you; and let
your hope be in Him, and He will keep you; and fall not away from Him, because
He will not forsake you. And if it be that ye sleep that sleep, which when a
man sleeps, he is not, He will not sleep, but will be wakeful and preserve you.
And if ye sit in a ship and on the sea, where no man of you is able to help his
fellow, He will walk upon the waves of the sea and support your ship. Because I
then am going away from you, and I do not know if I shall see you again in the
body, be not ye, therefore, like to the children of Israel, who stumbled,
because Moses, their shepherd for a time, departed from them. But lo, I leave
you in my stead the deacon Xanthippus, and he too will preach Jesus the Messiah
like me. For I too am a man like one of you, and I have no wealth, which is
found with some, the end of which is that it destroyeth him who possesseth it,
because there is no utility</p>

<p>in it, since it leaveth him in the earth,
from which he came, and the transgressions and sins which he committed for its
sake are with him; for there are (only) some who are rich and charitable.
Neither have I any human comeliness, on which all those who place their
reliance are quickly brought to shame; for if he who had beauty becometh
deprived (of it), his beauty availeth him nought, but those who loved him
because of his beauty, they especially shun him with loathing; for all things
which are of the world are loved in their season and hated in their season. But
let your hope be in Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, and be ye holding fast
by us and looking to us, as the servants of God, since we too, if we bear not
the burden that beseemeth this name, shall receive punishment, and it shall be
to us for judgement and vengeance.&quot;</p>

<p>And he prayed with them a long prayer, and committed them to our Lord, and said: &quot;Lord of all orders of
creation,&quot; which await Thee, and God of all spirits, which hope in Thee,
(Thou) that deliverest from error Thy human beings, (and) freest from
corruption and from slavery those who obey Thee and come to Thy place of
refuge; be Thou with the flock of Xanthippus, and anoint his flock with Thy oil
of life, and cleanse it of its disease, and guard it from wolves and from
robbers, that they may not snatch it out of his hands.&quot; And he laid his
hand upon them, and said to them: &quot;The peace of Jesus be with you, and go
with us also.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Apostle set out to go on the way;
and all of them were accompanying him with weeping, and were conjuring him by
his Lord to be mindful of them in his prayers and not to forget them. And when
the Apostle had mounted, he sat in the chariot of the general, and all the
brethren remained behind. The general came and said to the driver: &quot;I am
praying that I may be worthy to sit beneath the feet of the Son of God, Jesus
the Messiah, and to be His driver on this road, which many know, that He may be
my guide on that road on which some (only) shall go.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had gone about a mile, Judas
Thomas begged of the general, and made him get up to sit beside him, and
ordered the driver to sit in his place. And as they were going along the road,
and Judas was conversing with the general, the cattle became tired from their
having driven them so far, and stood still and would not stir. And the general
was sorely vexed, and knew not what to do; and he thought of running on foot,
and bringing other cattle, wherever he could get them, or horses, because his
time was becoming short. And when the Apostle saw this, he said to him:
&quot;Be not afraid and be not agitated, but only believe in Jesus, as I told
thee, and thou shalt see great wonders.&quot; The general saith to him: &quot;I
believe in Him, (and) that everything is possible for him to do who asketh of
Him.&quot;</p>

<p>Now Judas saw a herd of wild asses feeding
some distance off the highway, and he said to the general: &quot;If thou
believest in Jesus, go to the herd and say to them: 'Judas, the Apostle of
Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, saith, Let four of you come, for I require
them.'&quot; And the general went,
fearing greatly, because they were many; and the more he went on, (the more)
they came towards him. And when they were close to him, he said to them:
&quot;Judas Thomas, the Apostle of Jesus the Messiah, saith: 'Let four of you
come to me, because I require them.'&quot;And when they heard this speech, all , the asses came to him with a great
rush; and when they came to him, they bowed down unto him by the direction of
our Lord.</p>

<p>And Judas Thomas, the Apostle of our Lord,
lifted up his voice in praise, and said:  &quot;Glorious art Thou, God of truth
and Lord of all natures, for Thou didst will with Thy Will, and make all Thy
works, and finish all Thy creatures,  and bring  them  to  the  rule of their nature,
and lay upon them all Thy fear, that they might be subject to Thy command. And
Thy Will trod the path from Thy secrecy to manifestation, and was caring for
every soul that Thou didst make, and was spoken of by the mouth of all the
prophets, in all visions and sounds and voices; but Israel did not obey because
of their evil inclination. And Thou, because Thou art Lord of all, hast a care
for the creatures, so that Thou spreadest over us Thy mercy in Him who came by
Thy will and put on the body, Thy creature, which Thou didst will and form
according to Thy glorious wisdom.    He whom Thou didst appoint in Thy secrecy
and establish in Thy manifestation, to Him Thou hast given the name of Son He
who was Thy Will, the Power of Thy thought; so that Ye are by various names,
the Father and the Son and the Spirit, for the sake of the government of Thy
creatures, for the nourishing of all natures, and Ye are one in glory and power
and will; and Ye are divided without being separated, and are one though
divided; and all subsists in Thee and is subject to Thee, because all is Thine.
And I rely upon Thee, Lord, and by Thy command have subjected these dumb
beasts, that Thou mightest show Thy ministering power upon us and upon them, 
because it is needful, and that Thy name might be glorified in us and in the
beasts that cannot speak.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had said these things, he said
to the wild asses: &quot;Peace be with you, because ye have obeyed the Word,
the sovereign of all. Let four of you come and be yoked in place of these cattle,
which have stood still and arc not able to go on.&quot; And every one of the
wild asses crowded round, (striving) which of them should be yoked. And there
were some there, that were stronger than their fellows, and these were yoked;
and the rest of them went along after and before the Apostle. And when they had
proceeded a little way, he said to them: &quot;To you I speak, ye inhabitants
of the desert; remain behind and go to your pasture; for if I had had
occasion for you all, ye would all have come. Now then go to the place in which
ye were.&quot; And the wild asses were going along gently, until they were out
of his sight.</p>

<p>And the Apostle was seated (in the
chariot), and the general, and the driver; and the wild asses were going along
gently and quietly and by little and little, that the Apostle of God might not
be shaken. And when they reached the gate of the city, they (viz. the asses)
distinguished (the house), and went (and) stood before the gate of the
court-yard of the general. <i> </i>Then the general was amazed and said:
&quot;I am not able to speak and tell what is happening; but let there be
another wonder, and then I will tell.&quot; And the whole city was coming,
because they saw the wild asses which had been yoked in the chariot, and because
they heard the report of the Apostle's having gone thither.</p>

<p>The Apostle saith to the general:
&quot;Where is thy house? And whither wilt thou conduct us?&quot; The general
saith to him: &quot;Thou knowest that thou art standing at the door of thy
servant, and these (beasts), which by thy command are come with thee, know
better than I.&quot; And when the general had spoken thus, he sprang down from
the chariot.</p>

<p>And the Apostle began to say: &quot;Jesus,
the knowledge of whom is denied in this country; Jesus, the report of whom is strange
in this city; Jesus, a stranger among these men; Jesus, who sendest Thy Apostle
on before to every country and every city, and art glorified in him and made
known by him to all those who are worthy of it; Jesus, who didst put on the
body, and become man, and appear to us all, that we might not part from Thy
love; our Lord, who didst give Thyself for us, and buy us with Thy blood, and
acquire us unto Thyself, a possession that was dearly bought;—for what have we
that we can give to Him for His life? For He gave His life for us. It is not
anything that belongs to each one (of us), nor does He ask of us anything, save
that we should ask of Him and live.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had said these things, many
were coming from every place to see the Apostle of the new God, who was come
thither. And Judas said: &quot;Why stand we here and are idle? Jesus, what wilt
Thou? Command the time, and let the deed be (done).&quot; Then the demons were
sore upon that woman and her daughter, and the servants of the general did not
think that they would last, for they did not suffer them to eat anything, but
kept them constantly lying in bed, without being recognised by anyone, until
the day when the Apostle came thither.</p>

<p>And the Apostle said to one of the wild
asses which were yoked on the right hand: &quot;Go into the court-yard, and,
standing there, call those demons, and say to them: 'Judas the Apostle, the
disciple of Jesus the Messiah, saith, Come out hither, because on your account
I have been sent and against your kindred, that I might drive you to your own
place, ere the time of the consummation cometh and ye go to your pit.'&quot; And the wild ass went in, a crowd
of people being with him, and said: &quot;To you I speak, ye enemies of
mankind; to you I speak, who close your eyes to the light that ye may not see,
for the nature of evil cannot be with good; to you I speak, offspring of
Gehenna and Abaddon, children of him who hath never been forced to keep quiet
until today, of him who produceth afresh evil servants that suit his nature; to
you I speak, audacious wretches, who are to perish by your own hands. And what
I should say concerning your end, I know not; and what I should tell, I am
unable (to utter); for these things are too great for hearing and have no
limit, for however great your bodies may be, they are too small for your
retributions. To thee I speak, demon, and to thy son, who accompanieth thee,
for now I am sent hither against you. &quot;Why do I go on speaking at great
length of your nature? For ye know (it) better than I, and are audacious. But
now Judas Thomas, the disciple of Jesus the Messiah, this (man) who hath been
sent hither with mercy and grace, saith: 'Come forth unto this crowd, which,
lo, is standing here, and tell me of what race ye are.' &quot;</p>

<p>And at that moment the woman and her daughter
came out, like to the dead in appearance, and exposed, and disgraced. And when
the Apostle saw them, he Was grieved for them, and said: &quot;No pity hath
been shown unto you; on this account ye are scarcely conscious. But in the name
of Jesus the Messiah depart ye from them, and stand beside them.&quot; And when
the Apostle had uttered  this speech, the women fell down and (to all
appearance) died, for there was no breath in them, nor did they utter any
sound. And the demon cried with a loud voice and said: &quot;Thou art come
again, rebuker of our nature! Thou art come hither again, destroyer of our
race! Thou art come hither again, effacer of our footsteps! And, as I see, thou
dost not wish to let us remain on earth; but thou art not able at this time to
do this to us.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas perceived that it was the demon
whom he had driven out of that (other) woman. And he said to him: &quot;I beg
of thee, then, give me leave, (and) I will go whither thou pleasest (and) dwell
(there); and I will take orders from thee, and not be afraid of him who hath
authority over me; for as thou art come to visit (and do good), so am I come to
destroy; and as thou, if thou dost not accomplish the will of Him who sent
thee, art reproved, so I too, unless I do the will of him who sent me, go before
the time unto our nature; and as thy Lord helpeth thee in the things which thou
dost, (so) too my father supporteth me in the things which I do; and as He
prepareth for thee vessels which are worthy for Him to dwell in, so too he
maketh me aware of the vessels which obey him, that I may do in them his will;
and as He nourisheth and provideth for thee and for those who obey thee, so
also doth He torture me, and torment me and those in whom I dwell; and as to
thee He giveth the reward of thy work, that is to say life everlasting, (so)
also to me He giveth the recompense of my deeds, everlasting perdition; and as
thou takest pleasure in thy prayers, and in thy good works, and in the
Eucharist, and in His chants of praise and psalms and hymns, so I too take
pleasure in murder and adultery, and in sacrifices and libations of wine on
the altars; and as thou turnest men unto everlasting life, so I too turn men
unto me, unto everlasting perdition and torment; and thou receivest thy reward,
and I mine.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the demon had said these things,
the Apostle said: &quot;To thee and to thy son Jesus saith by me, that ye shall
not again enter the habitation of men, but go (and) dwell without the entire
habitation of men.&quot; And the demons say unto him: &quot;Lo, we go, as thou hast
commanded us; but what wilt thou do unto those who are hidden from thee, and
their vessels rejoice, in them more than in thee,—those whom many worship and
do their will, sacrificing unto them and pouring out unto them wine as a
libation, and offering unto them offerings?&quot; The Apostle saith: &quot;They
too shall perish in the end with their worshippers.&quot; And the demons were
sought and were not found; but the women were lying (there) as if dead, without
a word; and the wild asses were standing one beside the other, and were not
moving away from one another; but the one to whom speech was given by the power
of our Lord, was standing in front of his fellows.</p>

<p>And when all the people were silent and
looking on him, that they might see what the Apostle would do, the wild ass
looked on them all, and said to Judas: &quot;Why standest thou (there) and art
idle, Apostle of the Most High?   For lo, the Paraclete is standing beside thee
and looking that thou shouldest ask him and he would give unto thee. Why
delayest thou, good Disciple?  For lo, thy Master wisheth to show great things
through thee. Why standest thou (there), preacher of the Hidden? For lo, thy
Master wisheth to disclose His hidden nature through thee unto those who are
worthy of Him that they may hear these things. Why art thou still, worker of
miracles in the name of thy Lord? For lo, thy Lord is standing by and
encouraging thee. Fear not; for He will not abandon thee, and His Godhead will
not suffer thy manhood to be grieved. Begin, therefore, to call upon Him, and
He will answer thee, as He is wont at all times. Why doth amazement seize thee
at His manifold doings?  For these are small things which He hath shown through
thee; and if thou wert to tell of the number of His gifts, thou wouldest not be
able to make an end of them. Why art thou astonished concerning these His
bodily healings, (which are) ended by dissolution, when thou rememberest His
healing of His possessions, which is not ended by dissolution? Why ponderest
thou upon this temporal life, when, lo, thou canst reflect every day upon the
life everlasting? But unto you, I say, ye multitudes, who, lo, are standing by
and waiting to see these arise who, lo, are lying here; believe on the Teacher
of verity, and believe on the Shewer of truths; believe on the Revealer of
secrets; believe on the Demonstrator of life; believe on the Apostle of the
tried Son, Jesus the Messiah, who was born, that the born might live by His
birth; and was reared, that the perfect rearing might be seen in Him; and went
to school, that through Him perfect wisdom might be known; He taught His
teacher,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> because He was the Teacher of verity and the Master of the wise; he
went to the temple and offered an offering, that they might see that all
offerings are sanctified in Him. This is the Apostle of Him; this is the
Apostle of truth; this is the doer of the will of Him that sent him. But there
shall be a time when false apostles shall come, and lying prophets, whose end
shall be like their works; who will say unto you,  'Beware of sins,' whilst
they at all times utter sins; who will put on the clothing of lambs, whilst
within they are ravening wolves; who will not take one wife legally, but by
their words and their deeds will corrupt many women; who will not beget
children, but will corrupt many children, and pay the penalty for them; who
will be distressed at the happiness of others, and will take pleasure in their
distress; to whom what they possess will not suffice, but who will desire that
all things should serve them, and will boast of them, and be esteemed as
disciples of the Messiah; in whose mouth is one thing, and in their heart
another; who teach that ye should shun hateful things, but themselves do not
even a single good thing; before whom adultery is hateful, and theft, and oppression,
and greed, but in themselves secretly these are all done, whilst they teach
that a man should not do them.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he spake these things, all the
wild asses were looking at him. And when he was silent, Judas said: &quot;What
am I to think of Thy servant, Jesus? And how I am to call Thee, I know not. O
(Thou) gentle and silent and still and speaking! (Thou) Seer, that art in the
heart, and Searcher, that art in the mind! Glory to Thee, (Thou) gracious
(One)! Glory to Thee, living Word! Glory to Thee, (Thou) hidden (One), who hast
many forms! Glory to Thy mercy, which hath abounded unto us. Glory to Thy
grace, which hath been upon us! Glory to Thy greatness, which became small for
us! Glory to Thy exaltation, which was humbled for us! Glory to Thy strength,
which became feeble for us! Glory to Thy Godhead, which for us put on manhood!</p>

<p>Glory to Thy manhood, which was made new
for us, and died for us to give us life ! Glory to Thy Resurrection from the
grave, that we might have a resurrection and a raising up! Glory to Thy
Ascension unto Heaven, by which Thou didst tread for us the road (leading) up
on high! And Thou didst promise and swear unto us, that we should sit on the
right hand and on the left, and should be judges with Thee. Thou art the Word
of Heaven. Thou art the hidden Light of the understanding, and the Study of
the path of truth, the Dispeller of darkness and the Destroyer of error.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the Apostle had said these
things, he came and stood over those women, who were lying (there), and said :
&quot;My Lord and my God, Jesus the Messiah, I doubt not regarding Thee, but I
call upon Thee, as at all times Thou dost aid us and support us and encourage
us. Thou Giver of freedom of speech and of joy unto Thy servant and Apostle,
let these (women) be healed b and arise, and let them be as they were before
they were smitten by the demons.&quot; And when he had said these things, the
women turned over, and sat up healed. And Judas commanded the general that his
servants should take them and lead them in and give them food, for they had not
eaten for many days. And when they had taken them and led them in, he said to
the wild asses, &quot;Follow me.&quot; And they went after him until he had
brought them without the gate. And when they had gone out, he said to them:
&quot;Go in peace to your pasture.&quot; And the wild asses were going along
gently, and the Apostle was standing and looking at them, lest perchance any
man should hurt them, until<br>
they had got out of his sight and were no longer visible to him. </p>

<p align=center>Here ends the seventh Act.</p>

<p align=center>The eighth Act, of Mygdonia and
Kar&#299;sh.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></p>

<p>AND Judas returned from (accompanying)
them, and went to the house of the general, and a great multitude with him. And
it happened that a woman, (the wife) of a kinsman of the king, whose name was
Mygdonia, had come to see the new sight of the new God who was preached, and
the new Apostle who was come to their country; and she was sitting in a
palanquin, and her servants were carrying her. And because of the great press
that there was, they were unable to bring her near to him; and she sent to her
husband, and he sent his officers, and they were going before her, and pressing
back the people. And the Apostle saw (this) and said to them: &quot;Why do ye
ill-treat these (people), who are coming to hear the word? And (why are) ye
anxious that they should pass on, and ye yourselves wish to come unto me, being
very far off? For our Lord said to those multitudes who were coming unto him:
'Ears ye have, and ye hear not, and eyes ye have, and ye see not'; and (He also
said): 'Come unto me, all ye that are weary and bearing burdens, and I will
give you rest.' &quot; And he looked upon those men and said: &quot;Now the
blessing that was given unto these falleth to the share of you who are
carrying; for ye are bearing a heavy burden, and she directeth you by her
command. Though God hath made you men, men make you carry a heavy load like
beasts; and those who are borne upon you, think in their minds that ye are not
men like to them, and do not know that all men are equal before God, whether
they be slaves or free; and righteous is the judgement of God, which shall come
upon all souls that are on the earth, and no man shall escape from it, neither
slaves nor free, nor rich nor poor. Those who have, shall not be profited aught
thereby; and those who have not, shall not be delivered by their poverty from
this judgement. For we are not commanded to do anything which we are unable to
do, nor to take up heavy burdens, nor to build buildings, which carpenters
build for themselves with wisdom, nor (to practise) the art of hewing stones,
which stonecutters know as their craft; but (we are commanded to do) something
which we can do,—to refrain  from fornication, the head of all evils; and from
murder, by reason of which the curse came upon Cain; and from theft, which
brought Judas Iscariot unto hanging; and from gluttony, which removed Esau from
his birthright; and from covetousness, unto which when one is subject, he doth
not consider what he doeth; and from vain-glory, and from destroying slander;
and from evil actions; and from deeds of shame, and from hateful intercourse
and unclean connection, in which there is eternal condemnation; and this it is
that seizeth the uplifted by force, and casteth them down to the lowest depth,
and bringeth them under its power, so that they cannot discern what they do,
and their  works   become   hidden from them. But harken ye to me, and conduct
yourselves with purity, which is chosen before God more than all good things;
and with temperance, for it showeth us intercourse with God, and giveth eternal
life. And also conduct yourselves with humility, for this is weighed with every
(virtue), and is heavy, and outweigheth (them), and gaineth the crown; and with
gentleness, and stretching out of the hand to the poor, and supplying the wants
of the needy; but especially it behoveth you to conduct yourselves with purity,
for this is chosen before God, and maketh (us) enter into everlasting life, for
it is the head of all virtues, and by it are done all good works; for he who is
not purified, is unable to do anything good, because all the virtues are after
this of purity. For purity is seen of God, and destroyeth evil. Purity is
pleasing to God; therefore it proceedeth from him. Purity is the athlete who is
not overcome. Purity is the truth that blencheth not. Purity is the tower that
falleth not. Purity is worthy before God of being to Him a familiar handmaiden.
Purity is comeliness when it is found with many. Purity destroyeth corruption.
Purity is the messenger of concord, which bringeth the tidings of peace.
Temperance setteth him who acquireth it free from daily cares. Temperance
careth for naught but how it may be found pleasing to its Lord. Temperance
holdeth on by hope, awaiting deliverance. Temperance sitteth at all times in
tranquillity, because it doth nothing that is odious. Temperance seeketh a life
of rest, and is a joy to all who acquire it, and exalteth those who are nigh to
it. Humility hath subdued Death, and brought him under its power. Humility hath
conquered enmity. Humility is the pleasant yoke, and fatigueth not those who
bear it.    Humility feareth naught, for it is rude to none. Humility is
concord and peace and joy and rest. Acquire purity, and take unto you 
temperance, and strive after humility; for by these three cardinal virtues is
typified this Messiah, whom I preach. For purity is the temple of God, and
every one who guardeth it, guardeth His temple,  and the Messiah dwelleth in
him. And temperance is the rest of God; for our Lord fasted forty days and
forty nights, and tasted  nothing; and the Messiah dwelleth in him who
observeth it. And humility is a mighty power; for our Lord said unto Simon the
Apostle: 'Return thy sword back (to its sheath); if I am willing to ask strength
of my Father, He will give me more than twelve legions of angels.' &quot;</p>

<p>And when Judas had said these things, all
the multitudes were  listening  together, and trampling  on one another. And
the wife of Kar&#299;sh, the kinsman of king Mazdai, sprang up and came out of
the palanquin, and fell down on the ground before the feet of the Apostle, and
was begging of him and saying to him: &quot;I beg of thee, thou Apostle of the
new God, who hast come to a desert place from the habitation of men — for we
dwell in a desert, because we live like the beasts that have not speech, and
now, lo, we are being tamed by thy hands, — that thou wouldst turn unto me too,
and pray for me, that I also may obtain grace from this God whom thou
preachest, and that I may become a handmaiden of Him, and that I too may be
united with you in prayer and in hope and in thanksgiving, and that I too may
become a holy temple and He may dwell in me.&quot;</p>

<p>The Apostle saith: &quot;I pray and beg of
you, my brethren in our Lord and my sisters in the Messiah, that the word of
the Messiah may dwell in you all and abide in you, because ye are given power
over your own souls.&quot; And he began to say to the woman: &quot;Mygdonia,
arise from the ground, and be mindful of thyself, and be not concerned about
thy ornaments, which pass away, nor about the beauty of thy person, which
perisheth, nor about thy dress, nor about this name and dignity in the world
that passeth away; and degrade not thyself to this filthy intercourse,  and be
deprived of the true fellowship. For ornaments perish, and beauty becometh old
and marred, and clothes decay, and power passeth away, (accompanied) with
punishment, according as each person hath conducted himself in it, and marriage
passeth away with much contempt.   Jesus alone abideth, and those who hope in
Him and take refuge (with  Him),  and  deliver up  themselves   unto 
Him.&quot; And when he had  said these things, he said to  the woman: &quot;Go
in peace, and may our Lord make thee worthy of His divine mysteries.&quot; She
saith to him: &quot;I am afraid to go, lest thou leave me and depart to another
place.&quot; The Apostle  saith to her: &quot;Jesus will not abandon thee for
His mercy's sake.&quot; And she bowed down and prostrated herself before  him, 
because  she thought that he was Jesus; and she went home rejoicing.</p>

<p>Now Kar&#299;sh, the kinsman of king
Mazdai, had taken his bath and gone to supper; and he was asking for his wife,
where she was, that she had not come to meet him from her chamber. And her
maidens said to him: &quot;She is not inclined (to come).&quot; And he went
into the chamber, and saw her lying on the bed with her face covered. And he
kissed her, and said to her: &quot;Why art thou sad today and sorrowful?&quot;
She saith to him: &quot;I am very tired.&quot; He saith to her: &quot;Why didst
thou not pay proper respect to thy position as a free woman, and stay at home,
and not go and hear vain words and (see) deeds of witchcraft? But get up, and
come out, and sup with me, for I cannot sup without thee.&quot; Mygdonia saith
to him: &quot;Today I must be excused from supping with thee and from sleeping
with thee, for I am much agitated.&quot; And when Kar&#299;sh heard from
Mygdonia that she spake to him thus, he was unwilling to quit (the room) to
sleep or to sup; but ordered his servants to bring (food) to him that he might
sup in her presence.</p>

<p>And when they had brought in (food, and)
set it before him, he asked her to sup, but she would not; and since she would
not sup, he supped alone. And Kar&#299;sh said to her: &quot;On thy account I
excused myself to my lord, king Mazdai, from (staying to) supper, and thou dost
not choose to sup with me!&quot; Mygdonia saith to him: &quot;Because I am not
inclined.&quot; And he stood up to go to bed and sleep as was his wont, and she
said to him: &quot;Did I not tell thee that I must be excused today, that I
may sleep alone?&quot;</p>

<p>And when he heard this speech, he went and
slept in another bed. And when he awoke suddenly from his sleep, he said to
her: &quot;My lady and sister Mygdonia, harken unto a dream which I saw this
night. I saw myself reclining in the presence of my lord king Mazdai, and a
table was laid before us. And I saw an eagle swoop down from heaven, and carry
off from before me and from before king Mazdai a brace of partridges; and he
bore them up to his nest and placed them there, and came again and hovered over
us. And king Mazdai bade them bring him a bow. And the eagle came again, and
carried off again from before us a pigeon and a turtle-dove. And king Mazdai
shot an arrow at him, and it passed through him from side to side, and did not
harm him; but he soared away to his nest. And I started (out of my sleep),
being agitated, and being vexed on account of the partridge which I had tasted,
and of which he did not let me put any more into my mouth, and lo, its taste
was in my mouth.&quot; Mygdonia saith to him: &quot;Thy dream is good; for thou
eatest partridges every day, but perchance a partridge had never been tasted
by that eagle until now.&quot; </p>

<p>And when it was morning, Kar&#299;sh, the
kinsman of king Mazdai, arose early (and) dressed, and put his left shoe on his
right foot, and said to Mygdonia: &quot;What is this action? Lo, the dream and
the action!&quot; Mygdonia saith to him: &quot;This too is not unlucky, but
good; from an unlucky thing something else good results.&quot; And he washed
his hands, and went to salute king Mazdai.    </p>

<p>But Mygdonia, the wife of Kar&#299;sh,
arose early too (and) went to salute Judas the Apostle. And she found him
sitting and conversing with the general and with a great multitude; and he said
to them: &quot;My children, the woman who yesterday received our Lord into her
heart and soul, whose wife is she?&quot; The general saith to him: &quot;She is
the wife of Kar&#299;sh, the kinsman of king Mazdai, and her husband is a hard
man, and all that he biddeth the king (do), he humoureth him in; and he will
not let her continue as she hath promised, because he telleth many fine stories
about her to the king, and hath said that there is none like to her; and she
too loveth him much, and these things which thou sayest unto them are alien
from them.&quot; Judas saith: &quot;If our Lord hath really risen in her soul,
and she hath received the seed which was sown in her, she will neither make
account of this life, nor be afraid of death j nor will Kar&#299;sh be able any
more to do anything to her, nor to make her suffer, because He whom she hath
received into her soul is greater than he, if she hath received (Him) once for
all with perfect love.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Mygdonia heard these things, she
saith to Judas: &quot;Of a truth, my lord, through thy prayer I have received
the living seed of the Word, and fruits which are like unto the seed I shall
yield in my Lord Jesus.&quot; Judas saith: &quot;These our souls, which are
Thine, praise Thee, our Lord. These our spirits, which are Thy true
possessions, praise Thee, my Lord. These our bodies, which Thou hast made
worthy to be the dwelling-place of Thy Spirit, that is always to be glorified,
praise Thee, my Lord.&quot; And the Apostle said to all those who were there:
&quot;Blessed are the pure, whose souls never upbraid them, because they have
gained them and they are not in doubt regarding themselves. Blessed are the
spirits of the pure, who have won the crown and gone up from the contest to
what is given up unto them. Blessed are the bodies of the pure, which are
worthy to become clean temples in which the Messiah shall dwell. Blessed are
ye, pure, for unto you it is allowed to ask and to receive. Blessed are ye,
pure, for ye are called judges. Blessed are ye, pure, for to you is granted
power to forgive sins. Blessed are ye, pure, for ye have not destroyed what was
delivered unto you, but ye take it up on high with you, rejoicing. Blessed are
ye, meek, for God hath deemed you worthy to inherit the kingdom. Blessed are
ye, meek, for it is ye who have conquered the evil (one). Blessed are ye, meek,
for ye are the children of light. Blessed are ye, meek, for ye shall see the
face of your Lord. Blessed are ye, temperate, for ye shall be contented and
rejoice in those spiritual things which pass not away and are not dissolved,
and the eaters of which hunger not. Blessed are ye, temperate, for ye are
delivered from sin.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the Apostle had said these
things, whilst the whole multitudes were listening to him, Mygdonia, the wife
of Kar&#299;sh, the friend of king Mazdai, was greatly strengthened in purity
and temperance and all meekness. And whilst they were solacing themselves the
whole day with the praises and the majesty of the Lord, Karish, the friend of
king Mazdai, came to dinner, and did not find his wife at home; and he began to
ask all his servants about her, (saying,) &quot; Whither is your mistress
gone?&quot; And one of them said to him: &quot;She is gone to the strange man,
and there she is.&quot; And when he heard these things from his servant, he was
angry with his other servants that they had not informed him of what had
happened. And he went (and) bathed and came back whilst it was still light, and
was sitting and waiting for Mygdonia till she should come.</p>

<p>And when it was evening, she came, and he
met her and said to her: &quot;Where hast thou been till now?&quot; And she
said to him: &quot;I went to the physician's house.&quot; He saith: &quot;That
strange conjuror is the physician.&quot; She saith to him: &quot;Yea, he is the
physician, and he is different from all (other) physicians, for all (other)
physicians heal these bodies which shall be dissolved, but this physician
healeth the bodies with the souls, which shall never more be dissolved.&quot;
And when Kar&#299;sh, the kinsman of king Mazdai, heard these things, he was
angry in his mind with Mygdonia and with the stranger, but he said nothing to
her,—because he was afraid of her, for she was far superior to him in wealth,
and also in her understanding,—but he went, (and) entered into the dining-room,
and sat down to supper; and she went again into her ante-chamber.  And he told
his servants to call her to come out (and) sup with him; but she did not wish
(it).    And when he heard that she did not wish to come out, he went in to her
and said to her: &quot;Why wilt thou not come out to sup with me? And perhaps
too thou dost not wish to sleep with me  according  to  thy wont? Of this I am
sorely afraid, especially as I have heard that that sorcerer and deceiver is
most anxious about this, that a man should not be with his wife; a thing that
nature enjoineth, and with which the gods too are pleased, he taketh away (from
us).&quot;</p>

<p>And when Kar&#299;sh had said these things
to her, Mygdonia was silent, and he said again to her: &quot;My sister and
lady and beloved and wife, Mygdonia, be not led astray by idle and foolish
words nor by deeds of witchcraft, which, I have heard, he does in the name of
his god; for from the day that the world came into being, it hath never been
heard that a man brought the dead to life; but this man, as I hear, maketh as
if he brought the dead to life. And as to his not eating or drinking, do not
suppose that it is for righteousness' sake that he neither eateth nor drinketh,
but because he hath not got anything. For what shall he eat, who hath not even
bread for the day? And that he weareth, (only) one (garment) is because he hath
not another; and that he doth not take pay from any man is because he knows
that he doth not in reality heal any man.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Kar&#299;sh had said these things
to Mygdonia, she was as silent as a stone, and was praying, and asking when it
would be morning, and when she could see the Apostle of God. And he left her
and went (and) supped in sorrowful mood. And when he was thinking that, lo, he
would sleep with her according to his wont,— but she, at the moment when he
went out from her, kneeled down, and was praying and saying: &quot;My Lord, and
my God, and my Life-giver, the Messiah, do Thou give me  strength to overcome the
daring of Karish, and do Thou grant me that I may preserve the purity in which
Thou takest delight, and by which I shall find eternal life;&quot; and when she
had prayed, she covered her face and lay down—Kar&#299;sh, as soon as he had
supped, came and stood over her, and took off  his clothes. And she perceived
him, and saith to him: &quot;There is no place for thee beside me, because my
Lord Jesus, with whom I am united, is better than thou, and He is always
beside  me.&quot;    And Kar&#299;sh laughed and said to her: &quot;Thou mockest
well that sorcerer, and laughest well at him for saying, 'Ye cannot live before
God unless ye be pure.' &quot; And when he had spoken thus, he dared to lie
down beside her, but she did not endure (it), but cried out at him bitterly and
said: &quot; Help, Thou new God, who through a strange man art come to India!
Help, Lord Jesus! Forsake me not, because I take refuge with Thee; for as I
have heard that Thou seekest those who know Thee not, lo, now that I am
seeking. Thee and have heard tell of Thee and have believed in Thee, come to my
help, and deliver me from the insolence of Kar&#299;sh, and let not his
impurity prevail over me, and let him not have a place beside me.&quot; And she
arose, and tied his hands, and fled from beside him, and laid hold of the curtain
which covered the door of the chamber and wrapped herself (therein), and went
out (and) went to her nurse, and slept beside her for that night.</p>

<p>But Kar&#299;sh was in sorrow all that
night, and was beating his hands against one another, and was wishing to go
during the night  (and) inform king Mazdai of the violence that had been done
him. And he was thinking and saying : &quot;If I go in the great distress which
I feel, who will give me admittance to king Mazdai? For I know that, if fate
had not ruined me, and hurled me down from my pride and haughtiness and
greatness into contempt and abasement, and separated my beloved Mygdonia from
me, (even) to king Mazdai, had he been standing at this hour at my door, I
would not have gone out and given an answer. But I will wait till morning; and
I know that, whatever I say to  king Mazdai, he will humour me therein.    And
I will tell him of the sorcery of the stranger, how he useth violence and
casteth down the exalted into an abyss; for I am not grieved at being cut off
from intercourse with Mygdonia, but I am sorry for Mygdonia herself, that her
greatness hath been degraded, and her freedom brought low, and her high spirit
humbled, and that a woman, whom none of her own servants ever saw in any evil
tempers, runneth naked out of her chamber, and perchance she is gone out into
the street through the influence of the sorcery of the stranger;  but I know
not whither she is gone, for  there  was  nothing  to be seen with her.&quot;
And when he had said these things, he began to weep and to say: &quot;Woe is to
me for thy sake, my true wife, of whom I am now deprived! Woe is to me for thy
sake, my beloved and my lover, who wast more to me than my whole kindred! And
neither son nor daughter have I from thee, with whom I might rest contented. A
whole year thou hast not completed with me, and an (evil) eye hath taken thee
from me. Would that the might of death had taken thee by force from me, and I
should (still) have counted myself with kings and princes and nobles,—and not
this strange man, who is perhaps a slave and a fugitive from his owners, and
hath come hither because of my ill luck! I shall never have rest, and never be
stopped, until I destroy him and chastise him and avenge myself upon him.
To-night I will not appear before king Mazdai;  but if he .doth not humour me,
and doth not chastise that stranger, I will tell him about the general Sîfûra
too, that he hath been the cause of destruction to this (woman); for, lo, he
sitteth in his house, and many go in and out unto him, and he teacheth them the
new doctrine of purity, and teacheth and saith that a man cannot live, unless
he separateth himself from all that belongeth to him, and becometh an ascetic
and a wandering mendicant like unto himself, and lo, he wisheth to make
companions for himself.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst Kar&#299;sh was meditating
these things, it became morning. And he rose early (and) dressed and put on his
shoes; but he put on sorry garments, and his countenance was gloomy, and he was
very sad; and he went in to salute king Mazdai. And when king Mazdai saw him,
he said to him: &quot;What is the matter, that thou art come to me in this
wretched plight? And why is thy aspect sad, and thy countenance changed?&quot;
Kar&#299;sh saith to him: &quot;King Mazdai, I have a new fact to tell thee,
and a new calamity, which Sîfûr hath brought to India. A Hebrew, a conjuror, is
sitting in his house, and  never   goeth   out   from   beside   him;   and 
many go in to him, and he teacheth them the new God and giveth them new laws,
which have never been heard of by us; and he saith: 'Ye cannot be children of
this everlasting life, which I teach, unless ye sever yourselves, a man from
his wife, and a woman from her husband.' Now it   chanced  that my wretched 
and miserable wife went to see him, and heard his words and believed them; and
she arose by night and fled from beside me, she who could not bear to be away
from me for a single hour and could not exist without me. But send (and) fetch
Sîfûr and the conjuror who lays snares for him, and chastise them; and if not,
all our countrymen will be destroyed by his words.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Mazdai heard these things from
his kinsman Kar&#299;sh, he said to him: &quot;Be not grieved and vexed. I will
send and fetch him, and chastise him, and thou shalt get back thy wife; for if
I avenge others who cannot avenge themselves, thee, lo, especially (must I
avenge).&quot; And he commanded that they should summon Sîfûr the general (to
come) to him; and they went to his house and found him sitting on the right
hand of Judas, the Apostle of God, and Mygdonia was sitting at his feet, with a
great multitude, and they were listening to him. Those who went after Sîfûr the
general answered and say to him: &quot;Dost thou sit and listen to vain words,
whilst king Mazdai in his wrath is seeking to destroy thee, because of this sorcerer
and seducer, whom thou hast brought into thy house?&quot; And when Sîfûr the
general heard these things, he was grieved, not because the king was angered
with him, but because the king had heard regarding him that he was acquainted
with Judas the Apostle. And Sîfûr said to Judas: &quot;I am grieved on thy
account, for I told thee a day agone that that woman was the wife of
Kar&#299;sh, the kinsman of king Mazdai, and that he would not let her do what
she promised; and whatever he saith to the king, he humoureth him
therein.&quot; Judas saith to Sîfûr: &quot;Be not afraid, but believe in Jesus,
who pleadeth for both me and thee, and for all those who take refuge with Him
and come to His place of assembly.&quot; And when Sîfûr the general heard these
things, he put on his dress and went to king Mazdai.</p>

<p>And Judas was asking Mygdonia, what was
the reason that her husband was angry with her, and meditated these things
against them. She saith to him: &quot;Because I did not give myself to
corruption with him; for in the evening he wished to make me yield, and to
subject me to that which he is wont to do; but He to whom I have committed
myself delivered me from his hands, and I fled naked from beside him, and slept
with my nurse, and I know not what has come to him that he plots these things against
you.&quot; The Apostle saith to her: &quot;These things, my daughter, harm us
not; but believe in Jesus, and He will restrain from thee the lust of
Kar&#299;sh, and He will deliver thee from corruption and wantonness, and He
will be to thee a guide in the path of danger, and a conductor to His and His
Father's kingdom, and He will bring thee into everlasting life, and will give
thee a sovereignty that passeth not away and changeth not.&quot;</p>

<p>And when  Sîfûr stood before king Mazdai,
Mazdai asked him and said to him: &quot;What is his story, and whence is he,
and what doth he teach, the sorcerer who plotteth against thee?&quot; Sîfûr
saith to him:  &quot;Dost thou perchance not know, my lord, that I and all my
friends were in great sorrow about my wife,—whom, as thou knowest, many held in
honour,—and about my daughter, in comparison with whom I counted as nought all
that I possess? And what calamity and what trial came upon them? And how they
became a laughing-stock and an imprecation through the whole country? And I
heard tell of this man, and went to him, and asked of him, and fetched him, and
we came hither; and I saw wonderful miracles whilst I was coming with him on
the road, and here too many saw and heard what the wild ass said, and what the
demon declared concerning him. And he healed my wife and my daughter, and lo,
they are well, and he asked for no reward except belief and purity, that they
might be participators in what he is doing; and he saith, 'Fear one God, the
Lord of all, and Jesus the Messiah, His Son, and ye shall live for ever and
ever'; and he eateth nothing at all but bread and salt from evening to evening,
and drinketh water; and he prayeth much, and whatever he asketh of God, He
giveth him; and he enjoineth (us) too, (saying) that this his God is holy and
good and benign and gentle and a giver of life, and (that) therefore those who
believe in Him draw nigh unto Him in cleanness and purity and love.&quot;</p>

<p>And when king Mazdai heard these things
from Sîfûr, he sent a number of soldiers from his presence to the house of Sîfûr
the general} to fetch Judas Thomas and those whom they found with him. And when
they went in, they found him sitting and teaching a great many people, and
Mygdonia too was sitting at his feet. And they were afraid, when they saw the
great number of people that surrounded him; and they went to tell king Mazdai,
(saying): &quot;We did not dare to say aught to him, because a great many
people were with him, and Mygdonia too was sitting at his feet and hearing his
words.&quot; And when Mazdai and Kar&#299;sh heard these things, Kar&#299;sh
sprang up from before king Mazdai, and took with him a number of soldiers, and
said : &quot; I will go and fetch him and also Mygdonia, whose senses he hath
taken away.&quot; And he came to the house of Sîfûr the general in haste, and came
and found Judas sitting and teaching. And when he went in, he saw Judas, but he
did not find Mygdonia there, for she had gone home, because she knew that they
would tell her husband about her that she was there. And Kar&#299;sh said to
Judas: &quot;Get up, wretch and corrupter and enemy! But what can thy
witchcraft do to me? For I will make thy sorceries recoil upon thy own
head.&quot; And when he had spoken thus to him, Judas looked upon him and said
to him: &quot;Thy threats shall recoil upon thee, for me thou canst not hurt at
all, because my Lord Jesus the Messiah, with whom I take refuge, is greater
than thou and thy king and all thy forces.&quot; And Kar&#299;sh took the
turban of one of his servants, and threw it round the Apostle's neck, and said:
&quot;Drag him off; let me see if Jesus will deliver him from my hands.&quot;
And they were dragging him away until (they came) to king Mazdai.</p>

<p>And when Judas stood before king Mazdai,
he said to him: &quot;Tell me what is thy story, by whose power thou doest
these works?&quot;    And Judas was silent
and gave him no reply. And king Mazdai commanded the soldiers, and they struck
him a hundred and fifty lashes ;a and he gave orders that they should convey
him bound to prison; and they bound him and carried him off.   And when he was
gone and had entered into the prison, Mazdai and Kar&#299;sh were planning how
they might kill him, because the whole people were worshipping him as God, and
they took pains to say (everywhere), &quot;He hath reviled the king, and he is
a conjuror&quot;</p>

<p>But Judas, when he went to prison, was
glad and rejoicing,&nbsp; saying: &quot;I  thank  thee, my Lord  Jesus  the
Messiah, that Thou hast deemed me worthy not only to believe in Thee, but also
to bear many things for Thy sake.&quot; And he said: &quot;I thank Thee, my
Lord, that Thou hast deemed me worthy of these things. I thank Thee, my Lord,
that Thy providence hath been over me, and that Thou hast deemed me worthy to
bear many evils for Thy sake. I thank thee, my Lord, that for Thy sake, I have
been a recluse and an ascetic and a pauper and a wandering mendicant. Let me then
receive of the blessing of the poor, and of the rest of the weary, and of the
blessing of those whom men hate and persecute and revile and say of them 
odious words. Lo, for Thy sake I am hated and shunned by many; for Thy sake
they say of me I know not what.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst he was praying, all those who
were in the prison saw that he was praying and begged of him to pray for them
too. And when he had prayed and sat down, Judas began to chant this hymn.</p>

<p align=center>The Hymn of Judas Thomas the
Apostle in the country of the Indians. </p>

<p>&quot;WHEN I was a little child, and
dwelling in my kingdom, in my father's house, and was content with the wealth
and the luxuries of my nourishers, from the East our home my parents equipped
me (and) sent me forth; and of the wealth of our treasury they took abundantly,
(and) tied up for me a load large and (yet) light, which I myself could
carry—gold of Beth-&#8219;Ell&#257;y&#275;, and silver of Gazak the great, and
rubies of India, and agates from Beth-K&#257;sh&#257;n; and they furnished me
with the adamant, which can crush iron. And they took off from me the
glittering robe, which  in their affection they had made for me, and the purple
toga, which was measured (and) woven to my stature. And they made a compact
with me, and wrote it in my heart, that it might not be forgotten: 'If  thou
goest down  into Egypt, and bringest the one pearl, which is in the midst of
the sea around the loud-breathing serpent, thou shalt put on thy glittering
robe and thy toga, with which (thou art) contented, and with thy brother, who
is next to us in authority, thou shalt be heir in our kingdom.' I quitted the
East (and) went down, there being with me two guardians, for the way was
dangerous and difficult, and I was very young to travel it. I passed through
the borders of Maishan, the meeting-place of the merchants of the East, and I
reached the land of Babel, and I entered the walls of Sarbug. I went down into
Egypt, and my companions parted from me. I went straight to the serpent, I
dwelt around his abode, (waiting)&nbsp; till  he should slumber and  sleep, and I
could take my pearl from him. And when I was single and was alone (and) become
strange to my family, one of my race, a free-born man, an Oriental, I saw
there, a youth fair and loveable, the son of oil-sellers; and he came and attached
himself to me, and I made him my intimate friend, an associate with whom I
shared my merchandise.    I warned him against the Egyptians, and against 
consorting with  the  unclean; and I dressed in their dress, that they might
not hold me in abhorrence, because I was come from abroad in order to take the
pearl, and arouse the serpent against me.   But in some way or  other  they
found out that I was not their countryman, and they dealt with me
treacherously, and gave me their food to eat. I forgot that I was a son of
kings, and I served their king; and I forgot the pearl, for which my parents
had sent me, and because of the burden of their oppressions I lay in a deep
sleep. But all these things that befell me my parents perceived, and were
grieved for me; and a proclamation was  made in our kingdom, that every one
should come to our gate <i>(i.e., </i>palace or residence), kings and princes
of Parthia, and all the nobles of the East. And they wove a plan on my behalf,
that I might not be left in Egypt; and they wrote to me a letter, and every
noble signed his name to it:'From thy father, the king of kings, and
thy mother, the mistress of the East, and from thy brother, our second (in
authority), to thee our son, who art in Egypt, greeting! Up and arise from thy
sleep, and listen to the words of our letter! Call to mind that thou art a son
of kings! See the slavery,—whom thou servest! Remember the pearl, for which
thou wast sent to Egypt! Think of thy robe, and remember thy splendid toga,
which thou shalt wear and (with which) thou shalt be adorned, when thy name
hath been read out in the list of the valiant, and with thy brother, our
viceroy, thou shalt be in our kingdom.' My letter is a letter, which the king
sealed with his own right hand, (to keep it) from the wicked ones, the children
of Babel, and from the savage-demons of Sarbug. It flew in the likeness of an
eagle, the king of all birds; it flew and alighted beside me, and became all
speech. At its voice and the sound of its rustling, I started and arose from my
sleep. I took it up and kissed it, and I began (and), read it; and according to
what was traced on my heart were the words of my letter written, I remembered
that I was a son of royal parents, and my noble birth asserted its nature. I
remembered the pearl, for which I had been sent to Egypt, and I began to charm
him, the terrible loud-breathing serpent. I hushed him to sleep and lulled him
into slumber, for my father's name I named over him, and the name of our second
(in power), and of my mother, the queen of the East; and I snatched away the
pearl, and turned to go back to my father's house. And their filthy and unclean
dress I stripped off, and left it in their country; and I took my way straight
to come to the light of our home the East. And my letter, my awakener, I found
before me on the road; and as with its voice it had awakened me, (so) too with
its light it was leading me. It, that dwelt in the palace, gave light before me
with its form, and with its voice and its guidance it also encouraged me to
speed, and with its love it drew me on. I went forth (and) passed by Sarbug; I
left Babel on my left hand; and I came to the great Maish&#257;n, to the haven
of merchants, which sitteth on the shore of the sea. And my bright robe, which
I had stripped off, and the toga that was wrapped with it, from
R&#257;mth&#257; and Reken (?) my parents had sent thither by the hand of their
treasurers, who in their truth could be trusted therewith. And because I
remembered not its fashion,—for in my childhood I had left it, in my father's
house,—on a sudden, when I (received) it. the garment seemed to me to become
like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in all, and I too received all in it, for
we were two in distinction and yet again one in one likeness. And the
treasurers too, who brought it to me, I saw in like manner to be two (and yet)
one likeness, for one sign of the king was written on them (both), of the hands
of him who restored to me through them my trust and my wealth, my decorated
robe, which was adorned with glorious colours, with gold and beryls and rubies
and  agates and sardonyxes, varied in colour. And it was skilfully worked in
its home on high, and with diamond clasps were all its seams fastened; and the
image of the king of kings was embroidered and depicted in full all over it;
and like the stone of the sapphire too its hues were varied.    And I saw also 
that all  over it the instincts  of knowledge were working, and I saw too that
it was preparing to  speak.    I heard the sound of its tones, which it uttered
with its ..... , (saying):  'I am the active in deeds, whom they reared for him
before my father; and I perceived myself, that my stature grew according to his
labours.' And in its kingly movements it poured itself entirely over me, and
on the hand of its givers it hastened that I might take it. And love urged me
too to run to meet it and receive it; and I stretched forth and took it. With
the beauty of its colours I adorned myself, and I wrapped myself wholly in my
toga of brilliant hues. I clothed myself with it, and went up to the gate of
salutation and prostration; I bowed my head and worshipped the majesty of my
father who sent me,—for I had done his commandments, and he too had done what
he promised,—and at the gate of his retainers I mingled with his princes, for
he rejoiced in me and received me, and I was with him in his kingdom, and with
the voice of ..... all his servants praise him. And he promised that to the
gate too of the king of kings with him I should go, and with my offering and my
pearl with him should present myself to our king.&quot;</p>

and in grace, through His death by crucifixion.</p>

sins with the sign of Thy wounds and with the sprinkling of Thy blood upon us.</p>

<p>&quot;To be glorified art Thou,  the  good
Father, who dwellest in the pure heart, in the mind of Thy worshippers, and
art hidden from all in Thy aspect, and revealed to us in Thy Messiah.</p>

<p>&quot;To be praised art Thou, the Son, the
Word, proclaiming Thy coming in stillness, who didst put on our humanity and
deliver us by Thy living and innocent blood.</p>

<p>&quot;To be glorified art Thou, the living
Father, who didst give (new) life to our deadness, for we had erred from Thy
way and were dead and perished, but Thy mercy was upon us.</p>

<p>&quot;To be praised art Thou, the beloved
Son, who didst give (new) life to our deadness, and didst turn back our I going

Messiah, and whom we have tasted through Thy Fruit and have become children of
Thy peace.</p>

<p>&quot;To be glorified art Thou, the Father

Voice conceived of knowledge, our holy Priest, who hast made atonement for us
by Thy pure and holy offering, and hast poured out Thy living blood on behalf
of sinners.</p>

<p>&quot;To be glorified art Thou, the Father
exalted, who art hidden from all worlds, and art revealed according to Thy will
to all Thy worshippers.</p>

signed us with Thy living and life-giving Cross.</p>

<p>&quot;All mouths and all tongues glorify
the Father and worship the Son and praise Thy holy Spirit, the worlds and the
creatures which are hidden and which are manifest.</p>

<p>&quot;Thy Angels glorify Thee on high
through Thy Messiah, who became in Sheol peace and hope to the dead, who came
to life and were raised.</p>

<p>&quot;We beg of Thee, our Lord and our
Life-giver, (the accomplishment) of all that Thou hast said and promised.
Fulfil with us Thy grace, and raise us up to the place of Thy peace; for Thou
art our Life-giver, Thou art our Paraclete, Thou art the medicine of our life,
Thou art our sign of victory.</p>

<p>&quot;Blessed are we, Lord, who have known
Thee. Blessed are we, who have believed in Thee. Blessed are we through Thy
wounds and Thy blood, (suffered and shed) on our behalf. Blessed are we, for
Thou art our great hope.    Blessed are we, for Thou art our God, and for ever
and ever, Amen.&quot; </p>

<p>And Kar&#299;sh, the husband of Mygdonia,
went to his house, rejoicing greatly, because he thought in his mind that
henceforth his wife would be with him as formerly, before she heard the word of
Judas and believed in our Lord Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.    And when
Kar&#299;sh went, he found his wife sitting, and her looks were downcast,&quot;
and her clothes rent, and she was like a mad woman, because of Judas. He saith
to her: &quot;My lady and sister Mygdonia, what is this wicked folly that hath
taken possession of thee? And why hast thou done these things? I am Kar&#299;sh,
the husband of thy youth, and I am he who from the gods and by the law hath
power over thee.  Why hast thou now acted like a mad woman? And why art thou
become a laughing-stock through this whole country? But from, this moment
dismiss
the thought of that wizard from thy mind, for I am about to take away the sight
of him from before thine eyes, that thou mayest see him no more.&quot; And when
she had heard these things from Kar&#299;sh her husband, she was  again  sorely
grieved and afflicted. And he said again to her: &quot;What crime, pr'ythee,
hast thou committed against
the gods, that they have let thee come to this great misery? And what sin hast
thou wrought before them that they have brought thee to this degradation and
ridicule? I beg of thee, Mygdonia, torture not my soul by the sight of thee,
and pain not my heart by thy care. I am Kar&#299;sh, the husband of thy youth,
and I am thy true husband, whom the whole country honoureth and whom they fear.
What I shall do henceforth, I know not, nor how I shall conduct myself, nor
what plan I shall devise.   Shall I remember in my heart thy beauty, and be
silent? Or shall I think of thy chaste conduct, and say nothing? Who is there,
from whom they (try to) take away a goodly and fair treasure, and he letteth go
his hold of it?    Am I able to bear (the loss of) thy winsome  beauties, which
are with me at all times? Thy  sweet fragrance, lo, is in my nostrils; and thy
fair colour, lo, is before my eyes; my soul, which they (are  trying  to) take 
away from me; my bright eye, with which I saw, and which they are plucking out
and taking away from me; my fair body, of which I was proud, and which they are
ill-using and taking away from me; my right arm, which they are cutting off
from me; my beauty, which is destroyed; my comfort, through which they are
distressing me; my joy, which is turned into sorrow; my rest, which is become
an affliction to me; my life, which is changed into death; my light, which is
dyed with darkness. The members of my great house shall not see me (again), for
in this affliction I have had no help (from them). My noble friends shall not
see me (again), who have not saved me from this affliction. I will no longer
worship the gods of the East, who have brought me to these miseries, nor will I
pray before them, nor sacrifice to them again, nor offer to them an offering,
because I am deprived of this my true union. For what (prayer) should I again
pray to them? Or what should I beg of them, or ask of them to give me, who have
deprived me of that which was dearer to me than everything which I possessed
in the world, and with which I was contented? For I have more wealth than I can
use, and possessions, the amount of which I cannot reckon. A prince too I have 
been  made, and I have  been named the king's f deputy;  and many fear me, and
many are under myhand.    Would that some one would take away from me
all these glories and my great wealth, and give me one hour of thy past years,
Mygdonia! Would that some one would blind one of my eyes, and that thy eyes
would look upon me as they were wont! Would that some one would cut off my
right arm, and that I might embrace thee with my left arm!&quot;</p>

<p>Whilst Kar&#299;sh was saying these things and weeping, Mygdonia
was sitting like one stone-deaf, and looked not at him, but upon the ground,
and was silent. And he came near to her again, and said to her: &quot;My
daughter and my beloved, Mygdonia, remember that thou didst please me above all
the women of India, and that I chose thee when I might have taken many who were
of higher rank than thou.    But indeed I lie not, Mygdonia; no by God, there
is not for me another (woman) in all India like to thee. &quot;What beauty, and
what ornament, and what elegance, and what noble qualities am I losing!
&quot;Woe to me and to the world, for I shall never hear thee speak again!   
Although he hath reviled (me), I beg of thee, lift up thine eyes and look upon
me, for I am far better than that wizard, and am handsomer than he, and I have
wealth and honour, and every one knoweth that no one hath a lineage like to
mine. And thou art more to me than my kindred and than all that I have; and lo,
they are taking thee away from me!&quot;</p>

<p>And when Kar&#299;sh had said these things, Mygdonia saith to him:
&quot;Kar&#299;sh, He whom I love is more than all that thou possessest and all
that thou hast; for all that thou hast is of the earth and remaineth on the
earth; but He whom I love is in Heaven, and He will take me up to Heaven unto
Himself. For thy wealth passeth away, and thy beauty becomes marred, and thy
robes become old and decay and  perish, and thou (art left) alone with thy
trespasses and thy sins. If thou art not delivered from them, they will cleave
unto thee.    Remind me not of thy former doings with me, which I pray and beg
of my Lord to blot out for me. Remind me not of thy filthy and unclean
pleasures and thy fleshly deeds, from which I pray that I may be rescued by the
love of my Lord. I have forgotten all thy practices, and thy familiarities and
thy doings are at an end with thyself; but my Lord and my Saviour, Jesus,
abideth alone for ever,  with those souls which have taken refuge with Him. He
with whom I have taken refuge, and in whom I have believed, will save me and
deliver me from all thy deeds of shame, which I used to do with thee, when I
did not believe.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Kar&#299;sh heard these things, he went and lay down to
sleep, being grieved. And he said to her: &quot;Reflect and consider (this) in
thy mind to-day, the whole night. If thou wilt be with me as thou wast, before
thou sawest this wizard, I will humour thee in all that thou wishest. And if
thou wishest, because of the love that thou hast had for him, I will lead him
forth (and) convey him away, and he shall go to another country, and I will not
cause thee any distress, for I know that thou cleavest unto him. And this did
not begin with thee, but the like of this thing hath befallen many women;  but
at last they have bethought themselves, and discerned what hath befallen them,
and come to themselves, and have been saved from insult and mockery. Let not,
then, these things, which I have said unto thee, seem to thee as nothing, and
let them not pass away as external (<i>or</i> foreign) to thee; and make me not
a mockery and a laughing-stock and a proverb in India.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had said these things to her, he went (and) slept. But
Mygdonia took twenty <i>z&#363;z&#275;, </i>and went, without any one
perceiving her, to the prison, to give it to the keepers of the prisoners, that
they might let her in to Judas. And as she was going, Judas met her coming to
her; and she saw him and was afraid, for she thought that it was one of the
nobles, because of the great light which was coming before him; and she said:
&quot;Woe to thee, feeble soul that art perishing! I shall never again see
Judas, the Apostle of Jesus, the living God, because I have not yet received
the sign (of baptism from him.&quot; And she fled, and went into another
street, and saith: &quot;It is better for me that others, (who are) poor,
should take me, for I can persuade them (to let me go), and that this great
man should not take me, who will not accept a bribe from me.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst Mygdonia was meditating these things, Judas came and
entered in behind her. And she was afraid, and fell down from terror; and he
stood over her, and said to her: &quot;Be not afraid, Mygdonia; Jesus the
Messiah will not forsake thee, and thy Lord will not forsake thee, to whom thou
hast committed thy soul; the Gracious will not forsake thee, whose mercy is
great; the Benignant will not forsake thee for His kindness' sake; the Good
will not forsake thee for His goodness' sake; the Great will not forsake thee
for His greatness' sake. Rise from the ground, above which thou once wast
(raised).  Look upon the light of thy Lord, for He will not let those that love
Him walk in darkness. Behold the Companion of His servants, to whom He is a
light in darkness. Behold the Help of His servants, to whom He is a helper in
afflictions.&quot;</p>

<p>And Mygdonia arose, and was looking at him and saying to him:
&quot;Whither wast thou going, my lord? And who let thee out of prison  to see
the sun?&quot; Judas saith to her: &quot;Our Lord Jesus the Messiah is stronger
than all powers and kings and rulers; He opened the doors and lulled the
keepers to sleep.&quot; Mygdonia saith to him: &quot;Give me the sign of Jesus
the Messiah, and let me receive His gift from thy hands, before thou departest
from the world.&quot; And she took him, and went and entered into her house,
and awakened her nurse, and saith to her: &quot;My mother and nurse Narkia, all
thy deeds of help unto me, and thy kindnesses from my childhood until now,
thou hast done unto me in vain, and my fleeting favour I bestow upon thee for
them; but do me this favour which (lasts) for ever, and thou shalt be rewarded
by Him who gives everything unto His, and fortune cannot deprive them
(thereof).&quot; Narkia says to her: &quot;What wantest thou, my daughter
Mygdonia? And what comfort canst thou have? For all the former honours, (which)
thou didst promise to do unto me, the strange man doth not let thee (do), and
thou hast made me a reproach in this country. Now, pr'ythee, what dost thou
want to do anew unto me?&quot; She saith to her: &quot;Be with me a sharer in
the everlasting life, and let me receive from thee the perfect education. Fetch
secretly for me a loaf of bread, and bring out for me a mingled draught of
wine, and have pity upon me a freeborn woman.&quot; Narkia saith to her:
&quot;I will fetch thee bread in plenty and many flagons of wine, and I will do
thy pleasure (for thee).&quot; Mygdonia saith to her nurse Narkia: &quot;Many
flagons are of no use to me, but a mingled draught in a cup, and one whole
loaf, and a little oil, even if (it be) in a lamp, bring unto me.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Narkia had brought (them), Mygdonia uncovered her head,
and was standing before the holy Apostle. And he took the oil, and cast (it) on
her head, and said: &quot;Holy oil, which wast given to us for unction, and
hidden mystery of the Cross, which is seen through it—Thou, the straightener of
crooked limbs, Thou, our Lord Jesus, life and health and remission of sins,—let
Thy power come and abide upon this oil, and let Thy holiness dwell in it.&quot;
And he cast (it) upon the head of Mygdonia, and said: &quot;Heal her of her
old wounds, and wash away from her her sores, and strengthen her
weakness.&quot; And when he had cast the oil on her head, he told her nurse to
anoint her, and to put a cloth round her loins; and he fetched the basin of
their conduit. And Judas went up (and) stood over it, and baptized Mygdonia in
the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit of holiness. And when she had
come out and put on her clothes, he fetched and brake the Eucharist and
(filled) the cup, and let Mygdonia partake of the table of the Messiah and of
the cup of the Son of God. And he said to her: &quot;Now then thou hast
received the sign, and gained to thyself thy life for ever and ever.&quot; And
a voice was heard from Heaven, which said, a Yea, Amen and Amen.&quot; And when
Narkia heard this voice, she was amazed, and she too begged of the Apostle that
she also might receive the sign; and he gave (it) to her and said: &quot;May
the grace of Jesus be with thee as with the rest of thy companions.&quot; And
he went to be shut up in prison, and found the doors open and the watchmen
asleep.</p>

<p>And Judas said: &quot;Who is like unto Thee, O God, who dost not
withhold Thy love and mercy from man? Who is like unto Thee in mercy and grace,
save Thy Father, who hath delivered His universe from misery and error? Love
that hath conquered desire; truth that hath destroyed falsehood; Thou fair
(One) in whom nothing odious is seen; Thou humble (One), who hast cast down
pride; Thou living (One), who hast destroyed death; Thou tranquil (One), who
hast put an end to toil;—glory to the Only (-begotten), who (is) of the Father!
Glory to the mercy which was sent by mercy! Glory to Thy mercy which is upon
us!&quot; And when he had said these things, the watchmen awoke, and found all
the doors open, but the prisoners asleep; and they said: &quot;We forgot these
doors and did not close them; had this been (done) by an adversary, not a man
would have remained here.&quot;</p>

<p>And Kar&#299;sh went early in the morning to Mygdonia and to her
nurse, and found her and her nurse praying and saying: &quot;NewGod,
who hast come hither through a strange man; holy God, who art hidden from the
whole race of the Indians; God, who hast shown us Thy glory through Thy Apostle
Thomas; God, of whom we have heard tell and have believed in Thee; God, to
whom, because we perceived that there was life in Thee, we have run that Thou
mightest give us life; God, who, because of Thy mercy and Thy grace, didst
reach down to our littleness; God; who sought us when we did not know Thee;
God, who sittest on high, and nothing that is in the depth is concealed from
Thee;—do Thou, Lord, keep off from us the hot anger of Kar&#299;sh; do Thou
stop his lying mouth; and do Thou cast him beneath the feet of Thy
believers.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Kar&#299;sh heard these things, he saith to Mygdonia:
&quot;Well hast thou called me evil and hot and odious and bitter, for had I
not humoured thee; this wretchedness and bitterness would not have come about
me, and thou wouldst not be invoking against me the witchcraft of that (man).
But what thought hast thou then conceived, Mygdonia? And what dost thou wish me
to do for thee? Believe me, Mygdonia, there is no good in that wizard, and he
cannot do anything that he promiseth to any one. But I will show thee before
thy eyes all that I say unto thee, if thou wilt be persuaded by me and listen
to my words, and be with me as thou wast with me.&quot; And he drew near again
to her, and was begging of her and saying to her: &quot;I shall feel no
distress, if thou wilt be persuaded by me. Remember, my sister, thy
wedding-day, and the first day on which thou didst accept me (as thy husband),
and tell me now in truth, who is dearer to thee, I at that time or Jesus at
this time.&quot; Mygdonia saith to him: &quot;Kar&#299;sh, that time required
its due, and is gone, and this time requireth its due. That was the time of the
beginning; this is the time of the end. That was the time of the temporal life,
which passeth away; this is the time of the life everlasting. That was the time
of transitory joy; this is the time of the eternal joy, which passeth not away.
That was the time of day and night; this is the time of day without night. That
marriage-feast thou seest, how it has passed away and is gone; but this marriage-feast
shall never pass away.    That was a marriage-feast of corruption; this is a
marriage-feast of life everlasting. Those were groomsmen and bridesmaids who
pass away; these are groomsmen and bridesmaids who abide for ever.    That
(union) was founded upon the earth, where there is an unceasing press; this is
founded upon the bridge of fire, upon which is sprinkled grace. That was a
bridal-chamber which was taken  down; this is a bridal-chamber which remaineth
for ever. That was a bed which was covered with goodly clothes that decay; this
is a bed which is covered with love and faith and truth. Thou art a bridegroom
who passeth away and is changed; Jesus is the true bridegroom who endureth for
ever, and never dieth, and is never subject to corruption. That marriage-gift
was money and clothes, which decay and pass away; this marriage-gift is living
words, which never pass away.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Kar&#299;sh had heard these things, he went (and) told
them to king Mazdai. And king Mazdai said: &quot;Let us fetch (and) destroy
him.&quot; Kar&#299;sh his friend saith to him: &quot;Have patience with him a
little, and bring him out (of prison), and speak to him, and frighten him;
perhaps he will go and persuade Mygdonia to be with me as she was.&quot;</p>

<p>And king Mazdai sent and fetched Judas Thomas, the Apostle of the
Most High. And all the prisoners were grieved because Judas the Apostle had
departed from them, and were looking for him and saying: &quot;The pleasure
which we had they have taken away from us.&quot; And king Mazdai said to Judas:
&quot;Why teachest thou a doctrine which gods and men abhor, and in which there
is nothing pleasing?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;What do I teach that is
bad?&quot; Mazdai saith to him: &quot;What thou sayest, that men cannot live
unto God, unless they keep themselves purely to the God whom thou
preachest.&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;Verily thus I say, and I lie not in
what I say. Pr'ythee, can thy servants stand before thee in mean garb, or when
soiled or dirty? Thou, therefore, who art an earthly king, and perishest with
the earth, requirest of thy servants things fair and clean; as to my King, how
sayest thou that I speak ill (in saying) that His servants should serve Him
with holiness and purity and temperance, and should be without care and without
concern, and should be free from the heavy burden of sons and daughters, and
from the great care of wealth, and from the trouble and empty pride of riches? 
For thou hast willed that those who serve thee and obey thee should conduct
themselves as thou dost; and if one of them transgresseth one of thy
commandments, he receiveth chastisement from thee. How much more does it behove
us, who believe in the name of this God of mine, to serve Him in purity and in
holiness and in temperance and in chastity and in modesty, and that all these
fleshly (lusts) should be strange to us, adultery and theft and drunkenness 
and  lavishness   and the service of the belly and deeds of shame and odious
actions?&quot;    And when king Mazdai had heard these things, he said to
Judas: &quot;Lo, I let thee loose; go (and) persuade Mygdonia, the wife of Kar&#299;sh,
not to part from him.&quot; Judas saith to him : &quot;If thou wishest to do
aught unto me, delay not; for, if she hath really received what she hath heard,
neither iron nor fire, nor anything else that is worse than these, will do aught
unto her or sever Him who hath taken possession of her soul.&quot; King Mazdai
saith to Judas: &quot;I  have heard that wizards can dissolve charms, and that
the sting of a viper can be healed by an antidote, which is got from another
creature that is worse than the viper. Now therefore, if thou choosest, thou
art able to dissolve these former charms of thine, and to make peace and
concord between the husband and his wife; and (in so doing) thou wilt have pity
upon thyself, for thou art not yet sated of thy life. And know that, if thou
dost not persuade her, I will destroy thee out of this life, which is dear to
all men.&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;This life is but a loan, and this time
passeth away and is changed; but the life which I teach never passeth away and
is never changed. This beauty and youth, which is now apparent (in me), will
not be mine after a little.&quot; King Mazdai saith to him: &quot;I advised
thee what was for thy advantage, but thou knowest better than I.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Judas Thomas had gone out from before king Mazdai, Kar&#299;sh
came to him and said to him: &quot;I ask of thee—I have never done any wrong to
thee, nor to any (other) man, nor to the gods—why hast thou brought this
calamity upon me? And why hast thou brought this desolation into my house? And
what profit accrueth to thee from this? Bid me, and I will supply it to thee
without labour.    And why dost thou do mischief to me, when thou canst not
escape from my hands? For know that, if thou dost not persuade her (to return
to me), I will destroy thee, and her too I will destroy out of this life, and
finally I will destroy myself out of the world. And if, as thou sayest, there
be life and death, and condemnation and acquittal, and judgement and recompense,
there I will stand with thee in judgement; and if thy God, who teacheth thee,
be just, and taketh vengeance justly, I shall be recompensed, as I have done
thee no wrong, but thou hast afflicted me, and I have not sinned against thee,
but thou hast sinned against me. But even here I can take revenge upon thee, and
do unto thee all that thou hast done unto me. Hearken to me therefore, and come
with me to my house, and speak to Mygdonia, and persuade her to be with me as
she was before she saw thy face.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas went with him laughing, and said to him: &quot;If men
loved God as they love their fellows, all that they asked of Him He would give
them, and there would be nothing which would not obey them.&quot; And when he
had said these things, Judas entered into the house of Kar&#299;sh, and found
Mygdonia sitting, and Narkia standing before her; and her hands were placed on
her cheeks, and she was  saying to her nurse: &quot;Would  that  the days
passed swiftly over me,  my mother, and that all the hours were one, that I
might go forth from this world, and go (and) see that Beautiful (One), of whom
I have heard tell, that Living (One) and Giver of life to those who believe in
Him, where there is neither night nor day, and no darkness but light, and
neither good nor bad, nor rich nor poor, nor male nor female, nor slaves nor
freemen, nor any who are proud and uplifted over those who are humble.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst she was saying these things, Judas came in; and she
sprang upright (and) prostrated herself to him. Kar&#299;sh saith to him:
&quot;See, she feareth thee and loveth thee, and whatever thou sayest to her,
she will gratify thee (therein).&quot; Judas saith to her: &quot;My daughter
Mygdonia, consent unto what thy brother saith unto thee.&quot; Mygdonia saith
to him:</p>

<p>&quot;Thou art unable to name the deed, and how canst thou
persuade me to do it?  For I have heard thee say: 'This temporal life is (but)
a loan, and this rest is (but) temporary, and these possessions abide not.' And
again thou didst say: 'Whosoever hateth this life, shall go (and) receive life
everlasting; and whosoever hateth this light of day and night, shall go (and)
receive the light in which there is no night.'    And again thou didst say:
'Whosoever forsaketh these earthly possessions, shall go (and) find
possessions that abide for ever;' and other things (similar to these). Because
thou art afraid, thou sayest these things to me (now). Who is there that doth a
thing and exulteth in it, and turneth round (and) renounceth it? And who is
there that buildeth a tower, and overturneth (and) rooteth it up from its
foundations? And who is there that diggeth a well in a parched place, and
throweth in stones and filleth it up? And who is there that findeth a goodly
treasure, and doth not make use of it?&quot;  And when Kar&#299;sh, the kinsman
of king Mazdai, heard these things, he said: &quot;I am not like to you, and I
will not be in haste to destroy you; but thee I will bind, because I have power
over thee, and I will not let thee go to this wizard and converse with him. And
if thou yieldest, (good and well); and if not, I know what I will do.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas went out from the house of Kar&#299;sh, and went to the
house of Sîfûr the
general, and was dwelling there. And Sîfûr said to Judas, &quot; Prepare for thyself an apartment,
and be teaching in it;&quot; and he did as he said to him. And Sîfûr the general
said to him: &quot;I and my daughter and my wife will henceforth live purely,
in one mind and in one love; and we beg that we may receive the sign (of
baptism) from thy hands, and may become true servants unto our Lord, and may be
reckoned among the number of His flock and His sheep.&quot; Judas saith:
&quot;I am meditating what to say, and am afraid; and I know what I know, (but)
I am not able to utter it.&quot;</p>

<p>And he began to speak of baptism, and said: &quot;This is the
baptism of the remission of sins; this is the bringer forth of new men; this is
the restorer of understandings, and the mingler of soul and body, and the
establisher of the new man in the Trinity, and which becometh a participation
in the remission of sins. Glory to thee, (thou) hidden power of baptism! Glory
to thee, (thou) hidden  power, that dost communicate with us in baptism! Glory
to thee, (thou) power that art visible in baptism! Glory to you, (ye) new
creatures, who are renewed through baptism, who draw nigh to it in love!&quot;
And when he had said these things, he cast oil upon their heads and said:
&quot;Glory to thee, (thou) beloved Fruit! Glory to thee, (thou) name of the
Messiah! Glory to thee, (thou) hidden power that dwellest in the Messiah!&quot;
And he spake, and they brought a large vat, and he baptized them in the name of
the Father and the Son and the Spirit of holiness.</p>

<p>And when they were baptized and had put on their clothes, he
brought bread and wine, and placed it on the table, and began to bless it, and
said: &quot;Living bread, the eaters of which die not! Bread, that fillest
hungry souls with thy blessing! Thou that art worthy to receive the gift and to
be for the remission of sins, that those who eat thee may not die! We name the
name of the Father over thee; we name the name of the Son over thee; we name
the name of the Spirit over thee, the exalted name that is hidden from
all.&quot; And he said:   &quot;In Thy name, Jesus, may the power of the
blessing and the thanksgiving come and abide upon this bread, that all the
souls, which take of it, may be renewed, and their sins may be forgiven them.&quot;
And he brake and gave to Sîfûr and to his wife and to his daughter.</p>

<p>And king Mazdai, when he had dismissed Judas Thomas, went to his
house to sup. And he was telling his wife what had happened to his kinsman Kar&#299;sh,
and said to her: &quot;See, my sister, what hath befallen that afflicted (man).
Thou knowest, my sister Tertia, that a man hath no one like his wife, on whom
he relieth. Nowit happened that Mygdonia went to see the sorcerer of
whom she had heard tell and of what he was doing, and he bewitched her, and hath
parted her from her husband, I know not (how); and he knoweth not what to do.
And I wished to destroy him, but he would not let me. But do thou go, and
advise her to hearken to her husband, and do not thou listen to the vain words
of that (man).&quot;</p>

<p>And in the morning Tertia arose and went to the house of Kar&#299;sh,  
her husband's kinsman, and found Mygdonia sitting on the ground, with sackcloth
on and ashes cast upon her, and begging of her Lord that He would forgive her
her former sins, and that she might be delivered from the world speedily. And
when Tertia came in to her, she saith to Mygdonia: &quot;My sister, and my
beloved and close friend, what is this folly that hath taken possession of
thee? And why art thou become like to a mad woman? Be mindful of thyself, be
mindful of thy family; and bestow a thought on thy numerous kindred, and have
pity on thy true husband Kar&#299;sh, and do not anything which doth not befit
thy free birth.&quot;</p>

<p>Mygdonia saith to Tertia: &quot;Thou hast not heard the tidings of
the new life, and hast not tasted the words of the preacher of life, and art
not freed from the troubles of corruption. Thou hast not seen the everlasting
life, and lo, thou standest in the temporal life. Thou hast not become sensible
of the true wedlock, and thou art afflicted by the wedlock of corruption. Thou
art clothed with garments that decay, and thou dost not long for the garments
of eternity. Thou art proud of this beauty of thine which is corruptible, and
thou carest not about the loathsomeness of thy soul. Lo, thou are proud of a
number of slaves, and thine own soul from slavery thou hast not set free. Thou
art proud of the pomp of many (attendants), and thou art not delivered from the
judgement of death.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Tertia had heard these things from Mygdonia, she went in
haste to the house of Sîfûr the general, that she might see the new Apostle who had
come thither. And when she came in to him, he began to say to her: &quot;What
art thou come to see? A wanderer, despised and wretched above all men, without
possessions or wealth? But he hath a possession which kings and princes cannot
take away from him, and which is incorruptible and cannot be plundered, — Jesus
the Messiah, the Life-giver of all mankind, the Son of the Living God, who
giveth life unto all those who believe and come to His refuge, and become of
the number of His sheep.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Tertia heard these things from him, she saith to him:
&quot;I too would become a sharer and a handmaiden in this life which thou
teachest, and I too would become a servant to this God whom thou preachest, and
I would receive from Him this life which thou promisest, which He giveth to
those who come to His place of assembly.&quot;</p>

<p>Judas saith to her: &quot;The treasury of the heavenly King is
open, and every one who is worthy taketh and findeth rest; and when he hath
found rest, he becometh a king.   But at first a man cannot come near Him, when
he is unclean and when his works are evil; for He knoweth what is in the heart
and in the imagination, and no man can deceive Him. Thee too, therefore, if
thou really believest  in Him, He will make worthy of His holy mysteries; and
He will exalt thee, and enrich thee, and renew thy mind, and make thee an
heiress in His kingdom.&quot; </p>

<p>And when Tertia had heard these things, she went home rejoicing,
and found Mazdai her husband expecting her; and he had not dined. And he said
to her: &quot;Why doth thy coming in from the street seem more pleasing to me
today than on any other day? And why dost thou come on foot,—a thing that is
not proper for women like thee to do?&quot; Tertia saith to Mazdai: &quot;I owe
thee a debt of thanks that thou didst send me to Mygdonia. I went, and have
heard of the new life, and have seen the Apostle of the new God; and I believe
that he is the Apostle of God, who giveth life to every one who believeth in
Him and doth His will. It is my duty that I too should recompense thee for the
kindness which thou hast done me; and I will give thee a good counsel, so that
thou too shalt become a king and a prince in Heaven, if thou wilt be persuaded
by me and do what I say unto thee. I beseech thee to fear the God who hath come
hither by means of this stranger, and to keep thyself purely unto God;  
because this royalty of thine will pass away, and this rest of thine will be
changed into trouble. But come, go to that man, and believe in him, and thou
shalt live for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he heard these things from his wife Tertia, he smote his
face with his hands, and rent his clothes, and said: &quot;May the soul of Kar&#299;sh
have no rest, who hath brought this sorrow upon my soul! May he have no hope,
who hath cut off my hope!&quot; And he went out sore troubled, and found his
kinsman Kar&#299;sh in the street, and said to him: &quot;Why hast thou taken
me as thy companion unto Sheol? Why hast thou defrauded me, profiting thyself
naught? Why hast thou injured me, doing thyself no good? Why hast thou killed
me, not coming thyself to life? Why hast thou done a wickedness unto me, when
thou wast not in equity? Why didst thou not let me destroy that wizard before
he could corrupt my wife by his sorceries?&quot; And he was upbraiding Kar&#299;sh. 
Kar&#299;sh saith to Mazdai: &quot;What is this that hath happened?&quot;
Mazdai saith to Kar&#299;sh: &quot;He hath bewitched Tertia also.&quot;</p>

<p>And they two went to the house of Sîfûr the general, and found Judas sitting and
teaching. And all the people sprang up and stood, but Judas did not stand up
before them. And king Mazdai knew that it was he who was sitting; and he seized
a seat, and turned it over, and took it by the two legs, and beat him on the
head and smote him. And he seized him and delivered him to his attendants, and
said to them: &quot;Drag (him) off, that I may sit and hear him publicly.&quot;
And they were dragging Judas and going to the place where Mazdai used to give
judgement.</p>

<p>And when he came to the place, he was standing, whilst the
attendants of Mazdai held him. And Viz&#257;n, the son of king Mazdai, came and
said to the attendants: &quot;Give him to me, that I may talk with him until
the king cometh;&quot; and they gave him to him. And he took Judas, and went
within to (the place) where the king used to sit and judge. Viz&#257;n saith to
him: &quot;Thou knowest that I am the son of king Mazdai, and that I have
liberty to say to the king all that I wish; and that, if I tell the king, he
will let thee live, and if I tell him, he will kill thee. Now tell me, who is
thy God? And by whose power dost thou hold fast and glory (in it)? And if it be
witchcraft, teach it to me, and I will speak to the king, and he will let thee
go.&quot;</p>

<p>Judas saith to Viz&#257;n: &quot;Thou art the son of Mazdai, this 
king who  passeth away; and I am the servant of Jesus, the king who abideth for
ever. Thou hast power to speak to thy father, and to preserve alive those whom
thou pleasest in this short life, in which men abide not, even when thou hast
given it to them; and both thou and thy father are mortal. And I beg of my Lord
and beseech of Him on behalf of men, and he giveth them the new life, which
lasteth for ever. Thou gloriest in men and in slaves, and in riches and garments
and attendants, and in concubines, and in meats which pass<br>
away, and in the bed of uncleanness; and I glory in poverty and asceticism and
contempt, and in fasting and prayer and great thanksgiving, and in the
communion of the brethren and of the Spirit of holiness, and in the intercourse
of the brethren, who are worthy before God to live in everlasting life. Thou
takest refuge with a man like unto thee, who cannot even deliver his own soul
from judgement and from death; and I take refuge with Him, who is the Condemner
and the Absolver and the Great, and who is the Judge of all men. Thou and he
with whom thou takest refuge are today and tomorrow, and after a time ye are
not; and I take refuge with Him who is for ever, and who knoweth all times and
seasons. Thou too, therefore, my son; if thou wishest to become the servant of
this God whom I serve, canst become His quickly. And thou art seen to be His
servant by these things which I mention unto thee,—by purity, the chief of all
good qualities, and the great beginning, and the returning to a better state,
and the communion of this God whom I preach; and by cleanness and by temperance,
and by love and by faith and by hope in Him, and by simplicity of pure
life.&quot; And the youth Viz&#257;n was persuaded through our Lord, and was
seeking some way by which he might rescue Judas.</p>

<p>And whilst he was considering, the king came. And the attendants
came and took Thomas, and led him out; and Viz&#257;n too went out with him,
and was standing beside him. And the king took his seat, and sent (and) had
Judas brought in, with his hands bound behind him. And when he stood before
him, the king said to him:&quot;Tell me, who art thou, and by whose
power dost thou these things?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;I am a man like
to thee, and I do these things by the power of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of
God.&quot;    Mazdai saith to him: &quot;Speak truly, ere I destroy thee.&quot;
Judas saith to him: &quot;Thou hast   not   power over me, as thou thinkest,
and thou canst not make me suffer.&quot; And when Judas  had  said  these  things,
king Mazdai was enraged, and gave orders to heat two plates of iron and to make
him stand upon them barefooted. And when they had made him sit down, they drew
off and took away his shoes, and he was laughing and saying: &quot;Far better
is thy wisdom, Jesus, than all the wisdoms of all men. Do Thou take counsel
against them; and let Thy loving-kindness make preparation against the anger of
these (men).&quot; And they brought the plates (glowing) like fire, and laid
hold of Judas to make him step upon them; and suddenly much water rose out of
the earth, and the plates were immersed in it, and the men let him go and fled.</p>

<p>And when the king saw the abundance of water, he said to Judas:
&quot;Ask of thy God, and He will deliver us from this death by the flood,  and
we shall not die thus.&quot; And Judas prayed and said: &quot;Our Lord Jesus, I
ask of thee, bind this nature <i>(or </i>element) and confine it to one place.
Thou hast distributed it to various places, and hast   given many wondrous
signs through Thy servant and Thy Apostle  Judas. Thou that makest my soul long
that I too may receive Thy splendour; Giver of the reward of all my labours;
Thou that lettest my soul be at rest with its own nature, without any
intercourse of the harmful (one); Thou that art the cause of my life at all
times; do Thou make this flood cease, that it may not rear itself proudly and
destroy; for there are (some) of these who are standing by, who shall believe
in Thee and live.&quot; And when Judas had prayed, there was quiet; and by
little and little those waters were swallowed up and disappeared, but the place
became as if it had been dried up (by drought).</p>

<p>And when king Mazdai saw (this), he said: &quot;Drag (him) off to
prison, till we can consider what we shall do with him.&quot; And Judas went to
be imprisoned, and the whole people were coming after him; and Viz&#257;n, the
son of king Mazdai, was coming at the right hand of Judas, and Sîfûr the general
at his left hand. And when Judas had entered the prison, he permitted Sîfûr and Viz&#257;n,
and the wife of Sîfûr and
his daughter, to sit down, because they too had gone in with him, that they
might hear the word of life, for they knew that king Mazdai would destroy him
because of his great anger.</p>

<p>And Thomas began to say: &quot;Thou deliverer of my soul from the
slavery of many, because I gave myself to be sold unto one, now, lo, I am glad
and rejoice, because I know that the times and the seasons, and the years and
the months and the days, are at an end, and I shall come and receive Thee, my
giver of rest. Lo; I shall be delivered from (the things) of to-day and of
to-morrow, and it is for to-day that I care. Lo, I shall give up hope, and
receive truth. Lo, I shall escape from the sorrow and the gladness of every
day, and put on joy alone. Lo, I shall be without care and without sorrow and
without distress, and shall dwell in rest for ever. Lo, I shall be set free
from slavery, and shall go to the liberty unto which I am called.    Lo, I have
waited upon times and seasons, and (now) I am raised above times and seasons.
Lo, I shall receive my pay from a Paymaster, who doth not enter into a
reckoning but giveth (freely), because His wealth sufficeth for all His gifts.
Lo, I shall take off, and I shall put on and not take off any more. Lo, I shall
lie down to sleep, and I shall arise and not lie down to sleep any more. Lo, I
shall die, and I shall live and not die any more. Lo, they shall rejoice and
look on me, because I shall go and be united with their joy, and they shall
place flowers in their garlands. Lo, I shall be made a king in Thy kingdom,
Jesus, for from hence have I hoped for it. (Lo,) the wicked shall be put to
shame, who thought to subdue me by their powers. Lo, the rebellious shall be
destroyed before me, for I have risen above them. Lo, I shall have the peace,
unto which the great shall be assembled.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst Judas was saying these things, all those who were there
were listening, and were thinking that his departure from the world would be at
that moment.</p>

<p>And again Judas said: &quot;Believe in the Healer of all pains,
hidden and manifest, and the Giver of life to those souls which ask help of
Him; this, the freeborn and King's son, who became a slave and poor; this, the
healer of His creation, and the sick because of His servants; this, the
purifier of those who believe in Him, and the despised and insulted by those
who did not hear Him; this, (who)  setteth free  His  possessions from slavery
and from corruption and from subjection and from loss, and is made subject to
and insulted by His slaves; this, the Father of (Heaven) above, and the Lord of
all creatures, and the Judge of the world; this, who came from on  high, and
became visible through the Virgin Mary, and was called the son of Joseph the
carpenter; this, the littleness of whose body we have seen with our eyes, and
whose majesty we have received through faith; this, whose holy body we have
felt with our hands, and whose sad aspect we have seen with our eyes, and whose
Divine form on the mount we were not able to see by ourselves alone; this, who
was called an impostor, and who is the True, that deceiveth not, and the payer
of the tax and the head-money for us and for Himself; this, of whom the enemy,
when he saw Him, was afraid, and trembled; and asked Him who He was and what
was said of Him, and He did not make known to him the truth, because there is
no truth in him; this, (who;) though He was the Lord of the world and of its
pleasures and of its wealth and of all its delights, put them away from Him,
and admonished those who hear Him and believe in Him not to make use of these
(things).&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had finished saying these things, he stood up to pray,
and spake thus: &quot;Our Father, who (art) in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come; and Thy will be (done) on earth as in Heaven; and give us the
constant bread of the day; and forgive us our debts and our sins, that we too
may forgive our debtors; and bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from
the evil (one). My Lord and my God, and my hope and my confidence, and my
teacher and my comforter, Thou  didst  teach us to pray thus. Lo, Thy prayer I
am praying, and Thy will I am accomplishing. Be Thou with me until the end;
Thou, who from my youth hast sown life in me, and hast guarded me from
corruption; Thou, who hast brought me to the poverty of the world, and hast
prepared me for Thy true wealth; Thou, who hast made me know that I am Thine,
and I have not come near to woman, that what is desired by Thee might not be
found with stain. My mouth sufficeth not to praise Thee, nor my understanding
to glorify Thy goodness which (is) upon me; Thou who, when I was wishing to
acquire and become rich, didst show me by Thy vision that harm cometh to many
from wealth and from possessions, and I believed Thy vision, and abode in
lasting poverty, until Thou, the true wealth, didst manifest Thyself unto me,
and didst fill with Thy true wealth those who are worthy of Thee, and didst
deliver them from need and from care and from avarice. Lo, then, I have
fulfilled Thy will and accomplished Thy work. I have been poor and needy, and a
stranger and a slave, and despised and a prisoner, and hungry and thirsty, and
naked and barefooted and weary for Thy sake. Let not my trust fail, nor my hope
which (is) in Thee be put to shame. Let not my labours be in vain and let not
my toils be found fruitless. Let not my fastings and my urgent prayers perish,
and let not my works which (are) in Thee be changed. Let not the enemy snatch
away Thy wheat-seed from Thy land, and let not his tares be found in it; for
Thy land cannot receive his tares, and they cannot fall into the garners of Thy
husbandman.&quot;</p>

<p>And again he was saying: &quot;I have planted Thy vine in the
land; may it cast out roots downwards, and may its tendrils twine upwards, and
may its fruits be seen in the land, and may those, who are worthy of Thee and
whom Thou hast acquired, delight in them. Thy silver, which Thou gavest me, I
have cast down upon Thy table try it, and give it to me with its usury, as Thou
hast promised. With Thy talent I have gained ten; let them be added to what was
mine, as Thou hast promised. To my debtors I have remitted the talent; let not
that which I have remitted, be demanded at my hand. To the supper  I have been
invited and have come quickly, and have excused myself from the field and the
plough and the wife; let me not &quot;be cast out from it, and let me not eat
of it by reason of adjurations. To the wedding-feast I have been invited, and I
have put on white garments; may I be worthy of it, and may my hands and feet
not be bound, nor I be put out into outer darkness. My lamp is bright with His
light; let its Lord keep it until He leaves the banquet-room and I receive it;
(and) may I not see it sputter by reason of its oil. Let my eyes receive Thee,
and let my heart rejoice that I have fulfilled Thy will and accomplished Thy
commandments. Let me be like to the wise and God-fearing servant, who with
prudent diligence neglecteth nothing. I  have  wearied  myself with  watching 
the whole night to protect my house from robbers, that it might not be broken
into. My loins are girded with truth, and my sandals are bound on my feet;  
their thongs may I not see loosened. I have put my hand to my ploughshare, and
have not looked behind me, that my furrows might not be crooked. My fields are
white and are already fit for reaping;   may I receive my reward. The garment
that weareth out I have worn out, and the work that bringeth unto rest I have
accomplished. I have kept my first watch, and second and third; may I receive
Thy Face, and worship before Thy holy beauty. I have pulled down my barns and
destroyed them on earth; may I take of Thy treasure that faileth not. I have
dried up the running spring that was in me; may I lie down by Thy living spring
and rest beside it. The bound, whom Thou didst deliver to me, I have slain; the
unbound, who is in me, do Thou set free, and let not my soul be kept back from
its trust. The internal I have made external, and the external internal; let
Thy will be fulfilled in all my members. I have not turned back, and I have 
not stretched forward; let me not be a wonder and a sign. The dead I have not
brought to life, and the living I have not put to death, and the deficient I
have (not) filled up; let us receive the Crown of victory, the Ruler of both
worlds. Scorn have I received on earth; a recompense do Thou make me in Heaven.
The powers shall not perceive me, nor the rulers take counsel against me; the
tax-gatherers shall not see me, nor the collectors of tribute oppress me. The
low shall not mock at me, and the wicked at the brave and the humble; nor shall
the slave and the mean and the great,  who exalteth himself, dare to stand
before me, because of Thy victorious strength, O Jesus, which surroundeth me;
for they flee and hide themselves from it, because they are not able to behold
it; for with treachery and in silence do they fall upon those who obey them.
The portion of my children, lo, crieth out and shineth, and no man is hidden
from them, because it is the fragrance of their nature. &quot;Wicked men are
separated (from them); their fruit-tree is bitterness; I will make it pass away
to their place in silence, and I will come unto thee. Let joy and peace support
me, and I shall stand before Thy glory; and let not the slanderer look upon me,
but let his eyes be blinded by Thy light, in which I dwell, and let his lying
mouth be closed, for he hath naught against me.&quot;</p>

<p>And again he began to say to those who were with him in prison:
&quot;Believe, my children, in this God whom I proclaim. Believe in Jesus the
Messiah, whom I preach. Believe in the Life-giver and Helper of His servants.
Believe in the Giver of life to those who toil at His work; in Him, in whom,
lo, my soul now rejoiceth, for the time is come that I may go and receive Him.
Believe in this fair (One), whose beauty inciteth me to say concerning Him what
He is, though I am unable to say it fully. For Thou, my Lord, art the Feeder of
t my  poverty, and  the  Supplier of my want,  and  the Dispenser of my need.
Be Thou with me to the end, that I may come and receive Thee.&quot;</p>

<p>And the youth Viz&#257;n, the son of king Mazdai, was asking of
him and saying to him:  &quot;I beg of thee, holy man, Apostle of God, permit
me to go, and I will entreat the keepers of the prisoners, and they will grant
me that thou mayest go with me to my house, and thou shalt give me the sign of
life, and I too shall become a servant of this new God whom thou preachest;
because in all these things which thou sayest I was walking in my youth, until
my father Mazdai constrained me and gave me Manashar (as) a wife. For I am
twenty-one years old today, and lo, it is seven years since I was united in
marriage to a woman; for before I took a wife, I knew no other woman, and by my
father I was counted as good for naught. And I have not yet had son or daughter
by the woman whom he gave to me, and my wife hath lived with me in chastity
during these years. And today, if she were well, and had seen thee or heard thy
word, I should be at rest and she would live and would receive everlasting
life; for she is in great affliction, lo, a long time, through disease. I will
therefore entreat the keepers of the prisoners, if thou wilt promise me to go
with me to my house, for I live alone in a house by myself, and wilt heal the
feeble who is sick.&quot; And when Judas, the Apostle of the Most High, heard these
things, the Apostle saith to Viz&#257;n: &quot;My son, if thou believest, thou
shalt see the wonders of our God, how He bringeth to life and hath compassion
upon His servants.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst they were speaking, Tertia and Mygdonia and Narkia her
nurse were standing at the door of the prison; and they gave 360 silver <i>z&#363;z&#275;
</i>to the keepers of the prisoners, and they let them in to Judas. And they
entered and saw Judas and Sîfûr and Viz&#257;n, and the wife and daughter of Sîfûr, and all the
prisoners, sitting and listening to Judas. And they three stood before him, and
he said to them: &quot;Who let you come to us? And who opened to you the gate
that was closed in your faces?&quot; Tertia saith to him: &quot;Didst thou not
open the door for us and say to us, 'Come to the prison, that we may go and
take our brethren who are there, and then our Lord will show His glory (in
dealing) with us?' And when we came to the door (of the prison), thou didst
disappear from us, and we heard the sound of the door which was shut in our
faces. And we gave (money) to their keepers, and they let us in; and lo, we
stand (here) and beg of thee that thou wouldst do what we wish, that we might
let thee escape, until the wrath of king Mazdai  cool towards thee.&quot; Judas
saith to Tertia: &quot;Tell us first how ye were shut up.&quot; Tertia saith to
him: &quot;Thou thyself hast never quitted us, save for a moment, and dost thou
not know how we were shut up? But if thou wishest to hear, hear. King Mazdai
sent and had me Tertia brought to him, and said to me: 'That conjuror hath not
yet got power over thee, because I have heard that he bewitcheth with oil and
water and bread and wine, and he hath not yet bewitched thee. But harken unto
me, then, (and hear) what I say unto thee, that I will not torture thee until I
destroy thee; for I know, that as long as he hath not given to thee water and
oil and bread and wine, he hath not yet got full power over thee.' And I said
to him: 'Whatever thou wilt, do unto me.    Over my body thou hast power to do
all that thou wilt; but my soul I will not destroy with thee.' And when he had
heard these things from me, he shut me up in a dark room beneath his
dining-room. And his kinsman Kar&#299;sh too brought both Mygdonia and Narkia,
and shut <i>     </i>them up with me. And light did not depart from us, and
thou thyself didst bring us out, and lo, we stand before thee. But give us the
sign, and let the hope of Mazdai be cut off from me, who is plotting these
things against me.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Judas, the Apostle of our Lord, had heard these things
which she said, he saith: &quot;To Thee be glory, Jesus, manifold in form I To
Thee be glory, who showest Thyself like to our poor humanity! To Thee be glory,
our Strengthener and Encourager and Reprover and Gladdener, who standest by us
in all our afflictions, and  strengthenest  our weakness,  and encouragest our
fear!&quot; And when he had said these things, the prisoners were encouraged,
and the keepers said: &quot;Blow out the lamps, that they may not slanderously
accuse us before king Mazdai.&quot; And they blew out all the lamps, and went 
(and)  slept. But Judas said to our Lord: &quot;Thine now is the speed (to help
us), Jesus our Illuminator, for lo, the children of darkness have made us sit
in their darkness; but do Thou, our Lord,  enlighten us with the light of Thy
nature.&quot; And instantly the whole prison was bright as by day; and all
those who were  shut  up  there  were asleep, and only those who I believed in
our Lord were awake.</p>

<p>And Judas said to Viz&#257;n: &quot;Go before us, and prepare for
us what is needful for our service.&quot; Viz&#257;n saith to him: &quot;Who will
open for us the doors of the prison? For lo, they have closed them all, and the
keepers are asleep.&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;Believe in Jesus, and doubt
not, and thou shalt go and find the doors open and turned on their
hinges.&quot; And when he had gone out, he went before them, and all (the rest)
of them were coming after Judas. And when they had gone   half-way, Manashar,
the wife of Viz&#257;n, met them, coming to the prison. And she knew him  and
saith to him: &quot;My brother Viz&#257;n?&quot;    And he saith to her:
&quot;Yea, and thou my sister Manashar?&quot; She saith to him:
&quot;Yea.&quot; He saith to her: &quot;Whither goest thou at this time alone?
And how wast thou able to arise from the bed?&quot; She saith to him:
&quot;This youth laid his hand upon me, and I was healed. And I saw in my
dream, that I should go to the stranger, where he is imprisoned, that I might
be quite healed.&quot; Viz&#257;n saith to her:   &quot;Where is the youth, who
was with thee?&quot; And she saith to him: &quot;Dost thou not see him? For lo,
he is holding my right hand and supporting me.&quot;</p>

<p>And whilst they were talking, Judas came, with Sîfûr and his wife 
and daughter, and with Mygdonia and Tertia and Narkia, and they came and
entered into the house  of Viz&#257;n. And when Manashar,  the wife  of Viz&#257;n,
saw him, she bowed down and worshipped him, and saith to him: &quot;Art thou
come, my healer from sore disease? Thou art he whom I saw in my dream, who
didst give me this youth, that he might bring me unto thee to the prison; and
thy kindness did not suffer thee (to permit) that I should become weary, but thou
thyself art come to me.&quot;   And when she had said these things, she turned
round (to look) behind her, and the youth was not (there). And she saith to
Thomas: &quot;I am not able to walk alone, and the youth, whom thou didst give
me, is not (here).&quot; Judas saith to her:</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus then will be a Supporter unto thee.&quot; And she was
running and coming before them. And when they entered into the house of Viz&#257;n,
the son of king Mazdai, the time was night, and our Lord was giving them light
in abundance.</p>

<p>And Judas began to pray and to speak thus: &quot;Companion and
Help of the feeble; Hope and Confidence of the poor; Refuge and Rest of the
weary; Voice that came from on high, comforting the hearts of Thy believers;
Resort and Haven of those that go forth into the region of darkness; Physician
without fee, (who) wast crucified among men for many, and for whom no man was
crucified; Thou didst descend into Sheol with mighty power, and the dead saw
Thee and became alive, and the lord of death was not able to bear (it); and Thou
didst ascend with great glory, and didst take up with Thee all who sought
refuge with Thee, and didst tread for them the path (leading) up on high, and
in Thy footsteps all Thy redeemed followed; and Thou didst bring them into Thy
fold, and mingle them with Thy sheep. Son of perfect mercy, who wast sent to us
with power by the Father, whom His servants praise; Son, who wast sent by the
supreme and perfect Father-hood; Lord of possessions that cannot be defiled;
wealthy (One), who hast filled Thy creation with the treasure of Thy wealth;
needy (One), who bore poverty and fasted forty days; Satisfier of our thirsty
souls with Thy blessing; be Thou, Lord, with Viz&#257;n and with Tertia and
with Manashar, and gather them into Thy fold, and mingle them with Thy number,
and be to them a guide (when they are) in the path of error. Be to them a
healer in the place of sickness; be to them a strengthener in the weary place; make
them pure in the unclean place; and make them clean of corruption in the place
of the enemy. Be a physician for their bodies, and give life to their souls,
and make them holy shrines and temples, and may the holy Spirit dwell in
them.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had prayed thus, he said to Mygdonia: &quot;My
daughter, strip thy sisters.&quot; And she stripped them, and put girdles  on
them, and brought them near to him. And Viz&#257;n came near first.    And
Judas took oil, and glorified (God) over it, and said: &quot;Fair Fruit, that
art worthy to be glowing with the word of holiness, that men may put Thee on
and conquer through Thee  their  enemies, when   they have been cleansed from
their former works,—yea, Lord,   come, abide upon this oil, as Thou didst abide
upon the tree, and they who crucified Thee were not able to bear Thy word. Let
Thy gift come, which Thou didst breathe upon Thine enemies and they went
backward and fell upon their faces, and let it abide upon this oil,  over which
we name Thy name.&quot; And he cast it upon the head of Viz&#257;n, and then
upon the heads of these (others), and said: &quot;In Thy name, Jesus the
Messiah, let it be to these persons for the remission of offences and sins, and
for  the  destruction of the  enemy, and for the healing of their souls and
bodies,&quot; And he commanded Mygdonia to anoint them, and he himself anointed
Viz&#257;n. And after he had anointed them, he made them go down into the water
in the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit of holiness, And after
they had been baptized and were come up, he brought bread and the mingled cup,
and spake a blessing over it and said: &quot;Thy holy Body, which was crucified
for our sake, we eat, and Thy life-giving Blood, which was shed for our sake,
we drink. Let Thy Body be to us for life, and Thy Blood for the remission of
sins. For the gall which Thou drankest for us, let the bitterness of our enemy
be taken away from us. And for Thy drinking vinegar for our sake, let our
weakness be strengthened. And (for) the spit which thou didst receive for us,
let us receive Thy perfect life. And because Thou didst receive the crown of
thorns for us, let us receive from Thee the crown that withereth not. And
because Thou wast wrapped in a linen cloth for us, let us be girt with Thy
mighty strength, which cannot be overcome. And because Thou wast buried in a
new sepulchre for our mortality, let us too receive intercourse with Thee in
Heaven. And as Thou didst arise, let us be raised, and let us stand before Thee
at the Judgement of truth.&quot; And he brake the Eucharist, and gave to Viz&#257;n
and Tertia, and to Manashar and Sîfûr and Mygdonia, and to the wife and
daughter of Sîfûr, and
said: &quot;Let this Eucharist be to you for life and rest and joy and health,
and for the healing of your souls and of your bodies.&quot; And they said,
&quot;Amen&quot;; and a voice was heard saying to them, &quot;Yea and
Amen.&quot; And when they heard this voice, they fell on their faces. And again
the voice was heard saying: &quot;Be not afraid, but only believe.&quot;</p>

<p>And Judas went (back) to be imprisoned, and likewise Tertia and
Mygdonia and Narkia, these too went (back) to be imprisoned.    And Judas said
to them: &quot;My daughters and sisters in our Lord, and my companions, and
handmaidens of Jesus the Messiah, listen unto me on this the last day that I
shall deliver my word unto you, for I shall never speak with you again in this
world. For I shall be lifted up to our Lord Jesus the Messiah; to Him who sold
me; to Him who humbled His lofty soul to my littleness, and hath brought me to
His greatness which passeth not away, and hath deemed me worthy of being a
servant of Him in verity and in truth. And lo, I rejoice that the time is
fulfilled and the day come that I may go and receive my reward from my Lord.
For my Pay-master is just, and He knoweth how, I ought to be recompensed. For
He is not wicked nor envious, but His gifts abound; and He doth not count and
give, for He is confident that His wealth will not fail. Listen, my daughters.
I am not Jesus, but I am the servant of Jesus.    I am not the Messiah, but I
am one who ministereth before Him. I am not the Son of God, but I pray and beg
that I may be deemed worthy of God. But do ye, my daughters, abide in the faith
of Jesus the Messiah, and look for the hope of the Son of God. And be not
weary, my daughters, in persecution, and be not in doubt because ye see me
treated ignominiously, and imprisoned too, and dying, because I am fulfilling
the will of my Lord. For if I were to pray that I should not die, ye know that
I am able (to do so); but this which is seen (by us) is not death, but a release
from the world. For this reason I receive it gladly; and for this reason I am
delivered, that I may go and receive Him who is comely, Him whom I love, Him
who is beloved. For much have I toiled in His service, and I have completed
(my task) because of His grace, which hath supported me and hath not forsaken
me. Let not therefore the enemy enter into you by treachery, and let him not
agitate your minds with doubt. Let not that perfidious disturber find an
opportunity (of assailing you), because He, whom ye have received, and in whom
ye have believed, is stronger than he. Look for His coming, for He will come
and receive you, that is (to say), ye shall go and see Him.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Judas had finished speaking to them, they entered into
the dark house. And Judas said: &quot;Our Life-giver and Bearer of many things
for our sake, let these doors be as they were, and let them be sealed with
their seals.&quot; And he left them and went himself too to be imprisoned; and
they were grieved and were weeping, because they knew that king Mazdai would
kill him.</p>

<p align=center>The Consummation of Judas Thomas. </p>

<p>AND when he had gone in to be imprisoned, he found the keepers
quarrelling and saying: &quot;What wrong have we done to this sorcerer, that he
hath opened the doors by the art of his charms, and hath wished to let all
these prisoners escape? But let us go and make (it) known to king Mazdai, and
let us tell him also about his wife and his son, who come to him.&quot; And
whilst the chief (keeper) of the prisoners was saying a these things, Judas was
silent and listening.    And they rose early in the morning, and went to king
Mazdai, and say to him: &quot;Our lord the king, either let this sorcerer go,
or imprison him in another place, for we are unable to guard him; because twice
thy good fortune hath guarded the prisoners, otherwise they would all have
escaped; for we shut the doors and we find them open.    And both thy wife and
thy son, with the rest of the people, never leave him.&quot; And when king
Mazdai heard these things, he went to look at the seals which he had placed
upon the doors; and he found the seals as they were. And he said to the
keepers: &quot;Why do ye tell lies,  for  lo, the seals of the houses are as
they were sealed? And how say ye (that) Tertia and Mygdonia come to him to the
prison ?&quot; The keepers say:  &quot;We have told thee the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>And king Mazdai went (and) sat in (the hall of) judgement, and
sent and fetched Judas, and stripped him and put a girdle round his loins; and
they made him stand before Mazdai. And Mazdai said to him: &quot;Art thou a
slave or a free man?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;I am a slave, but thou
hast no power whatever over me.&quot; Mazdai saith to him: &quot;And how didst
thou run away (and) come to this country?&quot;    Judas saith to him : &quot;I
came hither that I might give life to many by the word, and by thy hands I
shall quit the world.&quot; Mazdai saith to him: &quot;Who is thy master? And
what is his name? And of what country art thou?&quot;Judas saith to
him: &quot;My Master is thy Master and (the Master) of the whole world, and the
Lord of Heaven and of earth.&quot; Mazdai saith to him: &quot;What is his
name?&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;Thou art not able to hear His true name
now at this time, but the name that is given to Him is Jesus the Messiah.&quot;
Mazdai saith to him: &quot;I have not been in haste to destroy thee, but have
had patience with thee; and thou hast added to thy deeds, and thy sorceries are
spoken of through the whole country. But I will do unto thee (so) that they shall
accompany thee and go along with thee, and that our country shall be relieved
of them.&quot; Judas saith to him: &quot;These sorceries, which thou sayest
shall accompany me, shall never fail from this place.&quot;          </p>

<p>And when he had said these things, Mazdai was considering, how he
should give orders concerning him, that he might die, because he was afraid of
the great multitude which was there; for many believed in our Lord, even
(some) of the king's nobles. And Mazdai took Judas and went without the city,
and there came with him a few soldiers with weapons; and people were thinking
that Mazdai was wishing to learn (something) from him, and they were standing
and looking at him. And when they had gone about half a mile, he delivered him
to (some) of the soldiers who were with him and to one of the princes, and said
to them: &quot;Go up on this mountain (and) stab him.&quot; And he turned to
come (back) to the city.</p>

<p>And people were running after Judas to rescue him; but the
soldiers were going on his right hand and on his left and were holding spears,
and that one of the princes was holding him by his hand and supporting him. And
Judas said: &quot;O the hidden mysteries, which even to the (hour of) departure
(from this world) are fulfilled in me! O the riches of the grace of Him, who
doth not let us feel the sufferings of the body! How they surround me with
weapons, and fight with me even unto death! But to One I am given up, for lo,
one chief leadeth me and holdeth me by my hand, in order that he may deliver me
to One, whom I look for that I may receive Him; and our Lord, because He is of
One, suffered (blows) at the hand of one.&quot;</p>

<p>And when he had ascended the mountain, the place where they were
about to stab Judas, he said to those who were holding him: &quot;Harken unto
me now at least, when I am on the point of departing from the world, and let
not the eyes of your hearts be blinded, nor your ears be deafened, that ye too
should not hear. Believe in this God whom I preach, and walk not in your
hardness of heart, but walk in all the virtues that beseem the freedom and the
glory of men and the life that is with God.&quot; Judas saith to Viz&#257;n:
&quot;Son of the earthly king Mazdai, and servant of Jesus the Messiah, permit
the attendants to do the will of their king Mazdai; I will go (and) pray.&quot;
And Viz&#257;n spake to the soldiers, and they let Judas go. And Judas went and
was praying and saying thus:—</p>

<p>&quot;My Lord and my God, and my Hope and my Saviour; and my Guide
and Conductor in all the lands which I have traversed in Thy name, be Thou with
all Thy servants, and do Thou guide me too that I may come unto Thee; for unto
Thee I have committed my soul, and no man shall take it from Thy hands. Let not
my sins | hinder me. Lo, Lord, I fulfilled Thy will and became a slave, for the
sake of this freedom which I am receiving! today. Do Thou, Lord Jesus, give
(it) to me and fulfil it with me; for I am in no doubt whatever regarding Thy
truth and Thy love, but for the sake of these who are standing (by) that they
may hear, I speak before Thee.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Judas had prayed thus, he said to the soldiers:
&quot;Come, fulfil the will of him who sent you.&quot; And the soldiers came
(and) struck him all together, and he fell down and died. And the brethren were
weeping all together. And they brought goodly garments and many linen cloths, and
buried Judas in the sepulchre! in which the ancient kings were buried.</p>

<p>And Sîfûr and
Viz&#257;n would not go down to the city, but were sitting there the whole day,
and they passed the night there also. And Judas appeared unto them and said to
them: &quot;I am not here. Why are ye sitting and watching me?&quot; I have
ascended unto my Lord, and have received what I was looking for and hoping for.
But rise and go down hence, for yet a little while and ye too shall be gathered
unto me.&quot; And Mazdai and his kinsman Kar&#299;sh brought Mygdonia and
Tertia, and afflicted them much, but they would not yield to their wish. And
Judas appeared to them and said to them: &quot;Forget not, my daughters, Jesus
our Light, the Holy and the Living (One), and He will soon prepare for you your
rest and your help.&quot; And when king Mazdai and his kinsman Karish saw that they would not be persuaded by them, they left
them alone to walk according to their own will. And all the brethren who were
there were assembling together, and praying and offering the (Eucharistic)
offering and breaking (bread), because Judas had made Sîfûr a priest and Viz&#257;n
a deacon, on the mountain, when he was going to die. And our Lord was helping
them with His love and was increasing His faith by their means.</p>

<p>And it happened after a long time that one of the sons of king
Mazdai had a devil, and no man was able to bind him, because he was very
violent. And king Mazdai thought in his mind and said: &quot;I will go (and)
open the grave of Judas, and take one of the bones of the Apostle of God, and
will hang it upon my son, and he will be healed.&quot; And Judas appeared to
him in a vision, and said to him: &quot;Thou didst not believe in one living;
wilt thou believe in one who, lo, is dead? But fear not. My Lord the Messiah
will have mercy upon thee because of His clemency.&quot; And he did not find
his bones, for one of the brethren had taken them away secretly and conveyed
them to the West. And king Mazdai took (some) of the dust of that spot where
the bones of the Apostle had lain, and hung it upon his son, and said: I
believe in Thee, my Lord Jesus; now that he hath left me, who always troubleth
men that they may not see the light.&quot; And when he had hung (it) upon his
son and had believed, he was healed; and he was united with the brethren. And
king Mazdai was bowing his head beneath the hand of the priest Sîfûr, and was
entreating and begging of all the brethren that they would pray for him, that
he might find mercy with them before our Lord Jesus the Messiah in His kingdom,
which is for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here end the Acts of Judas Thomas, the
Apostle of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who suffered martyrdom in the land of
India by the hands of king Mazdai. Glory to the Father and to the Son and to
the Spirit of holiness, now and at all times and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
