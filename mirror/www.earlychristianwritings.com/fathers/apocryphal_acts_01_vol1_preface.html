<h3 align="center">PREFACE</h3>
<p align="center">----</p>
<p>The documents which these volumes contain, in text and translation, are the
following:—</p>
<p>1. The history of S. John at Ephesus, taken from two vellum manuscripts, the
one of the vi<sup>th</sup> cent., the other of the ix<sup>th</sup>. The former
is in the Imperial Public Library of St. Petersburg, the latter in the British
Museum.1. The St. Petersburg manuscript consists of 142 leaves, written in a
fine, regular Estrangela, in double columns. The quires were originally signed
with both letters and arithmetical figures. Fol. 54, which is misplaced, is a
later addition, of about the xi<sup>th</sup> cent., in a cursive hand. [Title,
Syriac] The contents are:—The Doctrine of Addai at Edessa, [Title, Syriac]
fol. 1 b (Add. 14,644, fol. 1 <i>a</i>); the Doctrine of Simon Peter at Rome,
[Title, Syriac] fol. 33 <i>a</i> (Add. 14,644, fol. 15 <i>b</i>); the History of
S. John at Ephesus, fol. 38 <i>b</i>; the Invention of the holy Cross by the
empress Helene, fol. 74 <i>b</i> (Add. 14,644, fol. 18 <i>b</i>); the Martyrdom
of Judas, who became bishop of Jerusalem by the name of Cyriacus, fol. 84 b
(Add. 14,644, <A NAME="pviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|viii</SPAN></A> fol. 23 <i>b</i>);
the History of the eight Youths of Ephesus, fol. 92 <i>a</i> (Add. 12,160, fol.
147 <i>a</i>, and elsewhere); the Life of Gregory Thaumaturgus, bishop of
Neo-Caesarea, fol. 101 <i>a</i> (Add. 14,648, fol. 125 <i>a</i>); and the Life
of Basil of Caesarea by Amphilochius of Iconium, fol. 117 <i>a </i>(Add. 12,174,
fol. 125 <i>a</i>). The volume belonged to the convent of S. Mary Deipara in the
desert of Scete, according to the note on fol. 142 <i>b</i>: [Syriac] This book,
and three others from the same convent (the two Books of Samuel and the Pauline
Epistles, both according to the Pesh&#299;&#355;t&#257; version, and the
Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius, dated A.D. 462), were withheld by a Greek
named Pacho from the Trustees of the British Museum, who had made use of his
services in the acquisition of the Nitrian collection, and were sold by him, in
1852, to the Imperial Public Library of St. Petersburg, for the sum of 2500
silver rubles. They have been carefully described by Professor Dr. Dorn in the
&quot;Melanges Asiatiques,&quot; t. ii., p. 195. I am indebted for the use of
this manuscript, —which would have given invaluable aid to Dr. Cureton in the
publication of his &quot; Ancient Syriac Documents&quot; (compare my Catalogue
of Syriac MSS. in the British Museum, part iii., p. 1083, no. DCCCCXXXVI.)-—to
the liberality of the Imperial Government of Russia, which is always ready to
place its scientific treasures at the disposal of scholars of every nation. To
his Excellency M. Deljanoff, the Director of the Imperial Public Library, my
warmest thanks are due for the promptitude <A NAME="pix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ix</SPAN></A>
with which he acceded to my application for the loan both of this volume and of
the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius. Would that the management of all similar
institutions were conducted on equally liberal principles!</p>
<p>2. Of the manuscript in the British Museum, Add. 17,192, it is unnecessary to
give a detailed description in this place, as I have described it minutely in my
Catalogue, part ii., p. 778, no. DCCLXXXIX.&nbsp; It is of the ix<sup>th</sup>
cent, and was one of the 250 volumes, which were collected and conveyed by the
abbat Moses of Nisibis to the convent of S. Mary Deipara in the year 1243, A.D.
932.</p>
<p>These Acts, which are obviously translated from the Greek, being of
comparatively late date, and to all appearance destitute of any historical
basis, are chiefly valuable from the linguistic point of view. The fact of
Eusebius of Cæsarea being named as the author (p. 3), combined with the mention
of &quot;Urh&#257;i of the Parthians&quot; at p. 54, suffices, I think, to show
that the work was written after the story of the conversion of Abgar, king of
Edessa, by Addai, had become generally known, that is to say, after the
publication of Eusebius's Ecclesias­tical History, or about the middle of the
fourth century. The Greek original, however, is, so far as I am aware,
unpublished, if indeed it be still extant.</p>
<p>II. The Decease of S. John, taken from a vellum manuscript in the British
Museum, Add. 12,174, which is dated A. Gr. 1508, A.D. 1197 (see my Catalogue,
part iii., p.1123, no. DCCCCLX.). This is a translation of the latter portion of
the Greek text edited by Professor <A NAME="px"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A> Dr.
von Tischendorf in his &quot;Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha&quot; (Leipzig, 1851),
from the beginning of chapter 15 (p. 272) to the end.</p>
<p>III. A section from the <i>&#928;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#953;</i>.
of S. Philip, which is, I believe, not extant, or at least unpublished, in the
original Greek, narrating the conversion of the Jew Hananiah or Ananias, and, by
his means, of the city of Carthage. I have taken it from a manuscript in the
Library of the Royal Asiatic Society of London, which, was placed at my disposal
by my friend Mr. Eggeling, the secretary and librarian of the Society. This is a
paper manuscript, consisting of 188 leaves, all more or less stained by water,
and some of them slightly torn, especially foll. 1 and 97. The quires,
twenty-one in number, mostly of ten leaves, are signed with letters (except the
last two, which have no signatures). Leaves are wanting after foll. 6, 21, 49,
125, 166, and 172. The volume is written in a good, regular, Nestorian hand,
with many vowel-points, <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><sup> </sup>and dated (see
fol. 92 <i>b</i>) A. Gr. 1880, A.D. 1569. The name of the scribe was Elias. The
contents are :—</p>
<p><i>a. </i>The theological treatise of 'Ebed-Yeshua', metropolitan of Sob&#257;,

<p><i>d. </i>The narrative, or vision, of Abba Zosimus &quot;regard­ing the
holy men who were removed from this world, by the command of God, in the days of
Jeremiah the prophet&quot; (the Rechabites; see Jeremiah, ch. xxxv.). Fol. 93 <i>a</i>.
See Add. 12,174, fol. 209 &amp; (in my Catalogue, part iii., p. 1123, no.

&quot;Journal of Sacred Literature&quot; and in my &quot;Contributions to the
Apocryphal Literature of the New Testament.&quot;</p>
<p><i>j. </i>The history of John bar Malk&#275;, or John of Rome. Fol. 161 <i>b</i>.
Imperfect. Of this there are several copies <A NAME="pxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xii</SPAN></A>

in the year 1916,&nbsp; A.D. 1605, by a person whose name has been blotted out,
fol. 1 <i>a.</i></p>
<p>IV. The Acts of S. Matthew and S. Andrew, translated from the Greek. See
Tischendorf, Acta Apostt. Apocrypha, p. 132, and compare Professor Dr. von
Gutschmid's article &quot; Die Königsnamen in den apokryphen Apostelgeschichten,&quot;
in the Rheinisches Museum für Philologie, Neue Folge, Bd. xix., p. 390. My text
is taken from Add. 14,645, which was written A. Gr. 1247, A.D. 936. See my
Catalogue, part iii., p. 1111, no. DCCCCLII.</p>
<p>V. The history of S. Paul and Thecla, translated from the Greek. See
Tischendorf, Acta Apostt. Apocrypha, p. 40, and Von Gutschmid's article, loc.
cit., p. 177. My text with its various readings is taken from four
manuscripts:—&nbsp; <A NAME="pxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiii</SPAN></A></p>
<p><i>a.</i> Add. 14,652, of the vi<sup>th</sup> cent., denoted by the letter A.
See my Catalogue, part ii., p. 651, no. DCCXXXI. This manuscript is older by
several cen­turies than any of the Greek codices used by Tischendorf.</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Add. 14,447, of about the X<sup>th</sup> cent., a small frag­ment,
denoted by the letter B. See my Catalogue, part L, p. 98, no. CLVI.</p>
<p><i>c. </i>Add. 14,641, of the X<sup>th</sup> or xi<sup>th</sup> cent, denoted
by the letter C. See my Catalogue, part iii., p. 1042, no. DCCCCXVIII.</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Add. 12,174, dated A.Gr. 1508, A.D. 1197,denoted by the letter D.
See my Catalogue, part iii., p. 1123, no. DCCCCLX.</p>
<p>VI. The Acts of S. Thomas, or Judas Thomas (i.e.; the Twin), taken from Add.
14,645 (see above, no. IV.).</p>
<p>I regard this piece as the gem of my small collection, since we have here,
for the first time, these Acts in a nearly complete form. The portions which are
extant in Greek have been edited by Tischendorf, Acta Apostt. Apocrypha, pp.
190—234 and 235—241, but they cover less than half of the Syriac text, viz.,
[Syriac] and even here there are considerable differences. For example the
fourth act of the Syriac (pp. [Syriac]) is altogether wanting in the Greek; and
at page [Syriac] the two texts deviate widely from one another (Compare my
translation, p. 173, with that in Clark's Ante-Nicene Christian Library, vol.
xvi., p. 408). On the origin and composition of the whole document see the
above-mentioned article by Von Gutschmid, pp. 161 and 179.&nbsp; <A NAME="pxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiv</SPAN></A></p>
<p>Whatever may be the ultimate conclusions to which a careful examination of
these Acts may lead biblical and historical critics, I feel almost certain of
two things. Firstly, we have here the Syriac version of a Greek text very
similar to that from which the Latin translation, which passes under the name of
Abdias, was made. Notwithstanding sundry notable differences, the two works are
substantially the same, allowance being made for a constant tendency to
abridgement on the part of the Latin translator. As examples of such differences
I may mention the omission of the third and fourth acts in the Latin, the
variations in the account of the examination of S. Thomas by king Mazdai (Fabricius,
pp. 714—7l8),&nbsp; and&nbsp; the &nbsp;transposition of the prayer of S.
Thomas (Fabricius, p. 731). On the other hand, the Syriac text offers us the two
hymns of S. Thomas, of which there is not a trace in the Latin redaction.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secondly, the Syriac text, even in its present shape,&nbsp; is of great
antiquity; I am inclined to think , not later than the fourth century.&nbsp; I
ground this opinion on the number of rare and curious words which it contains ,
some of which are as yet unknown to me and to other scholars, whom I have
consulted.&nbsp; Such are [Syriac]. <A NAME="pxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xv</SPAN></A></p>
<p>In preparing the present work for publication, my intentions and methods have
been the same as heretofore. I wish to appear simply as an editor and
translator, not as a commentator and historical critic. As editor, I have sought
to reproduce the text of the manuscripts, to&nbsp; which I had access, as
closely and accurately, as possible. Where I have made alterations, they are
distinctly noted for the information of the reader. My translation I have
striven to make as literal as possible; I am fully aware that it is at times
painfully so. I am content, however, like Cureton, to leave my work in this
shape. Some one, who wishes to earn a cheap reputation for <A NAME="pxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xvi</SPAN></A>
scholarship, may perhaps, a few years hence, think it worth his while to issue a
new edition of the book; revise my translation and make it read more smoothly,
correcting (let us hope) some mistakes whilst he does so; incorporate my notes
with his own; and then lay claim to have produced a translation which may fairly
be considered as independent&quot;,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and which the
more ignorant or careless among his readers will probably assume to be the <i>first</i>
English version.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Such has been the fate of
Cureton's &quot;Ancient Syriac Documents&quot; in this country, and such may
possibly be the fate of my &quot;Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles.&quot;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have to thank Mr. Bensly of the University Library,
Cambridge, Dr. Hoffmann of Göttingen, Professor Dr. Nöldeke of Kiel, and
Professor Dr. Sachau of Vienna, for the counsel and assistance which they have
given me from time to time. The Dean of Canterbury read the Syriac sheets after
they had passed' through the press, and from him I have received many useful
notes and observations; whilst Mr. Thompson, the Assistant-keeper of the
Manuscripts in the British Museum, has aided me in revising and correcting the
proof-sheets of the translation.</p>
<p>To Canon Lightfoot I am indebted in a different way, for it is his liberality
alone, which has rendered the publication of this work possible. Being unable to
find a publisher for it, I had actually abandoned my design and sent a notice to
Leipzig, for insertion in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, offering
my materials to any German scholar who would undertake the labour of making a
translation. This being accidentally mentioned to Canon Lightfoot, he wrote to
me, proposing to defray the whole cost of publication, a generous offer of which
I thankfully availed myself. To him, therefore, I dedicate the book, hoping that
he may find the result of my labours not wholly unworthy of his acceptance.</p>
