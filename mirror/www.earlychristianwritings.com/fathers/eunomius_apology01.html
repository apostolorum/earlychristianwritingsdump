<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN>&nbsp;To calumniate and abuse any one, is the Employment of an ungovern'd Tongue, and of an ill Temper of Mind: 'tis indeed the business of troublesome Persons,  and of those who are skill'd in nothing so much as in<I> </I>Strife and Enmity.   But to endeavour, with all chearfulness,  to  shew   the  Falshood   of those Lyes, in those that are themselves misrepresented as Impious by such Calumnies, 'tis a part of Prudence, that they may shew their own sincere Inclinations; and that they esteem. the Safety of the multitude of Christians as a thing of mighty consequence.   We could
<A NAME="p2"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|2</SPAN></A>&nbsp; wish therefore, as not being ignorant of either of those Cases, not to be Partakers with the former sort; nor indeed to have any occasion to act the part of the latter. But since the Success of things has not answer'd our Wishes, and we have after various manners, and in several instances, endur'd ill-grounded Censures and Indignities, both in Words and Actions,  from many Persons;  which things are grievous to us, and of mischievous consequence to the Faithful :  and  since this has been done by such as are themselves wicked, and care not what  they either say or  do; and others, who are weak and simple, do measure the Truth by the Calumnies of the many, and not by exact Justice; and do not examine with Judgment the Truth of  the Accusations brought against us; We have thought fit to make a Profession of our own Faith in writing before you, both on our own account, by way of <I>Apology</I>; and to make others more cautious as to those things that are said without any examination against us. If perhaps by this  means we  may overcome that reproachful Character which is already spread abroad<I>, </I>and may make ill Men less daring, and those that   are  too   light and foolish more careful how  they believe, hereafter : and may thereby at once shew the Weakness of those that  spread the Lyes, and the Incautiousness  of  those   that believe them : while this Course will at the same time demonstrate the truth of what we say, and what Punishment will ensue to both those sorts of Persons.   For the being joint Partners in the propagation of Lyes, will bring down a common Punishment upon both of them.
<A NAME="p3"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|3</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;Now above all things we beg of you, both <I>you </I>who shall hear what we say at prefent, and <I>you </I>who shall afterward light upon this Apology, not to think of measuring Truth and Falshood by multitudes, as reckoning that Truth which has the greater number on its side; nor so far to be influenc'd by the worldly Dignities of some, or the Haughtiness of others, as to suffer your Minds to be blinded; nor indeed to be so prejudic'd by what you have first heard, as to stop your ears against an After-examination: But to prefer the Doctrine of our Saviour Jesus Christ before the regard to any number of Men, to Ambition, the Love of Disputation, nay to Custom, and Relation; in short, to all things whatsoever that are wont to darken the Faculties of the Soul; and so to pass sentence upon what shall be said, with a Mind only dispos'd to embrace Truth. For a peculiar Alliance of the Mind to Truth, is of the greatest consequence towards the discovery of it.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>III.</SPAN>&nbsp;We must farther desire of you not to be displeas'd at us, if we have no regard to the Pride or Terror of any, nor to that Favour, or Security which the present World might afford; but ever prefer that Tranquillity which arifes from the Hopes of a future World; and still look upon those Threatnings which are made against the wicked, as more to be dreaded than temporal Death; and in consequence hereof publish the plain Truth. For, as the Apostle says, <I>The Sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory
which shall be revealed</I>.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Nor is the whole World, tho we were sure of its Enjoyments and Dominion, capable to compensate the
<A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> loss of one's own Soul:  The future things vastly exceeding those that  are prefent on each  side;  both as to enjoying Happiness, and as to suffering Punishment.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>IV.</SPAN>&nbsp;But that we may not be too
tedious in this Preface, and prolong our Discourse beyond measure, let us now come   directly   to the <I>Profession of our Faith</I>; whereby those that have a mind may most easily and readily understand our Opinion.   For it is necessary that those who are to discourse of these things, and to undergo an Examination of their proper Doctrines, do not give up themselves at random to the Opinion of the <I>many</I>, but that they have in their view all the way that <I>Sacred Tradition </I>which has obtain'd originally from our forefathers, as a sort of Rule and Guide; and to permit Men to make use of that as an exact Standard in the  distinguishing  and  judging of those
things that are to be said.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>V.</SPAN>&nbsp;&quot;We believe in One God the Father Almighty, of whom are all things.&nbsp;<br>
  And in One only-begotten Son of God, God the Word,  our Lord  Jesus Christ,  by whom are   all things.&nbsp;<br>
    And in One Holy Spirit the Comforter, by whom the Distribution of all Grace is bestow'd on every one of the Saints, according to their proportion, to profit withal.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>VI.</SPAN>&nbsp;This is the most simple Creed, and common to all who either are careful to appear, or to be Christians; as being an Abridgment, or as it were an <I>extempore </I>Summary only; omitting, at present the additional Articles which have been controverted, and thinking it
<A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A> superfluous to make mention of them. As to our selves, if we could perceive that those who once had received the <I>Words</I>,<I> </I>did necessarily preserve together with those words the
<I>true and invariable Sense </I>contain'd under them; or if we perceiv'd that those who accuse us of <I>Impiety</I> would upon this Profession of our Faith presently free us from their Accusations, and let all sinister Suspicions against us go out of their minds, we would take this Creed for the Measure and Standard of our own Discourse: that this Profession of our Faith might procure us Peace and Security. For indeed neither was <I>Sabellius </I>of <I>Libya, </I>nor <I>Marcellus
</I>of <I>Galatia, </I>nor <I>Photinus, </I>nor any other of those that proceeded to the like degree of Madness with them, excluded from the Sacred Assemblies, or the Participation of the Mysteries, or the peculiar places appointed for Ecclesiastical Persons. But because neither is this short Profession sufficient for the Settlement of the Truth, nor sutable to our
purpose, to silence the Accusations brought against us, but some more accurate Explications will be necessary, in order to the plain and full Declaration of our Mind ; and because, out of an ill Temper, or some other disorder of Disposition, several do endeavour to misrepresent and corrupt the true Sense of the words; We shall make it our business, as
well as we are able, to explain distinctly what Notions we have of these matters; by first setting down our Faith, and then explaining its meaning afterwards: or suting the words to the Sense which lies before us; but so that this Change shall no ways be to the prejudice of the Truth, And indeed this method will
<A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A> be peculiarly sutable to our purpose, both as we write an <I>Apology </I>for our selves, and a <I>Confutation </I>of our Adversaries.&nbsp;
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>VII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Therefore, We own, according to natural Sense, and according to the Doctrine of our Forefathers, <I>One God, not made either by himself, or by another;
</I>for both those things are equally impossible: for most certainly the <I>Maker </I>must exist before that which is <I>produc'd, </I>and that which is <I>made </I>must be after that which <I>made it , </I>nor can any thing be sooner or later than it self; nor can any thing be before God.   For certainly that which  is   before  the other, would then have had  the Dignity of the Godhead.   For he that affirms it possible for a real Being to be made by another, must allow that it self is one of them; and that it will justly be rank'd among them.  Wherefore, if it be demonstrated that neither could God be before himself,   nor could any thing else
be before him, but that he is before all things, it thence follows that  he is the <I>Unbegotten</I>, or rather, he is himself the <I>Unbegotten Substance.
</I>It may indeed probably seem needless and superfluous to some to prove those things, as if they were doubtful, which are commonly taken  for granted.    However, it seems proper for us, on account of those that look on it  as a piece of wisdom to oppose the plainest things, as well as of those that may otherwise  take a handle for Complaint and Calumny, to treat more accurately of these matters.&nbsp;
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>VIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Now when   we own God to be <I>Unbegotten, </I>we think we ought not to do it by using that word only in our Worship, after a vulgar  acceptation,  but  to pay  in   reality that Debt to God which is of all other the
<A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A> most justly due, that is, the acknowledging him to be what he really is.   For those Ideas<SUP> </SUP>which are in the Mind only, and the Words  belonging to them having no real existence elsewhere, as distinct from those Names whereby we express them, are dissolv'd and vanish when we forbear to speak of them.   But God, whether we are silent, or speak, and while things come into being, and before all things were made, both was, and is <I>Unbegotten.</I>
</P>
<P>But then he is not such by way of <I>Privation</I>, seeing Privations belong to the nature of things already in being, and after the Habits to which they belong. But according to the Course of Nature, there could be no Generation as to God, nor had he therefore a Generation formerly, which when he was depriv'd of, he was stil'd, <I>Without Generation, </I>or <I>Unbegotten</I>: since this would be great Impiety, and destructive of the true Notion of God, and of his absolute Perfection. Indeed to pretend that God has been deprived of somewhat naturally belonging to him, would be a Demonstration of the Madness of the Inventors of such an Opinion. And no wise Man can say that any Being is depriv'd of such things as did not before exist. If therefore the Character of <I>Unbegotten </I>is not a bare Imagination, nor us'd by way of <I>Privation, </I>as the last reasoning has shew'd: Nor is this Character of <I>Unbegotten </I>apply'd to God in part only; for he is without Parts. Nor is it apply'd to him as allowing somewhat different from him, within him, that is Unbegotten; for he is simple, and uncompounded, nor is any [internal] thing different from him beside him, for he is
<A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A> <I>One and alone: </I>he must himself be the <I>Unbegotten Substance.&nbsp;   </I>
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>IX.</SPAN>&nbsp;Since therefore, according to the foregoing Demonstration,  he is Unbegotten, he cannot so admit of any Generation from him, as to communicate his own proper Nature to  any Being that is made,; and must be far <I>remov'd from all Comparison, </I>and Fellowship,  with what is made.   For if any one would determine that he has somewhat common with another, or does communicate to any one his own Substance, it must be either by <I>Division  </I>and  <I>Separation</I>, or by  <I>Coalition. </I>But whether of these two ways be asserted, the Notion will be intangled with many Absurdities,  or rather so many Blasphemies. For whether it be by <I>Division </I>and <I>Separation, </I>he must be no longer the <I>Unbegotten</I>; being now by this Division become what he was not before :  nor indeed <I>Incorruptible</I>,<I>   </I>while this Division is destructive of that Perfection of <I>Incarnation.   </I>Or whether it be by that Coalition  which  he admits with another,  this Coalition depending  on that wherein  they both partake, the Character of <I>Substance </I>must be common to them both: and if so, the Name also must be common; [and each be<SUB> </SUB>call'd  the Unbegotten Substance.]    So that they must be forc'd by this reasoning either to keep the Name incommunicable, as being willing that the Character of <I>Unbegotten Substance
</I>mould be also esteem'd incommunicable; or else if they attempt to allow the Communication of the Substance, together with that, will they be forc'd to own the Name to be common also.   For the desire of aggrandi<I>z</I>ing both will be defective, if they give but one part to the one, while the other enjoys
<A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A> both; nor will they vouchsafe to explain the reason of such difference; nay, are more nice as to the word than as to the thing it self.
---- But if they own one to be greater and the other less, seeing we have prov'd that when a thing is granted, the word ought to be granted also; let them use the word <I>Unequal</I>: but if they deny that, let them not fear to use the word <I>Equal </I>in this case; as not finding to  which the Supereminence is to be ascrib'd.&nbsp;
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>X.</SPAN>&nbsp;For they cannot pretend to say the <I>Substance </I>is common to both, but as to Order, and the Prerogative of greater antiquity in point of time, the one is first and the other second: since we   acknowledge   in all things that have any Prerogative, the Cause of that Prerogative.   Now neither <I>Time</I>, nor <I>Age, </I>nor <I>Order </I>have any connexion with the Substance of God.   For <I>Order </I>is posterior to him that orders: But nothing that belongs to God is order'd by another Being.   And <I>Time </I>is a certain motion of the Stars; and the Stars were later, not only than the Unbegotten Substance,  and all intelligent Natures, but than the Elements or primary Bodies also. And as to the <I>Ages, </I>what occasion is there for  any farther reasoning? when the Scripture plainly affirms that God existed before the Ages; and the common Motions of Mankind  do attest the same Truth also.    For 'tis not only impious, but exceeding ridiculous for those who admit of but one Unbegotten Being, to affirm that somewhat else exists either <I>before him, </I>or <I>together with </I>him. For if any Being, existed <I>before him, </I>that Being has a just Title to this Character of <I>Onbegotten
</I>and not the second.   If it existed <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A>
only <I>together with him, </I>by this Communion between these, so as to coexist together, both the <I>Unity </I>of God, and the Character of <I>Unbegotten
</I>will be taken away. But for those who, together with the Communication of the Substance, do introduce a certain Partition and Boundary on both sides, they must suppose a mutual Agreement, nay and besides an Author of that Agreement.&nbsp;
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>XI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Now 'tis plainly impossible that any things should have place in the Essence of God, of such a Nature as Species, or Magnitude, or Quantity; because on all accounts God, must be free from all Composition. But now, if it can never be agreeable to Piety, to suppose these or any the like Circumstances connected with the
Substance of God, how can Reason admit us to equal a <I>Begotten Substance</I> to that which is <I>Unbegotten?
</I>seeing that all Likeness, or Comparifon, or Communication of Substance leaves no Supereminence, or Difference, but implies a plain Equality; and by that Equality declares him that is so intire like the other, to be equally <I>Unbegotten </I>also. But no one is so mad and daring in his Impiety, as to assert that the Son is <I>Equal </I>to the Father, when the Lord himself expressly says, <I>The Father, who sent me, is Greater than I</I>:<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
or to apply both of the Names at random, while each claims the Appropriation, nor does admit the Communication thereof to the other. For if either Person be <I>Unbegotten, </I>he is not a <I>Son</I>; and if he be a <I>Son</I>, he is not <I>Unbegotten.
</I>But that there is only one God of the Universe <I>Unbegotten, </I>and <I>beyond all comparison, </I>besides the many Arguments omitted here, what we have said already upon that Subject does sufficiently demonstrate.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>XII.</SPAN>&nbsp;And there is but
<A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A> <I>one Son</I>, for he is the <I>Only begotten, </I>concerning<SUP> </SUP>which it were easy, by adding the Testimonies of Holy Men who have stil'd the Son a <I>Being Begotten, </I>and a <I>Being Made, </I>and by such a difference in their Expressions declaring the difference of their Substances, to prevent the occasion of any farther care and trouble. However, on account of such as suppose this to be like the Generation of Bodies, and so stumble at the Ambiguity of words, it will be necessary, I suppose, to speak briefly to this matter.
</P>
<P>
We therefore affirm the Son to be a <I>Being Begotten, </I>according to the Doctrine of the Scriptures; not imagining him one thing as to his <I>Substance, </I>and yet another thing to be describ'd by the <I>Words </I>apply'd to him; but that   he is the very same subsisting Being which   the   name signifies,   the Appellation rightly expressing the <I>Substance</I>; and that this subsisting Being was produc'd when he was not before  his own proper Production, but that he was <I>begotten  before all things, </I>by the <I>Will </I>of God and the Father.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>XIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;But if this Expression seem <I>over-bold </I>to any one, let him consider with himself whether it be <I>True </I>or <I>False</I>:<I>  </I>for if  the former, the Boldness is without blame, according to his own determination; since nothing that is <I>true, </I>if it be spoken in due time, and within due bounds, can be <I>culpable: </I>but if it be <I>False, </I>'tis absolately necessary that the opposite Doctrine must be esteem'd true, that is, that the Son, who <I>was in being before, was  begotten</I>;<I> </I>which does not only exceed all Absurdity or Blasphemy, but all the most foolish and ridiculous Opinions possible.    For what occasion for
<A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A> <I>Generation </I>to a Being that <I>exists already?   </I>unless it be chang'd into another Being , according to   the  nature   of both  living   and lifeless things, which any one may truly say to have that Being which already exists,   but not to have that Being into which they are made: For Seed is not a Man, nor are Stones an House; the former of which is made a Man, the latter an House.    Now if in every one of these Examples,   to which 'tis the greatest Instance of Piety to compare the Generation of the Son, those things only are <I>made </I>which were <I>not before, </I>what   Medicine must  he require who affirms that the Son, when he <I>was before, </I>was <I>produc'd</I> notwithstanding? For if he were before his Generation, he was <I>without</I> <I>Generation</I>,<I> </I>or <I>Unbegotten</I>;
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>XIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;whereas it has all along been fairly acknowledg'd, that there is <I>no other Unbegotten Being but God.
</I>Either therefore let them leave off this Profession,   when they introduce another <I>Unbegotten Being ; </I>or while they persist in the same, let them not pretend that the Son was <I>produc'd, </I>tho he <I>existed before</I>; since the Character of Son, and of a <I>Being Begotten,   </I>will not admit that of an <I>Unbegotten Substance.    </I>For by this means all imaginable Confusion of Names and of Things will arise,   while there is   but <I>one Substance </I>which is, and which is call'd <I>Unbegotten; </I>and yet in the same breath is there introduc'd <I>another:
</I>And after  all,  this other Being is nam'd a <I>Begotten Substance, </I>and is call'd a Son, tho <I>Unbegotten, </I>according to the same Person's Notion; and the other has the name of <I>Father </I>given him, without his begetting a Son, if the other indeed be <I>Unbegotten.</I>
<A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
But perhaps some body, aiming to cure one Malady with another, a lesser with a greater, according to the Proverb, will suppose a Generation by Augmentation or Mutation. This is to add one perverse reasoning to all the former, as not being sensible even of this plain Case, that if there be any Augmentation, it must be by the addition of somewhat else. Whence therefore is this Addition, but from some foreign Matter ? But if so, it will be absolutely necessary to suppose <I>many Beings, </I>many <I>Unbegotten Beings, </I>to supply the Defect of <I>one </I>alone.   But if the Augmentation be made out of nothing,  which is the more rational Supposition, to confess that every thing, was made when it was not in being before, by the Will of him that produc'd it;  than to say any Substance is a Composition made, partly out of what was in being, partly out of what  was not in being;  they must admit of a Mutation,   when there is  nothing to which that  Mutation could be made;  and when by consequence of necessity, the Mutation must be made into that which is  not. And how can it be other than foolish, not to say impious, to affirm, that what has a Being is chang'd into that which has none ? Indeed it will become us to leave off this prodigious Folly, or Madness rather, and to keep our selves to the words of Truth and Soberness.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>XV.</SPAN>&nbsp;But these Men, who are liable themselves, tho unwittingly, to these and many more Absurdities, do not with Justice lay the Charge of Boldness upon us, but in reality bring that of Impiety upon themselves.   For our parts, we persist in what has been antiently demonstrated by Holy Persons, and now by our selves; in
<A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A> affirming, that since neither the Substance of God admits of Generation [as <I>being Unbegotten</I>; nor of Separation or Division, as being <I>Incorruptible</I>;] nor is there any other Substratum for the Generation of the Son:   therefore the Son, when he was not before, was begotten.    Not thereby intending  that the <I>Substance of the Only-begotten   </I>was in common the same  with that  of those Beings which were made <I>out of nothing</I>; seeing what is not, cannot be any sort of substance.   But we determine, that the difference of all Substances depends on the Will of him that made them ; and accordingly we do ascribe such Supereminence of Substance to the Son, as 'tis necessary to suppose the Creator to be possess'd of above that of his own Creatures.   For we acknowledg,   according  to the blessed Apostle <I>John, </I>that <I>all things were begotten by
him</I>,<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> that Power of Creation being begotten together with him; whence he is the <I>Only-begotten God </I>to all Beings that are inferior to him,  and that were made by him.   For he alone was <I>begotten and created by the Power of the Unbegotten God,
</I>and so became the most perfect of the subordinate  Beings,  and <I>subservient </I>for   the Creation of all the rest,  and for the performance of his Father's Will.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>XVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;But now if, because of the names Father and Son, we must be oblig'd to suppose a kind of human and corporeal Generation; and from that Method of Generation among Men,   must introduce God as subject to the Imputations and Affections of a Change in his Substance,   We must also, according to the erroneous Opinion of the <I>Greeks</I>, because God is a <I>Creator</I>, introduce <I>Matter </I>for the Production of the Creatures.
<A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A> For Man, who <I>begets </I>out of his own Substance, if he were to <I>create, </I>could not do it without Matter.
But if they reject that Hypothesis, without regarding the strict use of Words which are imploy'd to express our meaning, because they must take care to ascribe none but worthy Notions to God; and so allow that he creates by his Power alone : how can it be necessary to think of the Affection of a Change of Substance in God, on account that he is stil'd a <I>Father? </I>For what Man of good Sense is there, but acknowledges that the names of some things do only agree in pronunciation and expression, but not at all in signification? as when an <I>Eye </I>is spoken of Man, and when it is apply'd to God: Of Man it denotes one distinct Member; but of God it denotes, sometimes his Help and Preservation afforded to the Righteous; and sometimes the Knowledg of the Actions of Men.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>XVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;As on the other hand, many words, which are different in pronunciation, have still the same signification; as <I>He that Is</I>;<I> </I>and <I>the Only True God.</I>
</P>
<P>
Wherefore when God is stil'd a <I>Father, </I>we ought not to suppose the same Operation or Efficacy which that word implies among Men;<I><SUB> </SUB></I>as if in both Cases it equally included some Emanation, or the like Affection; since the one is without all such Affections, and the other with them. Nor when he is said to be a <I>Spirit, </I>is he to be suppos'd to have the same nature with other Spirits. Accordingly should we in all things observe the like Equity and Proportion, and not as soon as we hear the name of <I>Son </I>apply'd to Christ, to be displeas'd at the name of a <I>Made Being</I>; as if the Substance were immediately to be suppos'd
<A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A> common, because of this Community of the name. For he is a Being, <I>begotten </I>and <I>made </I>by a Being, which was itself <I>unbegotten </I>and <I>unmade</I>; while Men and Angels, and whatsoever Creature there is beside, are <I>Beings made by that Being which was it self made,  </I>and produc'd by him at the Command of the Father.   For by this means we shall preserve the sacred Truth of the Scriptures, which affirm, that the Son is a<I> Being
made</I>,<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> and <I>produc'd</I> by God; and we shall not go astray from sober Reasoning, as neither being forc'd to ascribe Parts to God, nor lay his own <I>Substance </I>as a Substratum for Generation,  nor <I>Matter </I>for Creation, from which direst Notions the difference of these Names has arisen.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>XVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;How if God,  when he <I>begets,  </I>does not  communicate his own Substance to the Being that is begotten, according as happens among Men,  for he is <I>Unbegotten</I>; and when he <I>creates, </I>he does not stand in need of any Matter, since he <I>stands in need of nothing, </I>and is powerful; the rejection of the word <I>Creation </I>is on all accounts unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Now since from these and the like Arguments we have shewn, that we must neither attempt universally to think that the signification of Words is exactly agreeable to the Words themselves, nor to change that Agreement at random, but must attend to the Subjects we are upon; we must sute Words and their Signification together, with regard to that Agreement respectively: for the nature of things is not a Consequent of Words, but the Force of Words is, according to their respective kinds, to be suted to the nature of things. One may therefore very justly
<A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A> complain of those, who believing that the Son is a <I>Being Begotten, </I>and a <I>Being Made, </I>and are also persuaded that God is a <I>Being Unbegotten,<SUB> </SUB></I>and a <I>Being Unmade, </I>do yet, by the addition of other words, and by saying that they are <I>alike in Substance, </I>contradict what they confess'd before; while they ought, if they had had the least regard to Truth, from that difference of Characters, to have own'd the difference of their Substances; because they could only by this means preserve the just Order of Things: that is, by accommodating to each severally a sutable Acknowledgment. But if they have no consideration of this Agreeableness in the nature of things, yet ought they at least to take care, that their own Words agree with their own Notions, and not allow themselves to ascribe intirely different Characters to the same Nature; for we have demonstrated, by all our foregoing Discourse, that those Characters are significative of the Substances themselves.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C19"></A>XIX.</SPAN>&nbsp;But now perhaps somebody that is heated in this matter may argue thus, in way of contradiction to our Reasoning: that if we must thus strictly adhere to the words made use of, and thence be led into the meaning of the things, as we pretend that <I>Unbegotten </I>and <I>Begotten
</I>are so intirely different from one another; yet is it plain, that the names <I>Light </I>and <I>Light</I>, <I>Life </I>and <I>Life</I>, <I>Power </I>and <I>Power</I>, which are ascrib'd to both, are alike. To such an one's Question, we shall reply, not with the <I>Argument of the Staff, </I>instead of an Answer, according to the Saying of <I>Diogenes: </I>For the Philosophy of a Cynick is vastly remote from Christianity; but in imitation of the blessed
<A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A> Apostle <I>Paul, </I>who says,   <I>that we ought to instruct those that oppose themselves with great
Longsuffering</I>.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> We answer then, that <I>Light </I>is either <I>Unbegotten </I>or <I>Begotten</I>; and we ask whether when. <I>Light </I>is spoken of an <I>Unbegotten Being, </I>and of a <I>Being Begotten, </I>it signifies differently, or has the very same signification? If the very same, 'tis plain, that that must be a compounded thing which consists of different things. Now what is compounded, is not Unbegotten : But if it has a different signification, then as much difference as there is between  an <I>Unbegotten </I>and a <I>Begotten </I>Being, so much difference ought there to be suppos'd between <I>Light </I>and <I>Light, Life </I>and <I>Life, Power </I>and <I>Power.    </I>For there is but one Rule and Method for the Resolution of all such Difficulties.
</P>
<P>
If therefore every Character of the Father, which concerns his Substance,  be equivalent to that of <I>Unbegotten, </I>as to its proper signification,   on account of his being free from Parts, and not compounded; and if the Case be the same as to the <I>Only-begotten, </I>that every Character must be equivalent to that of a <I>Begotten Being, </I>and yet they will still say these Characters may be convertible; who can further endure that they should  use the word <I>Likeness of Substance? </I>or that they should determine one to have a Supereminence above the other as to Greatness, even tho all Consideration of Quantity, and, of Time, and the like Circumstances are set aside? and tho the Substance be, and is own'd to be simple and one?&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C20"></A>XX.</SPAN>&nbsp;And in the first place, they who presume to compare that Substance,   which has <I>no  Superior</I>,   <I>and   is above   all Cause,   and free from all Laws, </I>to that which is <I>Begotten, </I>and
<A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>
is <I>subservient to the Laws of its Father, </I>seem either not at all to consider the nature of Things, or not to form their Judgments about them with an uncorrupt Mind. For there are plainly two ways cut out for the Discovery of the Truth in such Questions;<I> </I>the one of which is <I>a priori, </I>whereby we confider the Substances of things themselves, and by fair and clear Reasoning we determine about every one of them; the other of which is <I>a posteriori, </I>whereby we make the Enquiry from the Effects to the Cause, and so distinguish Substances by the Creatures they make, and by their Operations. Nor is it possible to perceive that either of these ways can discover this Likeness of Substance.
</P>
<P>
For in case any one takes the Rise of his Enquiries from the Substances themselves, and finds that One is <I>superior to all Dominion, </I>and <I>above all Generation, </I>and <I>all Indigency</I>; This will teach a Mind that comes with a sincere Desire after Truth, and oblige it to reject with the greatest Indignation, from the very Law and Rule of Nature, all Companion between them; and will give us to understand, that the Operation must be sutable and agreeable to the Dignity of the Substance. But in case he first regards the Creatures made, and thence goes back to the Substances, when he finds the Son to be the <I>Being made by the Unbegotten Being, </I>and the Comforter the <I>Being made by the Only Begotten, </I>and is satisfy'd of the difference of the Operations by the Supereminence of the Only Begotten;<I> </I>he will thence perceive an indisputable Demonstration of the Difference of their Substances.
Not here to add a third Difference, <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
that be who creates by his own Power, must be vastly superiour to him that does it <I>at the pleasure of his Father, </I>and confesses that <I>he does nothing of himself</I>;<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> and he that <I>is ador'd, </I>from him that <I>adores.</I>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C21"></A>XXI.</SPAN>&nbsp;If therefore they esteem it not at all absurd to ascribe all these things equally to both, as for instance, Substance, Energy, Power, and Name, as intending to take away all diftinction both as to Names and Things; let them plainly call them both <I>Unbegotten Beings.
</I>But if this be a notorious piece of Impiety, let them not, under a colour, by using the word <I>Likeness, </I>hide that which is by all own'd for Impiety.
</P>
<P>
But lest we should seem to offer violence to the Truth by our own Fictions and Reasonings, as we are falsly accus'd to do; and that false Accusation is laid heavily to our charge by abundance of People : we will demonstrate what we aim at out of the Scriptures themselves.
</P>
<P>
There is but <I>one God, </I>who is <I>declared both by the Law and the Prophets : </I>and he is own'd by our Saviour himself to be the <I>God of the Only begotten. </I>For says he, <I>I go unto my God and your God. The only True God, the only Wise, and only Good, and only Powerful Being, </I>who <I>only has Immortality</I>.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Nor let any one be diforder'd or disturb'd in his mind at this. For we do not use this Language in order to take away the <I>Divinity </I>of the Only-begotten, or his <I>Wisdom, </I>or his <I>Immortality, </I>or his <I>Goodness, </I>but in order to put a difference between things; and to own the supereminent Dignity of the Father. For we acknowledg the only-begotten God and our Lord Jesus,
<A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A>
to be <I>Incorruptible, </I>and <I>Immortal, </I>and <I>Wise, </I>and <I>Good; </I>but we affirm that the Father is the <I>Cause</I> of his intire Being;, and of every thing that he is; who himself has no cause of his own Substance, or of his Goodness; as being Unbegotten : the foregoing Premises affording us this Notion.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C22"></A>XXII.</SPAN>&nbsp;If therefore he be the <I>only True God, </I>as being <I>only Wise, </I>and <I>only Unbegotten,
</I>the Son is his <I>Only Begotten, </I>because he alone is a Being begotten by the Unbegotten Being: which yet he would not be alone, if the Nature was common to both, on account of their Likeness.
</P>
<P>
We ought therefore to lay aside the Notion of <I>Likeness as to Substance, </I>and to embrace that of the Likeness of a Son to the Father, in agreement with his own words; that is, so to reduce the intire Cause and Origin of all to the <I>One and Only Being, </I>that the Son may be esteem'd subject to his Father. We ought also exactly to purify our Notions about these matters, and not to esteem the manner of his Operation to be after the manner of Men; but with ease, and divine : and not to esteem his Operation to be any fort of division, or removal of his Substance; such as those cannot avoid who are led by the Sophistry of the <I>Greeks, </I>and connect the Energy to the Substance; and because they suppose the World to be coeval with God, fall into all
sorts of Absurdities on that account. For those that allowed no Period to the World, no wonder that they assign'd to it no Beginning : nor would that cease or come to an end which was not deriv'd from a certain Beginning.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C23"></A>XXIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;But as to these <I>Greeks, </I>which never looked on the difference of
<A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A>
things with clear eyes, nor can be equitable Arbitrators, let them not be concern'd in these matters: since the just Judgment of God has hidden the Truth from them, on account of the Pravity of their Dispositions.
</P>
<P>
But then,  as  to   our selves, we do  not think it safe, as we have said a little before, to connect the Operation with the Substance: since we judg of it by its Works, and know the Substance to be without beginning, simple, and without end: but the Operation not to be without beginning; for if it were, the Work it self  would  be without beginning also, as well  as without end: since 'tis not possible for the Works to cease, and yet the Operation   never   to  do  so.   For 'tis very childish, and the reasoning of a very weak Mind,  to say the  Operation is unbegotten, and without end: and while they suppose it the same  with the Substance, yet   to  own that none of the Works can be made so as to be Unbegotten, or as to be without end. For one   of these  two things would  hence follow, either that the Operation of God did not operate,  or the Work  must be Unbegotten ; but if both of those Hypotheses are without question absurd, what remains must be true ; that because the Works have a beginning, the Operation was not without beginning;   and because  they  must cease,  so must the Operation cease also.
</P>
<P>
Wherefore we ought not to acquiesce in the Opinions of the <I>Greeks, </I>taken up without examination; and so to connect the Operation with the Substance; but to esteem the will of God to be the truest Operation; which is most worthy of God, and sufficient
<A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A>
for the Being and Preservation of all things; as the words of the Prophet do also attest: <I>For he hath done whatsoever he pleased. </I>For he does not stand in need of any being for the Constitution of those things he is pleas'd to make: but at the same time that he wills, what he pleases is made.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C24"></A>XXIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Wherefore if the Word of God demonstrates that his <I>Will </I>is his <I>Operation, </I>and not that his Substance is such; and that the Only-begotten subsisted by the <I>Will </I>of the Father; 'tis certainly necessary that the Son preserve this <I>Likeness, </I>not as to <I>Substance, </I>but as to <I>Operation,  </I>which is also   his <I>Will.    </I>Whence also we ought  to be persuaded to preserve that true Notion of his being his <I>Father's Image,  </I>which the  blessed Apostle <I>Paul </I>declar'd, when he said, <I>Who is the Image of the Invisible God, the first-born   of every Creature</I>;<I> for in him were all things created, both things in Heaven, and things  on Earth, visible and
invisible</I>.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> For therefore is he call'd, <I>The Image of God.    </I>Now these words, <I>All things were created in him, </I>together with the Appellation of the <I>First-born,  </I>do not give us the Character of an <I>Unbegotten Substance</I> : for here is nothing about <I>Substance, </I>but about that <I>Operation </I>whereby he, as  a Son,  performs all things.   The Expression of <I>Image  </I>does not bear any resemblance to the Substance, but to that Operation which  was hidden,   without any Generation, in God's Foreknowledg, even before the Constitution of the Son,  and of those   things which were created  in  him. For who is there that knowing the Only-begotten himself, and considering that <I>all things, were made by him</I>,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
will not acknowledg that <A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A>
he at once contemplates the whole Power of the Father ?   To   which  the  most   blessed Apostle <I>Paul </I>has respect, when he does not say <I>by him, </I>but <I>in him</I>,   altho he adds the Character  of <I>First-born:  </I>that when himself is also included, together with all the Beings made by him, he may make manifest to all that are able to comprehend  the whole at one view, the Operation of the Father.   We therefore call him the <I>Image  of the Father, </I>not as comparing a <I>Begotten Being </I>with that which is <I>Unbegotten</I>;<I> </I>for that is certainly disagreeable, and in all Beings impossible; but as owning him the <I>Only begotten, </I>and <I>First-born </I>of the Father : the appellation  of <I>Son </I>declaring the <I>Substance, </I>as does that of Father the  <I>Operation </I>of him  that  begat him. But if any one out of the love of Contention, and as fixt in his own Opinions, will not apply his Mind to what has been said, but yet is forc'd to own that the Character of <I>Father   </I>is significative   of the <I>Substance</I>;<I> </I>let him attribute the like Character to the <I>Son, </I>to whom he has already attributed the like <I>Substance.   </I>Or rather let him attribute both Characters to each   of them;<I> </I>we mean the Character of Son to the Father, and that of Father to   the Son.   For the Similitude of Substance obliges those who are of that opinion to characterize them both by the same Appellations.

</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C25"></A>XXV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Having now spoken sufficiently concerning the <I>Only-begotten, </I>Order requires that we discourse next concerning the <I>Comforter</I>;<I> </I>not following the Opinions of the many, which are taken up without examination, but keeping
<A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A> close to the Doctrine of Holy Men in all  things.    From whom, we  have learn'd that he is the <I>Third </I>in Dignity and Order; and do therefore believe that he is the Third in Nature also: not changing the Dignity and Nature according to the political Changes among Men, no more than we can change their Order, so that their Substances shall be contrary to their Creation, but agreeably to the Rules of Harmony; that so the First in order may not be Second in nature; nor that which is First in nature, may have only the Second or Third place in order.   Wherefore if the Order of Creation be the best Order in intelligent Beings, the Holy Spirit, which is the third as to Order, cannot be the first as to Nature: which is no other than God the Father.    For is it not foolish and vain, that the same Being should sometime have the First, and at other times the Third place ? and in both of them to be ador'd according to his nature, as the Lord  <I>God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship  him in Spirit and in
Truth</I>.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Nor is he the fame with the Only-begotten; for then he would not have been enumerated after him, as having a Subsistence of his own.    Our   Saviour's words being here in the first place sufficient, whereby he said expressly that he should be <I>sent
afterward</I>,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> for the instruction and teaching of the Apostles.    Nor is  he <I>numerically different </I>from God, and yet <I>Unbegotten </I>withal. For there is only <I>One Unbegotten </I>Being, from whom all things were made.    Nor is he a Being different from the Son,  and  yet a Being begotten.   For our Lord is but <I>One</I>; and the <I>Only-begotten; by whom are all
things</I>,<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A>
as the Apostle says: but he is the third in Nature and Order, made by the Command of the Father, and by the Operation of the Son; and honour'd in the third place, as the first, and  greatest, and  indeed the  only Being of this sort made by the  Only-begotten:  not endu'd with equal Power, Divinity, and the power of Creating, but endu'd with the compleat Power of Sanctification and Instruction. For as to those that believe the Comforter to be only a certain Energy of God, and yet do  still   enumerate him after  the two real Substances, they seem so very foolish, and so Intirely remote from Truth, that one must have great leisure indeed to think it worth while to confute them.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C26"></A>XXVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;But that we may not tire our Readers by the prolixity of our Discourse, we will contract the Sum of what has been said into a short compass, and say;
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
&quot;That there   is only <I>One true God,  </I>the <I>God of all things</I>, <I>Unbegotten, without Beginning,   and beyond Compare; superior   to   all</I> <I>Cause, the Cause of Existence to all Beings<SUP> </SUP>that are:
</I>not creating the World in common with another Being, [or by communicating himself to another:] Not the first in Order only, not somewhat greater upon the comparison only, and a little superior to them all; but by way of Supereminence, beyond all
compare, as to his Substance, his Power, and his Authority:<I> </I>One who before all things begat, and made the Only-begotten God, our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom all things were made; the Image and Representation of his own Power and Operation; who is himself not
<A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
to be compared with him that begat him, as to his Substance; nor to that Holy Spirit which was made by him: for he is inferior to the one, as a Being made by him; and superior to the other, as his Maker.&quot;
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Now that Christ was made, <I>Peter, </I>who, as our Lord  himself attests,   had  his <I>Knowledg from
God</I>,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> is an authentick Witness, when he says, <I>Let all the House of </I>Israel <I>know assuredly that God hath made him both Lord and
Christ</I>.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> And he that spake in the Person of the Lord, when he   said,   <I>The Lord created me the Beginning of his
ways</I>.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> And he that said, <I>There is one God, from whom are  all things;</I> and <I>one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things</I>.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> And the Blessed Apostle <I>John, </I>when he said, <I>All things were made by him;</I> <I>and without him was not any thing
made</I>.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> From whence it will follow, that either  the   Spirit  is <I>Unbegotten, </I>which is a piece of Impiety: or if he were made, he must have been made by him.    For we profess that the Son alone was made by the Father;   subordinate both in Substance, and Will: and himself owns that he <I>lives on account of the
Father</I>,<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> and <I>does nothing of himself</I>.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
Nor do we acknowledg him <I>consubstantial</I>; for that denotes such a Generation as implies Division of the Substance.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C27"></A>XXVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;For neither is the Father Begotten, nor the Son Unbegotten:  but what he ever is,   that is he truly call'd, a <I>Begotten Being, </I>an <I>Obedient Son, </I>a <I>most perfect Minister,   </I>as s<I>ubservient </I>in   the whole Creation to the Will of his Father, in order to the Constitution of things, and to their Preservation; and for the giving of Laws to Men, making use of the Comforter as his
<A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A>
Minister, for the dispensing of his Gifts, and exercise of his Providence; for Sanctification, for Instruction, and for the Confirmation of the Faithful: Who was himself in the last days born  of the  Virgin <I>Mary, </I>who convers'd holily, according to the Laws of God ; was crucify'd, and died, and rose again the third day, ascended into Heaven, will come again to judg the quick and the dead, by a righteous distribution to every one according to their Faith and Works; and is to reign for ever and ever.   So that the supreme Dignity and Monarchy of God is ever to be preserv'd in all things: <I>viz. </I>that the Holy Spirit, with all the other Beings, be own'd subordinate to Christ; and the Son himself to God, even the Father; according to the Doctrine of the Blessed Apostle <I>Paul, </I>who says thus : <I>For when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also  himself be subject unto him that put all things  under him;</I>  <I>that God may be all in
all</I>.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
</P>
<P>
We have elsewhere with greater care, and more largely demonstrated these things, which we have here in brief included in this Profession of our Faith.   And we beg of you of the present Age, and all others that are Partakers of the same Mysteries with us, not to fear the Censures of Men, nor to be impos'd on by their Sophisms,  nor seduc'd by their Flattery; but to pass your judgment upon what has been offer'd according to Truth and Equity; as suffering the better part to prevail, and preserring Reason before Prejudice, so as to fly  from  all the Snares and Nets which the Devil contrives against Mankind; and thereby thinks to affright, or at least to
<A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A>
allure   many of  those  who do not prefer what is really profitable before what is pleasant, nor  esteem things future  more secure than those that are present; that so the worser part may prevail over  some of them. But may God  avert any experience of this that I have said! tho there be many that conspire for Falshood, and are departed from the Truth; preserring the present Glory and Security   before things pleasing to God and truly useful.    May  he preserve the Faith of my Followers unmoveable and firm to him, that delivered it to them:, while they wait for the Judgment-Seat of our Saviour Christ;<I> </I>where all Haughtiness, and Glory, and Falshood will intirely vanish; and those that are to be judg'd must stand naked  of all their Authority and Attendance, and where Affluence and Riches, be they   here never so highly esteem'd among Men, is utterly insufficient   to put  their Adversaries to shame. For a multitude of Men in all their splendor is not there equivalent to one poor and pious Person; or able to cause his rejection, where Truth it self is to approve him.   It being agreeable to God's just Method of Retribution, that their Piety should plead for them at that day,  who do now, on its account, esteem Death it self to be Gain; while Christ, the Disposer of the Rewards, did formerly and still does render to every Combatant the Prize according to his Desert : to those that undergo great Labours for the Truth, true Liberty, and the Kingdom of Heaven; but to those that have dishonour'd it, from the Wickedness of their own Minds, inevitable Punishments.   And so much shall suffice on both

sides at present; and may all at last succeed for the best. <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>

<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C28"></A>XXVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;There is one God,
unbegotten, and without beginning; having neither any one before him; for
nothing can be before that which is unbegotten: nor with him; for the unbegotten
God is One and Alone: nor in him; for he is a simple and uncompounded
Being.&nbsp; But as he is One and Alone, and always the same, he is the God <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A>
and the Creator, and the Maker of all things; principally, and in a peculiar
manner of the only-begotten; yet properly of those things also which were made
by him.&nbsp; For he begat, and created, and made the Son alone before all
things, and before the whole Creation, by his Power, and Energy, not
communicating any thing of his own Substance to him that was begotten; for God
is incorruptible, and inseparable, and indivisible: and an incorruptible Being
does not communicate his own Substance; nor does he produce another which
subsists in him; for he alone is unbegotten.&nbsp; Now 'tis impossible that a
Being should be begotten which has its Substance unbegotten.&nbsp; He did not
therefore make use of his Substance, but of his Will only; and he begat him, not
by his own Substance, but as he pleased.&nbsp; And by him did God make the Holy
Spirit, the first and greatest of all the rest, by his own Authority <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A>
and Command; but by the Energy and Power of the Son.&nbsp; And after him he made
by his Son all the other Creatures which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth,
both visible and invisible, both corporeal and incorporeal.&nbsp; For there is
one God, from whom are all things; according to the Apostle: And one Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom are all things.&nbsp; There is therefore one unbegotten God,
uncreated, not made; and one Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, a Being begotten
of him that is unbegotten; tho not like other beings that are begotten: a Being
created by him that is uncreated; tho not like other created Beings; a Being
made by him that was not made; tho not like other beings that were made: as it
is said in the Holy Scriptures, The Lord created me the beginning of his ways,
for his works; he founded me before the world began; and before all the Hills
did he beget me.&nbsp; And one Holy Spirit, the first and greatest of all the
Works of the only-begotten, made indeed by the Command of the Father, but by the
Energy and Power of the Son.

references are those from Whiston:-- I have omitted the copious references to
the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>.&nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="eunomius_apology00_intro.html">introduction</a>
