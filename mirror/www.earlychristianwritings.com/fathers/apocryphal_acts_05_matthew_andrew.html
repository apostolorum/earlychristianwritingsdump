<h3 align=center>THE HISTORY OF<br>
M&#256;R MATTHEW AND M&#256;R ANDREW,  <br>
THE BLESSED
APOSTLES.</h3>

<p align=center>WHEN THEY  
CONVERTED THE CITY OF DOGS, THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH WERE CANNIBALS.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>

<p align="center">----</p>

<p>After the days of the ascension of our Lord
Jesus the Messiah to Heaven, when the days of Pentecost were fulfilled, and the Paraclete had come to the upper
chamber of Zion, and the holy Apostles were filled with the gift of the
Spirit of holiness, each of them had the wish to go forth and preach the Gospel
of the Messiah. And they began to cast lots and to distribute the countries
among them.    And it happened that, when they had cast lots, it fell to
Matthew the Apostle to go to the city of which the inhabitants were
cannibals.    And the inhabitants of that city neither ate bread nor drank
water, but their food was the flesh of men, and their drink too the blood of
men. And every man who entered into that city, its inhabitants seized, and dug
and put out his eyes, and gave him to drink a cup, which was mingled with
sorcery; and as soon as he drank that cup, his heart was changed, and his
understanding perished, and he got the heart of a beast.</p>

<p>And it happened that, when S. Matthew
entered within the gate of the city, the inhabitants of the city seized him,
and dug and put out his eyes, and gave him to drink the cup which was mingled
with sorcery, and conveyed him to the prison where every one was imprisoned who
fell into their hands; and they threw down
for him grass to eat.</p>

<p>And when the blessed
Apostle had drunk the cup which they gave him, his heart was not changed; but he was always in
urgent prayer and tears, saying: &quot;Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, for whose
sake we have left everything and follow Thee, because we know that Thou art
the true God, and the Helper and the Deliverer of all those who trust in
Thee,—look, Lord, and see what this hard-hearted people are doing to Thy
servant Matthew, how they have made me like unto the beast in which there is no sense; for Thou art the Knower of
everything. If thus be Thy will, O Lord<sub>;</sub> that I should become
food for the inhabitants of this city, let Thy will be accomplished; I will
not flee from Thy command. Give me the light of my eyes, that I may see what
the people of this city do with me. Do not, Lord, forsake me, and do not give
me up to this bitter death.&quot;                                               </p>

<p>And whilst the blessed Matthew was praying
thus, a mighty light shone through the whole place where he was imprisoned, and
a voice was heard from the light, saying: &quot;Matthew, my Apostle, lift up
thine eyes.&quot; And straightway he lifted up his eyes and saw. And again the
voice came unto him the second time and said: &quot;Matthew, be firm, and be
strong, and fear not; for I will not abandon thee, nor forsake thee; for I will
deliver thee from all temptations, and not thee alone but all thy companions,
for I am with thee at all times. And now endure in this thy prison-house
twenty-five days,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> for the help of the souls of many. And after these
things I will send unto thee Andrew, and he shall bring thee out of this prison
and all those who are with thee here.&quot; And when our Saviour had said these
things, He was lifted up to Heaven.</p>

<p>Then Matthew said: &quot;Thy grace be with
us, our Lord Jesus the Messiah.&quot; And he was within in the prison and was
singing. And it happened that, when the executioners came into the prison to
take out men for slaughter, Matthew shut his eyes, that they might not perceive
that he saw the light. And it happened one day, when the executioners came and
reached him, they read the ticket which was attached to his hand, and said
among themselves, &quot;In three days more we shall take out this one too and slaughter him;&quot; for they
used to write upon a ticket of wood the day on which a man was taken, and
to tie it to his hand, that they might know the completion of his days.</p>

<p>And it happened that,
when the twenty-seven days were completed, from (the time) that the blessed Matthew had been
seized, our Lord Jesus the Messiah appeared unto Andrew in the country in which
he was teaching, and said to him: &quot;Andrew, rise, go with thy disciples to the city of which the inhabitants are cannibals,
and take Matthew out of the prison in which he is; for after three days
those wretches are going to take him out and kill him for their food.&quot; And
Andrew answered and said: &quot;My Lord, I am not able within three days to go
to that city, because the way is long; but send an Angel to take him out
thence, for Thou, my Lord, knowest that I am clothed with flesh, and am not
able to arrive there quickly, neither do I know the way.&quot; And our Lord
answered and said to him: &quot;Andrew, listen, and obey Him who made thee and
brought thee into being; for He is able in the twinkling of an eye to command,
and that city would be lifted up and brought hither. For I will command the
wind, and it shall convey thee thither. But arise in the morning, and go down
to the sea-shore with thy disciples, and lo, thou shalt find a ship. Go on
board of it, thou and thy disciples.&quot; And when our Lord had said these
things, He gave him (the salutation of) peace, and was lifted up into Heaven.</p>

<p>Then Andrew arose in the morning, as he
had been ordered, and went to the sea-shore
with his disciples, and saw a small
vessel, and in the vessel three men were sitting; for our Lord by His
command had prepared a vessel, and He appeared in it in the likeness of a
sailor, and there were with Him two Angels in the likeness of men. And Andrew,
when he saw the vessel and the three men who
were in it, rejoiced (with) a great joy, and drew nigh unto the vessel,
and said to them: &quot;Whither are ye going,
my brethren ?&quot; And our Lord said to him: &quot;Weare going to the country of the Cannibals.&quot;
Now Andrew did not perceive that it was Jesus, but our Lord concealed the might and power of His Godhead, and
appeared like a steersman. And Andrew
answered and said: &quot;We too wish to go to that city.&quot; Then our
Lord said to him: &quot;Every man flees from that city, and ye wish to go
thither!&quot; Andrew answered and said: &quot;We have something to do there,
and we must go thither; and now, if ye are going to do a kindness unto us, show
(it) to us.&quot; And Jesus answered and said to them: &quot;Come on board in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>And Andrew answered and said: &quot;I wish
thee to know, my brother, before we go on board the vessel, that we have no
ship-hire to give thee, nor have we bread for food with us.&quot; And our Lord
said to him: &quot;And how do ye come on board the vessel, when ye have no ship-hire? &quot; Andrew says to Him : &quot;Listen,
my brother; do not suppose that from stiff-neckedness we do not give
thee the ship-hire; but we are the disciples of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who
loved us, and chose us twelve, and gave us commandment and said: 'When ye go
forth to preach, do not take with you purses nor bags, nor copper (coin) in
your purses, nor bread, nor a staff, nor shoes; neither have ye two coats.' If
then thou wilt have compassion upon us, tell
us quickly; and if not, we will look
for another vessel.&quot; Jesus answered and said unto them: &quot;If
this be the commandment which ye have received, and ye keep it, come on board ;
for I say unto you, that it is more pleasing
to me that the disciples of the Messiah should come on board my vessel than
those who give me gold and silver. But this I say unto you, that perhaps
I am worthy that the disciple of the Messiah should come on board my
vessel.&quot; And Andrew answered and said: &quot;Permit me, my brother; may
the Lord give thee a reward and
pardon.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Andrew went on
board the vessel,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and answered and
said to his disciples: &quot;My children, if ye choose, stay on shore, until I finish what was commanded me by our Lord,
and return unto you.&quot; But his disciples said to him: &quot;Far be it from
us to do this! For if we remain behind thee, we shall become strangers to the
grace which was given us; and now we will be with thee whithersoever thou goest.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Jesus answered
and said to Andrew: &quot;If thou art in truth the disciple of the Messiah, remind
thy disciples of the miracles which thy Lord wrought, that thou mayest strengthen their
minds, that they may forget (their) concern about this sea; for lo, we are making
ready to loosen the vessel from the land and to sail.&quot; Then Jesus made a sign to one of the Angels, and he
loosened the vessel from the land; and Jesus came and sat in the midst of the vessel. And Andrew was encouraging his
disciples, and saying: &quot;My
children, ye have given up  your
lives for the Messiah; fear not; for He did not forsake us at the time when we were with Him in the vessel,
and He had lain down to sleep in the vessel, trying us, for He was not
asleep; and when there was a great wind, and the sea reared its waves so that
they rose above the mast of the vessel, and great fear took hold of us, our
Saviour arose and rebuked the wind, and the waves were assuaged, and there was a great calm on the sea; for
everything obeys His command, because they are His creation. And now,
my children, fear not.&quot; And when Andrew had said these things, he prayed
that his disciples-might remain at rest.</p>

<p>And when they had fallen asleep, Andrew
turned and said to Jesus, not knowing that it was Jesus: &quot;Tell me, man,
and truly show me this art of thy steering; for I have never seen a steersman
who managed a vessel as I now see thee.    For sixteen times have I sailed on
the sea, and this is the seventeenth, and I have never seen skill like this;
for verily this vessel is in the midst of the sea just as if it were on land.
Show me then thy art, O youth.&quot;    Then our Lord said to Andrew: &quot;We
too have sailed many times on the sea, and a violent storm has risen against
us; but because thou art the disciple of the Messiah, the sea has recognised thee
and has not uplifted its waves against us.&quot; Then Andrew cried with a loud
voice and said: &quot;I bless  Thy name, my Lord Jesus the Messiah, that Thou
hast let me meet with a man who glorifies Thy name.&quot; And Jesus answered
and said to him: &quot;Tell me, disciple of Jesus, why the wicked Jews did not
believe on thy Lord that He is the true God. Show me; for we have heard that
He  showed His power to His disciples.&quot; And Andrew answered and  said:
&quot;Yes,  my brother,  He showed us that He is the true God;  and now do not suppose that Jesus is not God, for He made man.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>&quot; 
And Jesus answered and said: &quot;And why did the Jews not believe on
Him?&quot; Andrew answered and said: &quot;O man, who hast the spirit of
knowledge and all understanding, why temptest thou me?&quot;    Our Lord says to him: &quot;I tempt thee not with
these things, but my soul rejoices and exults in them.&quot; Andrew says:
&quot;My brother, the Lord shall fill thy soul with great joy and grace.&quot;
Our Lord answered and said: &quot;Narrate to me then.&quot; And Andrew answered
and said:   &quot;Hast thou not heard of the miracles which He did before them?
To the blind He gave light, and to the lame to walk, and to the deaf and dumb
to hear and speak; and He cast out devils; the lepers He cleansed, the dead He
raised to life; He changed water into wine;  and He took five loaves and two fishes, and ordered the people to recline
upon the grass, and blessed, and satisfied them; and five thousand did eat and
were satisfied, and left (something) over.
And again He spake a blessing over
seven loaves, and satisfied four thousand. And He did many signs and
wonders and miracles, which,  if I narrate them before thee, thou wilt not be
able to bear.&quot; Jesus says to him: &quot;I shall be able; but to a  enough,
though a fool not even many (words) can
persuade.&quot;</p>

<p>And when our Lord knew that the vessel had
arrived near the land, He leaned His head against one of the Angels, and ceased to converse with Andrew. And when
Andrew saw (this), he leaned himself against his disciples, and sank into a
heavy sleep. And our Lord said to the Angels: &quot; Spread out your hands, and
carry Andrew and his disciples, and go,
place them at the gate of that city, the inhabitants of which eat the
flesh of men.&quot; And the Angels did as they were commanded, and took up Andrew and his disciples, and carried
(and) placed them at the gate of that city, the inhabitants of which eat
men.</p>

<p>And when Andrew awoke
from his sleep and opened his
eyes, he saw that he was sitting at the gate of that city, and his disciples beside him, who were asleep. And being astonished at what had happened, he awakened
them and said to them: &quot;Rise, my children, and see the grace that has been
with us, and know that our Lord was with us in the vessel, proving us, and we
did not recognise Him.&quot; And his disciples answered and said to him:
&quot;Do not suppose, our father,  that we knew that we were sailing on the
sea, because we were sunk in a deep sleep; and we saw that Angels came and took
our souls and carried them to Paradise; and we saw there great wonders, for we
saw our Lord Jesus the Messiah sitting on a glorious throne, and all the Angels
beholding Him; and we saw there Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Fathers
and the holy Prophets, and you too the twelve Apostles, standing beside our
Lord Jesus the Messiah; and we heard our Lord commanding His holy Angels: 'Be
obedient to the Apostles in everything which they say unto you.' This is the vision which we saw, our father.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the blessed Andrew, when he had heard
these things from his disciples, rejoiced
(with) a great joy, that his disciples were worthy to see the great
things of God. And he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said: &quot;Pardon me,
my Lord, and forgive me what I have done; for as a man I saw Thee in the
vessel, and as a man I spake with Thee. Wherein have I sinned, my Lord? (for)
Thou didst not show to me Thy majesty.&quot; And our Lord said unto him:
&quot;Thou hast not sinned, Andrew; but I did these things unto thee, because
thou saidst, 'I cannot go to the City of Dogs in three days.' Lo, now have I
shown thee that I am able to do everything by (my) power. But arise, and go
into the city unto Matthew thy brother, and bring him forth from prison, him
and all those who are imprisoned with him. And lo, I make known unto thee,
before thou enterest into their city, that they will show thee cruel tortures,
and thy body shall be torn, and thy blood shall be poured out upon the earth
like water; for death they cannot give unto thee, but great tortures they are
about to let pass over thee. But bear up, and harden not thyself against their
wickedness. Remember the tortures which I endured, when the Jews smote me with
their fists and spat in my face. Was I not able in the twinkling of an eye to
move heaven and earth, and to bring chastisement upon those who beat me? But I
bore (it), and forgave them, that I might set you an example.&quot;</p>

<p>And Andrew straightway arose, and entered
into that city with his disciples. And he went to the prison, and saw the seven
keepers, who were standing at the gates of the prison and guarding it. And
Andrew prayed, and these keepers fell down and died. And when he came nigh to
the gate of the prison, he made upon the gate the sign of the Cross; and
straightway the gate became open.</p>

<p>And when Andrew had entered the prison
with his disciples, Matthew saw Andrew, and
straightway he arose, and they asked after each other‘s welfare. And
Andrew said to Matthew: &quot;My brother, how hast thou got in here? For lo,
after three days, the men of this city are going to take thee out and kill thee
for their food. Where are the holy mysteries which thou hast learned? For if
thou didst utter them, heaven and earth would tremble.&quot; And Matthew
answered  and said: &quot;My brother Andrew, thou hast heard our Lord say: 'Lo,
I send you like lambs among wolves.' For as soon as I entered into this prison,
I prayed before the Lord, and He appeared unto me, saying: <i>'</i>Bear up for
twenty-seven days, and afterwards I will send unto thee Andrew, and he will
take thee out of this prison and also all those who are with thee.' And as our
Lord promised to me, lo, I see thee to-day ;
and now, what shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p>Then Andrew looked in the midst of the
prison, and saw those men who were bound there, stripped (naked) and eating
grass like cattle. And Andrew beat his breast and said: &quot;Our Lord Jesus
the Messiah, look and see what they have given to men, who are made in Thy
image and in Thy likeness, to eat.&quot; And the blessed (one) began to rebuke
Satan and to say: &quot;Out upon thee, Satan, thou enemy of our God and of His
Angels! How long wilt thou fight with the human race?&quot;</p>

<p>And Andrew and Matthew kneeled and prayed;
and afterwards Andrew laid his hands upon the eyes of those men who had been
blinded, and straightway they all saw the light. And again he placed his hand
upon their heart, and their understanding was changed and became like that of
men. And he said to them: &quot;Depart now to the lower part of the city. Lo,
ye shall find on the road a large fig-tree; sit down under it, and eat of its
fruit, till I come to you. And if I delay, ye will find for yourselves on it as
much food as sufficeth for you.&quot; And those men answered and said to the
blessed Andrew: &quot;Come with us, sir, lest perchance the heathen men of this
city see us again, and take us, and put us to tortures which are worse than the
former ones.&quot; And he said to them: &quot;Go in peace; verily I say unto
you, that, whilst ye are going, not even a dog shall bark at you.&quot;    And
those men went, as the blessed Andrew had said to them; and they were in number
forty-nine. But to Matthew he said that he should go with his disciples to the
east side of the city. And Andrew prayed, and a cloud descended, and took away
Matthew and his disciples, and set them on a mountain, where Peter the Apostle
was sitting and teaching; and they remained with
him.</p>

<p>But Andrew, after he had gone out of the
prison, was walking about in the city. And he saw a pillar, and upon it was
standing a statue of brass; and he sat down by the side of that pillar, that he
might see what would take place. And it happened that, when the executioners
went to the prison to fetch out men for their food, as was the custom of every
day, they found the gates of the prison open and the keepers dead and lying on
the ground. And they returned to the chief men, and said to them: &quot;We went
to the prison, and found it open and the keepers dead and lying on the ground; and when we went in, we found no man
there.&quot; And when the chief men heard (this), they said among
themselves: &quot;What is this thing that has happened? Have men perchance gone
into the prison and killed the keepers, and taken those who were bound there,
and departed?&quot; Then the chiefs said to the executioners: &quot;Go to the
prison, and bring those seven keepers, that we may eat them to day; and
straightway collect for us all the old men of the city, and let them cast lots
among themselves, and those on whom the lot falls we shall go on killing every
day, seven by seven, for our food, until we choose young men and put them on
board ship, and they go to the countries around us, and put men on board their
ships and bring (them) hither, that they may be
to us for food.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the executioners had gone to the
prison, they brought those seven keepers dead. And there was there a large
furnace, which was built in the midst of the city; and by the side of the
furnace there was a large trough of stone, in which they used to kill the men,
and their blood ran down and was collected in that trough, and they used to
draw up the blood and drink it. And it happened that, when they had brought those seven, who were dead, they placed them
beside the trough, that they might lay their hands upon them and lift them up. And the blessed Andrew heard a voice
saying to him: &quot;Andrew, look and see what is being done in this
city.&quot; And it happened that, when he saw (it), he prayed and said:
&quot;Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who hast
brought me to this city, do not permit that there take place in it
anything hateful, but let the knives fall from the hands of these executioners.&quot; And straightway their hands were
paralysed, and they were not able to lift them up or let them down. And
when the nobles saw what had happened, they wept bitterly, saying: &quot;Woe
unto us, for there are magicians here, and
they have gone into the prison, and slain the keepers, and brought out
those who were imprisoned there; and lo,
they have bewitched the executioners too. What then shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p>Then they said to the executioners:
&quot;Go, collect for us the old men of the city, because we are hungry.&quot;
And they went and collected them, and found two hundred and sixteen in number,
and brought them to their nobles; and they commanded them to cast lots, and the
lot of seven old men came forth. And one of the old men, upon whom the lot had
fallen, answered and said to the executioners: &quot;I beg of you, I have a little
son, take him and kill him in my stead, and let me go.&quot; And they said to
him  &quot;We cannot do this, unless the nobles bid us.&quot; And the
executioners went and told their nobles these things. And the nobles answered
and said to them: &quot;If he gives a substitute, let him go&quot;; and the
executioners made this known to the old man. And the old man answered and said
to them : &quot;I have a daughter too ; take her also with her brother for
slaughter, and let me go.&quot; And he gave them up for slaughter, and the
executioners took these children to kill them. And they were weeping and
saying: &quot;Do not kill us in this youth (of ours), but allow us to come to
full growth, and then ye may kill (us).&quot; And this also was the custom in
that city, that they did not bury those who died, but ate them. And the
executioners did not heed these children, but took them and went to the trough,
in which they used to kill men, to kill them.&quot;                                                                   </p>

<p>And when the holy Andrew saw (this), he
wept bitterly, and said: &quot;Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, as Thou didst hear
me sinful concerning these dead, and Thy Divinity did not suffer them to be
eaten, so now too do not suffer them to be brought nigh to the death of these
children, but let their hands be paralysed, and let the knives fall and melt
like wax before the fire.&quot; And the moment that the blessed Andrew had
prayed, the knives were loosened, and fell from the hands of the executioners.
And when S. Andrew saw what had happened, he glorified God who had answered him
in everything. </p>

<p>And when the rulers saw what had happened,
they wept bitterly and said: &quot;Woe unto us! what is there now for us to
do?&quot; And Satan took the likeness of an old man, and stood in their midst,
and said: &quot;Woe to you! What can ye do? For ye have no food. And now arise,
and seize in this city a stranger, whose name is Andrew, and kill him; for he
has let out these men who were shut up in
the prison.&quot;   </p>

<p>And S. Andrew looked upon Satan, how he
was talking among the crowd; but Satan did not see the blessed (one). And the Apostle of the Messiah answered and said
to Satan:&quot;O thou enemy
of all mankind, who art constantly warring against them, our Lord Jesus the
Messiah will humble thee and cast thee into the deep abyss of
destruction.&quot; And when Satan heard this, he said, &quot;Fie, fie upon
thee! Thy voice I hear, but where thou art I know not.&quot; And the blessed
(one) answered and said to Satan: &quot;Verily thou art blind, and thou canst
not «m see the saints.&quot; And when Satan heard this, he said to the
multitude: &quot;See now, seize him with whom I am speaking, because he is the
disturber of your affairs.&quot; And those wicked (ones) ran and shut the
gates of the city; and they were going about and seeking for the blessed Andrew
through the whole city, and did not see him. Then our Lord Jesus the Messiah
appeared to him and said to him: &quot;Andrew, arise, show them thy power, that
they may learn that the power of Satan, who dwells in them, is nought.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the blessed Andrew arose in the sight
of the whole multitude, and said: &quot;I am Andrew, whom ye seek.&quot; Then
the whole people ran and seized him, and said to him: &quot;As thou hast done
unto us, we will do unto thee.&quot; And they began taking counsel together and
saying: &quot; With what death shall we kill him? If indeed we take off his
head, it is not a bitter death; and if we burn him with fire, neither is this
anything.&quot; Then one of them, after Satan had entered into him, answered
and said to them: &quot;As he made us suffer, so we too will make him suffer.
This let us do unto him. Let us put ropes round his neck, and drag him through
the streets and lanes of this city; and when he is dead, then we will divide
his body among all of us.&quot; And this seemed good before the whole people;
and they cast ropes upon his neck, and were dragging him through all the
streets and lanes of the city, until his body was torn by the stones over which
he was dragged, and his blood was flowing like water. And when it was evening,
they cast him into prison, with his hands
bound behind him.          </p>

<p>And again, when it was morning, they
brought him out, and cast cords upon his neck, and dragged him through the
whole city, and his whole body was torn by the ground. And the blessed (one)
prayed with sighs and said: &quot;Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, behold what they
do with me, and I bear it because of Thy command, —for if it were not because of Thy mercy, Thou wouldest have sent
them into the deep abyss, with their city,—but only, Lord, do not permit the enemy to mock me.&quot; And when
the blessed (one) had said these things, Satan answered from behind him and
said to the people: &quot;Be smiting him upon his mouth, that he may not
speak.&quot;</p>

<p>And when evening came, they cast him into
the prison. Then Satan took with him seven
demons, and went into the prison. And they stood before S. Andrew, and
were mocking him, saying: &quot; Now art thou caught in our hands. Who then
shall deliver thee? For lo, thou destroyest our works out of every city, and
hast desolated our temples and shrines, which were built for us.&quot; And
Satan commanded those seven demons which were with him to slay the blessed (one).
Then, when these demons drew near, and saw the seal of the Messiah between his eyes, they were afraid and
fled from him. And Satan answered and said to them: &quot;Why flee ye
from him? &quot;What is it?&quot; And
they say to him: &quot;We cannot come near to him because of the seal which is
upon him; but do thou go, slay him, if thou art able.&quot; And Satan said to
them: &quot;Come then, let us mock him.&quot; Then those demons came with Satan
their master, and were mocking the blessed (one) and saying: &quot;Thou O Andrew,
lo, art come to great disgrace and to hard judgement.&quot; Then, when the
blessed Andrew heard these things, he said: &quot;If ye kill me outright, I
will not do your pleasure, but the pleasure of my Lord; for if my Lord visits
me in this city, I will chastise you as ye deserve.&quot; And when the demons
heard these things, they vanished from
before him like smoke.</p>

<p>And when it was morning, they brought the
blessed Andrew out of the prison, and tied ropes round his neck, and were
dragging him. And again his body (was lacerated) and all the hair of his head
was pulled out. And the blessed (one) cried with a loud voice, with sighs and
tears, and said: &quot;Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, these tortures are enough
for me, these three days, by day and by night, of Satan and of the demons and
of these heathens. Command, Lord, and
receive my spirit, or show me Thy grace that I may be
strengthened.&quot; And when he had said these things, a voice came to him in
Hebrew, saying: &quot;Andrew, heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words
shall not pass away.And do thou now turn and see thy flesh, which
has been plucked from thee, what has become of it.&quot; And he looked and saw large trees, which had grown up and
bore fruit. And S. Andrew said: &quot;Now, Lord, I know that Thou hast not forsaken me.&quot;</p>

<p>And when it was evening, they cast him
into the prison, saying: &quot;His body is destroyed, and during this night he
will die.&quot; Then our Lord Jesus the Messiah appeared to him in the prison, and said to him: &quot;Andrew, give
me thy hand.&quot; And He took him by his hand, and straightway he rose up whole. And the blessed (one) fell down and
worshipped Him. And afterwards he looked into the midst of the pit in which he
was imprisoned, and saw a pillar (statue) which was called in Greek Alabastros.
And Andrew stretched out his hand and said: &quot;Thou dumb stone, fear the
sign of the Cross, at which heaven and earth tremble; and straightway let there
flow from thy mouth much water, that it may submerge this city.&quot; And
straightway that pillar (statue) let much water flow out like a mighty stream;
and the water prevailed exceedingly, and killed their children and their
cattle; and they were wishing' to flee from the city.</p>

<p>Then the blessed Andrew prayed, and a
fiery cloud descended,  and surrounded the city like a wall, and they were
unable to flee. And when Andrew knew what had happened, he glorified God and
said: &quot;I bless Thee, our Lord Jesus the Messiah!&quot; And all the inhabitants of the city trembled, and were weeping and
saying: &quot;Woe to us I for all these things have come upon us because
of the stranger who is in the prison; but let us go and release him, that we
may not die wretchedly by these waters of
the flood and by this fire.&quot;</p>

<p>And they all came to the prison, crying
out with a mournful voice. And when the blessed Andrew saw that their spirit
was humbled to him, he said to the pillar (statue): &quot;Enough now; do not
emit water any more. Lo, I will go out and preach the word of God; and I say
unto thee, that, if the people of this city believe, I will build in it a
church, and I will remove thee hence, and convey thee and set thee up in it, in
recompense for thy having answered me and done that which was commanded thee.&quot; And at that moment the
statue ceased from its flowing. And Andrew went forth from the prison, and the
water was running before his feet.</p>

<p>Then the old man, who had given up his
children to slaughter in his stead, came
nigh before him, and said to him: &quot;Have mercy upon us, our
lord.&quot; And Andrew answered and said to him: &quot;I ask of thee, how canst
thou say to me that I should have mercy upon thee, when thou didst not have mercy upon thy children. But I say unto
thee, that in a little while these waters shall go and be swallowed up in the
midst of the abyss, and these executioners, who were killing the men, and thou
too shalt be swallowed up with them.&quot; And he turned and said to the
assembly: &quot;Come after me, all of you.&quot; And whilst they were going
after him, the waters were divided hither and thither before the feet of the
holy (one), until he came to the place of the trough. And the blessed Andrew
lifted up his face to heaven, and prayed,
and the earth opened, and swallowed up
the water and the executioners and the old man. And when the people of the city saw what had happened,
they began to say among themselves: &quot;Woe to us! for this man has
been sent hither by God, and he will kill us because of the tortures which we
made him bear; for lo, as it has been with the executioners and with that old
man, (so) it will be with us.&quot; And the blessed Andrew, when he heard
(this), said to them: &quot;Fear not, my children, for not even these will God
leave in Sheol; these have been snatched away to the lower earth, that ye might
believe.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Andrew ordered them to bring all
those who had been drowned by the water; and they were not able to bring them,
because those who had died by the water were many, men and women, and children
and animals. Then the blessed (one) prayed
before God, and they were resuscitated and all arose. And after these
things he baptised them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit of
holiness. And he marked out for them the likeness of a church, and it was built
quickly. And they brought the pillar (statue) which had made the water flow,
and set it up in the church. And he sketched out for them rules and laws by
which they might subsist, and delivered to them the mysteries of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and bade them sow
and be nourished by the sweat of their faces. And he made haste to
depart from them; and they were beseeching him, from the youngest to the
oldest, and were saying to him: &quot;We beg of thee, tarry with us a few days,
(for) we are yet children in the faith, that we may receive of thy blessed
fountain and of thy divine words.&quot; But he did not consent to abide with
them, but went his way.</p>

<p>Then our Lord assumed unto him the
likeness of a comely child, and said to him: &quot;Why art thou going, and
leaving them without fruit, and not taking pity upon the children who are
coming after thee and crying out? Now therefore return to the city, and abide
with them seven days; and when thou enterest into the city, bring up those who
were swallowed up in the abyss.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Andrew glorified God and said:
&quot;Blessed art Thou, our Lord Jesus the
Messiah, for Thou dost not wish that a man should perish, but that he
should live.&quot; And he returned, and entered into the city.    And when the
people of the city saw that he had returned, they rejoiced (with) a great joy. And he spent there seven days,
teaching and confirming them in the faith of our Lord. Then the blessed
Andrew prayed, and the men, who had been
swallowed up in the abyss, were resuscitated. And after seven days all
the people of the city went out, and were accompanying him on his way, from the
youngest even to the oldest, and were crying out and saying: &quot;One is the God of the blessed Andrew, our Lord Jesus
the Messiah, the Son of the living God;&quot; to whom is befitting glory and
worship and thanksgiving, with His blessed Father and His living and holy
Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. </p>
