<p align="center"><b>What's New?</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">This page is simply to indicate when new material is added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>31/01/2004</b> : Works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite
added</p>

<p align="left"><b>26/01/2004</b> : The Legend of Hilaria added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>23/01/2004</b> : The Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles from the
Syriac added.&nbsp; My thanks to Colin Tunnicliffe, who scanned a copy of this
work and sent me both the bitmaps and the OCR'd and proofed text. Note that a
complete reprint of this book with all notes, page divisions and Syriac text can
be bought online by visiting <a href="http://www.gorgiaspress.com/">Gorgias Press</a>,&nbsp;
(and search on <i>Wright</i>).</p>

<p align="left"><b>15/01/2004</b> : Apology of Aristides completed.</p>

<p align="left"><b>24/12/2003</b> : Lausiac History added.&nbsp; Started to add
the letters of Ambrose of Milan.&nbsp; The Syriac version of Aristides is
halted, as I am missing pages 9-10 of this.&nbsp; I will finish it when I can
get to the library again.</p>

<p align="left"><b>06/12/2003</b> : Sermons of Asterius of Amasea added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>21/11/2003</b> : Philoxenus completed.&nbsp; Syriac material
omitted, however, as entering it manually is beyond my skill and available time.&nbsp;
Aristides added.&nbsp; I know this should be in the ANF online, but the fact is
that the translation itself is missing.</p>

<p align="left"><b>07/11/2003</b> : Started to add the 13 Ascetic Discourses of
Philoxenus of Hierapolis.&nbsp; Strangely enough, this book was ordered at the
same time as Vaschalde, but took weeks longer to arrive.</p>

<p align="left"><b>16/10/2003</b> : A.A.Vaschalde's version of Three Letters by
Philoxenus of Hierapolis (Mabbug) placed online, minus the Syriac text.&nbsp;
There seems to be only one copy of this in the UK, which makes it a rare volume.</p>

<p align="left"><b>04/10/2003</b> : Formatting revised on all pages to make font
sizes appear the same in Netscape as in IE.</p>

<p align="left"><b>26/09/2003</b> : Added the Chronicle of Edessa.</p>

<p align="left"><b>19/09/2003</b> : Irenaeus, Proof of the Apostolic Preaching
added.&nbsp; HTML &lt;A NAME=&gt; anchors added on the index page for each
author and work.&nbsp; Navigation buttons added for Cosmas Indicopleustes.</p>

<p align="left"><b>15/09/2003</b> : Gildas, The Ruin of Britain added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>08/09/2003</b> : Origen, Philocalia added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>06/09/2003</b> : Added the fragments to Nepos, and wrote an
introduction for it.</p>

<p align="left"><b>30/08/2003</b> : Also added the introduction to the Festal
Letters of Athanasius by William Cureton, containing more information about the
find at the Nitrian desert.</p>

<p align="left"><b>29/08/2003</b> : The remaining letters of Severus of Antioch
added: 62-118.&nbsp; I know that there is another collection of letters by S.,
but don't have these.&nbsp; Scanning S. has been such a pain, that I am in no
hurry to volunteer for more.&nbsp; The pain is caused by each page having Syriac
and English and loads of boring footnotes.&nbsp; They're hard to photocopy -- it
is physically exhausting to lift the massive folio volumes of the Patrologia
Orientalis up and down, up and
down on the photocopier -- hard to scan, hard to recognise, hard to proof and
interminable to format.&nbsp; I don't want any more at the moment.</p>

<p align="left">I've added a rare article from the <a href="nitrian_mss_quarterly_review.html">Quarterly
Review of 1845-6</a>, containing eyewitness accounts of how the Syriac
manuscripts in the British Museum were obtained from the Nitrian Desert
monasteries of Egypt.&nbsp; These manuscripts are the basis of several of the
translations on this site, and the existence of the article seems to have been
forgotten.</p>

<p align="left"><b>23/08/2003</b> : Cornelius Nepos added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>20/08/2003</b> : Zosimus revised against an original copy --
lacuna in book 4 filled.</p>

<p align="left"><b>16/08/2003</b> : My thanks to David Camden for reporting a
bunch of typos in the later portions of Justin.&nbsp; Error reports are always
very welcome!</p>

<p align="left"><b>04/08/2003</b> : Eusebius PE completed.&nbsp; Justin, Epitome
of Pompeius Trogus added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>09/07/2003</b> : Cosmas Indicopleustes, and Spicilegium
Syriacum added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>27/06/2003</b> : Still working on Eusebius, PE.</p>

<p align="left"><b>02/05/2003</b> : Peter Kirby has prompted me to do some of
Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, which we've both been looking at without
enthusiasm for a couple of years.&nbsp; He's done a simplified version of the
intro and book 1 -- in response I've done the same for books 3 and 5.&nbsp; The
layout of the original is a pig, which is why we haven't got started for so
long.</p>

<p align="left"><b>31/05/2003</b> : Cosmas book 3 added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>24/05/2003</b> : Cosmas book 2 added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>10/05/2003</b> : Started to add Cosmas Indicopleustes.&nbsp;
I really haven't the time at the moment, but this scans so easily that it can be
done at the end of the day when I'm too tired to do much else.&nbsp; However it may take
a while!</p>

<p align="left"><b>11/04/2003</b> : <a href="syriac_misc.html">Syriac
Miscellanies</a> added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>29/03/2003</b> : Typos corrected in <a href="gregory_nazianzen_5_bohn_catalogue.html">Bohn's
catalogue</a>.&nbsp; <a href="hermias_0_epreface.html">Preface</a> added to
Hermias.</p>

<p align="left"><b>28/03/2003</b> : Eutropius added.</p>

<p align="left">[Mirrors updated]</p>

<p align="left"><b>08/03/2003</b> : &quot;Julian the Emperor&quot; scanned; two
invectives by Gregory Nazianzen, plus Libanius' Monody and two orations by
Julian.</p>

<p align="left"><b>07/03/2003</b> : Introduction revised.</p>

<p align="left"><b>05/03/2003</b> : Hermias' Satire added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>27/02/2003</b> : First 61 letters of Severus of Antioch
added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>26/02/2003</b> : Doctrine of Addai added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>25/02/2003</b> : Apocrypha from Mt. Sinai has begun to be
added, thanks to Renardo68 who sent in a scanned text.</p>

<p align="left"><b>14/02/2003</b> : Dionysius of Alexandria, Letters, was not
listed on the index.htm - fixed.&nbsp; The sermon on the Star falsely attributed
to Eusebius of Caesarea added.</p>

<p align="left">[Mirrors contain material below this point]</p>

<p align="left"><b>24/01/2003</b> : Sidonius completed.&nbsp; I wish there were
a PD version of his Poems also, but I don't think there is.</p>

<p align="left"><b>23/01/2003</b> : Gregory of Nyssa, Life of St. Macrina, now
online.&nbsp; I'll get back to finishing the introduction to Sidonius in the
next few days, and when that is done notify the mirror sites (all updates since
3/1 need to be mirrored).</p>

<p align="left"><b>22/01/2003</b> : Sidonius Apollinaris' letters are now
online.&nbsp; The notes I have left at the end of volume 2, as when I tried
placing them after each letter, it made the page look untidy.&nbsp; The introduction
is still to scan -- some 200 pages of it.</p>

<p align="left"><b>20/01/2003</b> : Began scanning the letters of Sidonius
Apollinaris.&nbsp; The footnotes for these are at the rear of volume 2, so I
will return and add these after each letter when I've scanned the relevant
pages.</p>

<p align="left"><b>08/01/2003</b> : Typos corrected in the introduction to <a href="zosimus00_intro.html">Zosimus</a>,
and to <a href="eunomius_apology00_intro.html">Eunomius</a>.</p>

<p align="left"><b>06/01/2003</b> : Link corrected in the <a href="macarius_apocriticus.html">Apocriticus</a>.&nbsp;
Misssing <a href="ephesus_0_toc.html">TOC for John of Ephesus </a>fixed.&nbsp;
Thanks to John Burton for spotting these!</p>

<p align="left"><b>03/01/2003</b> : Eusebius, Demonstratio Evangelica, now
added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>30/12/2002</b> : John of Ephesus, books 4, 5 and 6 added.&nbsp;
Now complete (since I omit the index).</p>

<p align="left"><b>27/12/2002</b> : John of Ephesus, book 3 added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>24/12/2002</b> : Added Basil the Great, Address to young men
on the right use of Greek literature.&nbsp; Eunomius, the First Apology, added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>21/12/2002</b> : Began adding John of Ephesus.&nbsp; 2&nbsp;
books (of 6) done so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>23/11/2002</b> : I've started adding the Syriac Chronicle
sometimes attributed to Zachariah of Mitylene (Zacharias Rhetor).&nbsp; 6 books
done.</p>

<p align="left"><b>19/11/2002</b> : The New History of Zosimus added as an
appendix.</p>

<p align="left"><b>26/10/2002</b> : The Chronicle of John of Nikiu added.&nbsp; Added Mss. details to Evagrius Scholasticus <a href="evagrius_0_intro2.html">intro</a>.</p>

<p align="left"><b>25/10/2002</b> : Antiochus Strategos, <a href="antiochus_strategos_capture.html">The
Sack of Jerusalem by the Persians in 614AD</a> added.&nbsp; <a href="dionysius_alexandria_letters.html">Newly
discovered Letters of Dionysius of Alexandria to Popes Stephen and Xystus</a>
added.</p>

<p align="left"><b>19/10/2002</b> : Evagrius Scholasticus - all the text added,
just table of contents and indexes to do.</p>

<p align="left"><b>02/10/2002</b> : Ephraim, <a href="ephraim1_5_hypatius5.html">Discourse
to Hypatius Book 5</a> added.&nbsp; And that's the lot!</p>

<p align="left"><b>01/10/2002</b> : Ephraim, <a href="ephraim1_4_hypatius4.html">Discourse
to Hypatius Book 4</a> added.&nbsp; Book 3 has also been done, of course.</p>

<p align="left"><b>27/09/2002</b> : Ephraim, <a href="ephraim1_2_hypatius2.html">Hypatius
Book 2</a> added.&nbsp; The Hypatius material is very painful to transcribe
because of the marginal material, so please bear with me.</p>

<p align="left"><b>10/09/2002</b> : St. Ephraim's Prose Refutations started -
the <a href="ephraim2_1_bardesan.html">Discourse against Bardaisan's
&quot;Domnus&quot;</a> added.</p>
