<p align="center"><b>Hermias: Satire on pagan philosophers -- preface to the
online edition&nbsp;</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">Very little is known about this obscure little work in Greek,
the <i>Irrisio Gentilium Philosophorum</i>.&nbsp; The author is styled 'Hermias
the philosopher' in his own work, but cannot be identified with any other figure
of antiquity.&nbsp; The date at which he wrote is uncertain.&nbsp; His work
contains no allusions by which to date it, and is not explicitly cited by any
other writer in antiquity.&nbsp; A number of parallels have been seen in works
from Tatian onwards, from the 2nd to the 6th centuries AD.&nbsp; But none is
compelling, and in any case each parallel can mean either that Hermias used that
work, or equally that the other author knew Hermias.</p>

<p align="left">Biblical citations are few.&nbsp; The work opens with a
quotation from 1 Corinthians 3:19.&nbsp; The only other reference is in chapter
17:12-20, where the discussion is based closely on Isiah 40:12 in the Septuagint
version.</p>

<p align="left">The best manuscript is the codex Patmiacus 202, belonging to the
library of the monastery of St. John, Patmos.&nbsp; It is a parchment Ms. of the
11th-12th centuries, and became known to scholars only in 1890 when Sakkelion
published a catalogue of that library.&nbsp; Harnack then signalled some of the
variants in 1893.&nbsp; 15 others exist, all later.&nbsp; These belong to a
different and inferior family, but which still has a role to play.&nbsp; Three
of the later ones were copied by a notorious copyist, Andreas Damarios, who made
around 7-8 errors in each copy he made.&nbsp; The work was first printed in 1553
by Ralph Seiler.</p>

<p align="left">The first edition to make full use of the Patmiacus is that by a
group of English scholars led by the late R.P.C. Hanson.&nbsp; This does not
seem to have been published in English: a French translation appeared&nbsp; in
1993 in the Sources Chrétiennes series.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contains a very full
discussion of all the issues surrounding this work, and tentatively concludes
that Hermias is most safely dated to around 200 AD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The only English translation is that by J.A. Giles, which
appears here.&nbsp; For some reason this work was not included in the
Ante-Nicene Fathers, and has not been included in any other collection of the
second century writers.</p>
