<p align="center"><b>Asterius of Amasea, Sermons (1904). Preface to the online
edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>While browsing through my copy of J. Quasten's &quot;Patrology&quot; (vol.3,
p.300) about a year ago, I became aware that a translation existed of five
sermons by the 4th century Cappadocian father, Asterius, Bishop of Amasea (not
to be confused with the Arian polemicist, Asterius the Sophist).&nbsp; Published
in 1904 in the US as &quot;Ancient Sermons for Modern Times,&quot; it is the
only portion of his works to exist in English.</p>
<p>He was a contemporary of Amphilochius and the three great Cappadocian
fathers.&nbsp; Little is known about his life.&nbsp; Like Amphilochius, he had
been a&nbsp; lawyer before becoming bishop between 380 and 390 AD.&nbsp; Sixteen
homilies and panegyrics on the martyrs are extant, which show his training in
rhetoric and familiarity with the classics.&nbsp; One of them, <i><a href="asterius_04_sermon4.html">Oratio
4: Adversus Kalendarum Festum</a></i> (#4 in our collection) attacks the pagan
customs and abuses of the New Year feast, denying everything that Libanius had
said in its favour.&nbsp; It was preached on the 1st January, 400 AD.&nbsp; <i>Oration
11, On the martyrdom of St. Euphemia</i>, is important for the history of art,
as in it Asterius describes a painting of the martyrdom and compares it to
pictures by Euphranor and Timomachus.&nbsp; The text is quoted twice by the
second council of Nicaea in 787 as evidence in favour of the veneration of
images.</p>
<p>More sermons existed in the time of Photius, who refers to a further 10
sermons not now known in <i>Bibliotheca</i> codex 271.&nbsp; One of these lost
sermons told him that Asterius lived to a great age.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourteen genuine sermons are printed by Migne in the <i>Patrologia Graeca</i>
40, 155-480, with Latin translation.&nbsp; (Others printed there are by Asterius
the Sophist).&nbsp; A further two genuine sermons were discovered in manuscripts
at Mt. Athos by M. Bauer, and first printed by A. Bretz (TU 40.1, 1914).&nbsp;
Eleven sermons have been translated into German.</p>
<p>Physical copies of &quot;Ancient Sermons for Modern Times&quot; are
rare.&nbsp; The only copy in the United Kingdom is in the British Library, whose
policies mean that photocopies cannot be had.&nbsp; Libraries in the United
States sometimes have copies of a micro-fiche version made by ATLA.&nbsp; But a
copy exists in the library of Harvard University.&nbsp; A kind lady from the
area, who wishes to remain anonymous, wrote to me about my website.&nbsp; I
somewhat tentatively asked if a photocopy might be obtained.&nbsp; She very
kindly sent me one, so that the text might be available to all online.&nbsp; I
am delighted to have this opportunity to express my thanks.</p>
