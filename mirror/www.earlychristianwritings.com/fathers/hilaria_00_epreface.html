<p align="center"><b>The Legend of Hilaria (1913). Preface to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>As Christianity took hold in the Roman empire, it affected every area of
life.&nbsp; In particular, folklore also began to take on a Christianised form,
being remade into a new version acceptable to a culture in which Christianity
was very fashionable. Everyone knew the gospel narratives, and looked to see God
at work actively in their current lives, and hungered for accounts of Him doing
so.&nbsp; Such expectations were not likely to be disappointed.&nbsp; Stories of
miraculous activity promptly came into being.</p>

<p>It would be harsh and anachronistic to regard such stories as forgeries or
fakes.&nbsp; Rather, these were the urban legends of their day, reflecting the
hopes and aspirations (and fears!) of the society in which they arose.&nbsp;
Small events became larger, and more decorated.</p>

<p>Finally, as the distance between history and hagiography became larger, under
pressure from these expectations, the gap from hagiography to folkstory narrowed
to vanishing point.&nbsp; Much older folk-stories were reworked as amusing or
inspirational fiction.&nbsp; The legend of Hilaria is one of these.&nbsp; The
basic story is ancient Egyptian -- the Story of Bent-Resh -- but has long since
gone into the melting-pot of popular culture.&nbsp; What emerges may
legitimately be called 'pious fiction' -- a much abused term, most properly
applied to fictional literature for those who wish they saw more miracles than
they do.</p>

<p>A series of versions of the story exist, and are translated here.&nbsp; None
have any claim to historical reality, any more than the ballads of Robin
Hood.&nbsp; But they have great value in helping us to understand the dreams and
aspirations of the society that produced them and treasured them.</p>
