(1814). Introduction to the online edition.</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">The presence of the 'New History' of Zosimus in a collection of
the fathers requires some explanation.&nbsp; Zosimus was not one of the fathers,
nor indeed a Christian.&nbsp; He was a bigoted pagan, who wrote in order to
smear the Christians, and to abuse the founders of the Christian empire,
Constantine and Theodosius.&nbsp; He was not even a contemporary of the events,
writing around 500 AD.&nbsp; Nor is he unwilling to adjust the facts to fit his
thesis that abandoning the sacrifices of paganism was the cause of the collapse
of the empire.&nbsp; For instance he moves the conversion of Constantine to 326,
so that Constantine's military successes can be assigned to a 'pagan' period,
and thus must omit all mention of the Council of Nicaea in 325, or the
legislation dating from 313 onwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Because of his anti-Christian stance, some writers have been
ready to treat him as the only objective witness to the period.&nbsp; While this
is absurd, nevertheless his statements are of interest as reflecting a very
different point of view from our other sources, the ecclesiastical
historians.&nbsp; The adjustments that he or his source makes to the facts are
not outside the legitimate bounds of history as it was understood in classical
times, and his sources are now mostly lost.&nbsp; As such, his work is valuable.</p>

<p align="left">The public domain translation is very difficult for ordinary
readers to obtain.&nbsp; In view of the interest of the text, I have therefore
decided to include it in this collection, albeit as an appendix.</p>

<h3 align="left">About Zosimus</h3>

<p align="left">All of our information derives from the Bibliotheca of Photius
(elsewhere in this collection).&nbsp; Codex 98 is our text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <P>98.&nbsp; Read the <I>History </I>of count Zosimus, ex-advocate of the fisc, in six books. Being an impious heathen, he frequently yelps at those of the true faith. His style is concise, clear, and pure, and not devoid of charm. He begins his history almost from the time of Augustus, and glances rapidly at the emperors down to Diocletian, merely mentioning their proclamation and the order of succession. From Diocletian he treats at greater length of his successors in five books. The first book contains the emperors from Augustus to Diocletian and the sixth book ends at the time when Alaric, who was besieging Rome for the second time, when the citizens were reduced to desperate straits, raised the siege and proclaimed Attalus emperor. Soon afterwards he deposed him because of his incapacity, and sent an embassy to Honorius, who was then at Ravenna, with proposals for peace. But Sarus, himself a Goth and an enemy of Alaric, with about 300 men attached himself to Honorius, and, promising to do his utmost to assist him against Alaric, succeeded in making the negotiations unsuccessful. Here the sixth book ends.
</P>
  <P>
It may be said that Zosimus did not himself write the history, but that he copied that of Eunapius, from which it only differs in brevity and in being less abusive of Stilicho. In other respects his account is much the same, especially in the attacks upon the Christian emperors. I think that both these authors brought out new editions, although I have not seen the first edition, but it may be conjectured from the title of the &quot;new edition,&quot; which I have read, that, like Eunapius, he published a second edition. He is clearer and more concise, as we have said, than Eunapius, and rarely employs figures of speech.

</blockquote>

<p align="left">The 'fisc' is the imperial treasury.&nbsp; Photius draws
attention to the title, <i>Nea Historia</i>, which he presumes indicates a new
edition.&nbsp; However this is not generally accepted today.</p>

<p align="left">There had been much legislation to prevent pagans holding office
from the fourth century onwards.&nbsp; Neverthless pagans continued to do
so.&nbsp; Others in the late fifth century include the jurist Demochares,
Pamprepius (consul ca. 479 and magister officiorum to Leontius, RE 18.3.409),
and Severus who was consul in 470.</p>

<p align="left">It is thought that Zosimus used Dexippus for book 1, Eunapius
for books 2-5.27, and Olympiodorus thereafter.&nbsp; The history of the latter
went down to 425.&nbsp; All these are entirely or mostly lost, but Zosimus
copied them slavishly.&nbsp; This can be seen in book 5 where the presentation
of Stilicho is hostile while he follows Eunapius, and then becomes mildly
positive in 5.34 when he is following Olympiodorus.</p>

<p align="left">Zosimus refers to the hated tax, the Chryargyrum (2.38.4),
abolished by Anastasius I in 498, in terms that suggest strongly that he lived
after that date.&nbsp; Evagrius Scholasticus (elsewhere in this collection)
writing at the end of the 6th century attacks Zosimus, and tells us that
Eustathius, who died around 518,&nbsp; also wrote against him.&nbsp; This allows
us to date Zosimus to the early 6th century.</p>

<h3 align="left">About the manuscripts and editions</h3>

<p align="left">The text of Zosimus survives in a single manuscript now in the
Vatican, Codex Vaticanus Graecus 156.&nbsp; This was written over a period of
two centuries, the 10th-12th, probably in the celebrated and scholarly Studios
monastery in Constantinople.&nbsp; However the manuscript has suffered
damage.&nbsp; A quaternion of 8 leaves is missing at the end of book 1 / start
of book 2.&nbsp; Also a single leaf has been cut out in book 5, ch. 22.&nbsp;
The Ms. was in the Vatican in 1475, but was moved to the closed shelves during
the wars of religion in 1572.&nbsp; It was made available again in the
1850s.&nbsp; A surreptitous copy was made in the 16th century, however, and from
copies of this all the texts until 1887 were derived.</p>

<h3 align="left">About this translation</h3>

<p align="left">This text is a copy of the 1814 English translation, which
implies that it is a fresh translation with the notes of the 1679 Oxford
edition.&nbsp; But since there is a 1684 translation which claims the same,
certain points lead me to believe that it is a very careless reprint only.&nbsp;
No translator's name or introduction is present.&nbsp; The printed book is littered
with crass mistakes which could not have occurred had it been proof-read at all.
The pagination runs up to p.125, then reverts to 124 and on. The pagination has been tampered
again with between pp.
134-137 to add two to the count, so that the final number is correct.&nbsp; Finally
the book is padded out with 70 pages of really irrelevant appendices, plainly
there only to increase the price.&nbsp; These last have been omitted. The title page indicates that it was printed by W. Green and T.
Chaplin for Mr. J. Davis, who presumably paid for this inferior product.</p>

<p align="left">An original copy of this edition was not available to me in
November 2002.&nbsp; This online text was originally prepared from a poor quality photocopy of the volume, bound as a book with the pages
reversed.&nbsp; It has been very hard to scan.&nbsp; Reports of typographical errors
which may have escaped me are very welcome.&nbsp; The copy omitted the 'second'
pages 124-5 in book IV, leaving a lacuna.&nbsp; In August 2003 I was able to
consult an original in the Taylorian Institute Annex of the Bodleian Library in
Oxford, and used this to complete the edition.</p>

<p align="left"> Two cases where the wrong name has plainly been inserted
by the compositor -- Jovian for Julian, Constantine for Constantius -- I have
corrected.&nbsp; I have no doubt there are others.&nbsp; It has been a
considerable temptation to correct the typographical errors, but I have
refrained from doing so.</p>

<p align="left">As usual, copying and placing copies online is encouraged.&nbsp;</p>

Zosimus is replete and a very valuable source), and a 'commentary' which is
virtually non-existent.&quot;<br>
