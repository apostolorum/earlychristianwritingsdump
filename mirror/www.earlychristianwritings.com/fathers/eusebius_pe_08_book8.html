<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>IN the preceding Book, I have traced the lives of the Hebrews of old time
before the appearance of Moses, men beloved of God who proved that title true by
crowning themselves with the rewards of every virtue. Their pious doctrines also
and instructions I described, and moreover their perfectly true and religious
beliefs concerning God, which we have confessed that we Christians had come to
love and to desire. And now, following the order of succession, I will pass on
to the civil polity in the time of Moses, which after that first stage in
religion presents a second, namely that which, is provided with legal ordinances
quite peculiar to the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>For we shall prove at the proper opportunity that the institutions of Moses
were suited to Jews alone, and not to the other nations of the world, nor were
possible to be observed by all men, I mean by those who dwelt at a distance from
the land of Judaea, whether Greeks or barbarians.</p>
<p>But now I am going to set forth this mode of life, I mean the life in the
time of Moses, not in words of my own, but as before only in the words of the
very authors who have been approved among the Jews for their hereditary
learning: for I think it is proper for me to present the testimonies on which my
proofs rest, in the same way as I began, through the authors properly belonging
to each subject.</p>
<p>As therefore I called up Phoenicians, and Egyptians, and Greeks as witnesses
of the matters well known among themselves in their own country, so it seems to
me that the present occasion properly claims these Jewish witnesses, and not
that I should myself be supposed to be giving a superficial sketch of matters
foreign to me.</p>
<p>But before coming to this point, I think it necessary to set plainly before
my readers, how the oracles of the Jews passed to the Greeks, and what was the
method settled for the interpretation of the sacred writings entrusted to them;
showing also the number and character of the interpreters, and the great zeal of
the king, whereby those oracles came to be translated into the Greek language;
for the explanation of these matters also will not be unadvisable in regard to
my proof of the <i>Preparation for the Gospel.</i></p>
<p>For when the light of the salutary preaching of our Saviour was all but ready
to shine forth unto all men in the Roman empire, more than ordinary reason
required that the prophecies concerning Him, and the mode of life of the pious
Hebrews of old, and the lessons of their religious teaching, hidden from long
ages in their native tongue, should now at length come forth to all the nations,
to whom the knowledge of God was about to be introduced; and then God Himself,
the author of these blessings, anticipating the future by His foreknowledge as
God, arranged that the predictions concerning Him who was to appear before long
as the Saviour of all mankind, and to establish Himself as the teacher of the
religion of the One Supreme God to all the nations under the sun, should be
revealed to them all, and be brought into the light by being accurately
translated, and set up in public libraries. So God put it into the mind of King
Ptolemy to accomplish this, in preparation, as it seems, for that participation
in them by all the nations which was so soon to take place.</p>
<p>For we should not otherwise have got from the Jews those oracles which they
would have hidden away for their jealousy of us; but these in consequence of the
divinely ordered interpretation were vouchsafed to us in a translation by the
men who were approved among them for intelligence and hereditary culture.</p>
<p>These things are described by Aristeas, a man who besides being learned was
moreover engaged in the transactions of the time of the second Ptolemy, surnamed
Philadelphus, in whose reign the translation of the Jewish Scriptures, made
through the zeal of the king, was awarded a place in the libraries of
Alexandria. But it is time to listen to the author himself relating the matter
word for word in the following manner:</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>[ARISTEAS] 'WHEN Demetrius Phalereus was appointed over the king's library,
he acquired large sums of money with the view of collecting all the books in the
world, and by making purchases and transcriptions brought the king's purpose to
completion, as far as in him lay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'So being asked in our presence how many myriads there are of books, he
answered----&quot;Over twenty myriads, O king: and I shall endeavour to have the
rest made up to fifty myriads in a short time. It has also been notified to me
that the customs of the Jews are worthy of transcription and of a place in thy
library.&quot;</p>
<p>'&quot;What is there then,&quot; said the king, &quot;to hinder you from
doing this? For all that you can require has been assigned to you.&quot; And
Demetrius replied----&quot;An interpretation also is required; for in Judaea
they use characters peculiar to themselves, just as the Egyptians use their own
position of the letters, inasmuch as they have also a language of their own. And
they are supposed to employ Syriac, but that is not so, for it is a different
kind of language.&quot;</p>
<p>'And when the king understood everything, he ordered a letter to be written
to the High Priest of the Jews, in order that the aforesaid matters might be
completed.'</p>
<p>And further on he adds:</p>
<p>'And when this was accomplished, the king commanded Demetrius to report on
the description of the Jewish books. For all matters were arranged by these
kings in ordinances and with great accuracy, and nothing thrown off at random.
For this reason also I have given a place to the report and to the copies of the
letters, and to the number of the offerings sent, and the manufacture of each,
because every one of them was distinguished by the grandeur of the parts and
artistic skill. A copy of the report is as follows:'</p>
<p>CHAPTER III&nbsp;</p>
<p>'&quot;To THE GREAT KING FROM DEMETRIUS.</p>
<p>'&quot;IN accordance with thy command, O king, that the books which were
wanting to the completion of the library might be collected, and that the parts
which had been damaged might be properly restored, I have very carefully given
my attention to these matters, and now present my report to thee.</p>
<p>'&quot;There are wanting the books of the Law of the Jews, together with some
few others. For they are expressed in Hebrew characters and language, and are
rather carelessly written, and not as they are in the original, according to the
report of those who know best, since they have not had the benefit of the king's
providence.</p>
<p>'&quot;But it is right that thou shouldest possess these also thoroughly
corrected, because this legislation, being divine, is very full of wisdom and
sincerity. For which reason both prose-writers and poets and the multitude of
historians have avoided the mention of the aforesaid books, and of the men who
ordered their life according to them, because, as Hecataeus of Abdera says, the
mode of thought therein is of a pure and venerable character.</p>
<p>'&quot;If therefore it seems good, O king, there shall be a letter written to
the High Priest in Jerusalem, to send elderly men who have lived the most
honourable lives, and are experienced in matters of their own Law, six from each
tribe, in order that we may test the agreement by a large number, and after
receiving the exact interpretation, may give it a distinguished place, in a
manner worthy both of the circumstances and of thy purpose. Good fortune be ever
thine.&quot;</p>
<p>'And when this report had been presented, the king commanded a letter to be
written to Eleazar on this subject, informing him also of the release of the
captives which had taken place. He also gave for the manufacture of bowls and
cups, and a table, and flagons, fifty talents weight of gold, and seventy
talents weight of silver, and a large quantity of precious stones.</p>
<p>'And he commanded the treasurers to give to the artists the choice of
whatever they should prefer, and of current coin as much as a hundred talents
for sacrifices and other things. Concerning the workmanship, we will give you
information, as soon as we have gone through the copies of the letters. The
king's letter was in the following form:'</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>'&quot;KING PTOLEMY TO THE HIGH PRIEST ELEAZAR, GREETING AND HEALTH.</p>
<p>'&quot;WHEREAS it happens that many Jews who were carried away from Jerusalem
by the Persians in the time of their power, have been settled in our country,
and many more have come with my father into Egypt as prisoners of war, of whom
he enrolled many in the military class on higher pay, and likewise, when he
judged the chief of them to be faithful, built fortresses and entrusted them to
their charge, in order that through them the native Egyptians might be
intimidated: and whereas we having succeeded to the kingdom deal very kindly
with all men, and more especially with your fellow countrymen, for we have
released more than ten myriads of them from captivity, by paying their masters
the due price in money, and amending whatever wrong was done through the attacks
of the mobs, having taken a pious resolution to do this and to dedicate a
thank-offering to the Most High God, who has preserved our kingdom in peace and
in the highest glory in all the world: we have also enrolled in the army those
of the most vigorous age, and appointed those whom we judged capable to be about
our person and worthy of trust about the court.</p>
<p>'&quot;And whereas we wish to show favour to thee also and to all the Jews
throughout the world, and to those who shall come after, we have purposed that
your Law should be translated in the Greek language out of what you call the
Hebrew language, in order that these books also may be kept in our library with
the rest of the royal books.</p>
<p>'&quot;Thou wilt, therefore, be acting well and in a manner deserving our
favour, in choosing out men of honourable lives, advanced in years, who are
skilled in the Law and able to interpret it, out of each tribe six, that so
agreement may be obtained from the large number, because the inquiry concerns
matters of great importance. For we think that if this is accomplished, we shall
gain great glory from it.</p>
<p>'&quot;Now concerning this business we have sent Andreas one of the chiefs of
our bodyguard and Aristeas, men in honour with us, to converse with thee, and to
bring the first-fruits of our offerings to the temple, with a hundred talents of
silver for sacrifices and other things. And do thou also write to us on
whatsoever thou desirest: for thou wilt gratify us, and be doing what deserves
our friendship; for whatever things thou mayest prefer shall be performed as
quickly as possible. Farewell.&quot;</p>
<p>'In answer to this, Eleazar wrote back appropriately as follows:'</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>'&quot;ELEAZAR HIGH PRIEST TO KING PTOLEMY, TRUE FRIEND, GREETING.</p>
<p>'&quot;IF thou art in good health thyself, and Queen Arsinoe thy sister, and
thy children, that would be well, and as we wish; we ourselves also are well. On
the receipt of thy letter we greatly rejoiced at thy purpose and noble design;
and having assembled the whole people we read it before them, that they might
know the reverence thou hast toward our God.</p>
<p>'&quot;We exhibited also the cups which thou hast sent, twenty of gold, and
thirty of silver, five bowls, and a table for dedication of offerings, and a
hundred talents of silver for offering sacrifices, and for whatever repairs the
temple may yet need; and these have been brought by Andreas, one of those
honoured in thy presence, and Aristeas, noble and virtuous men, eminent in
learning, and worthy in all respects of thy training and just esteem.</p>
<p>'&quot;They communicated thy commands to us, and have also received from us
an answer befitting thy deeds. For in all things whatsoever are expedient for
thee. even if they are contrary to our natural disposition, we shall obey: since
this is a mark of friendship and affection. For in many ways thou hast conferred
upon our citizens benefits great and never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>'&quot;Immediately, therefore, we offered sacrifices on behalf of thee, and
thy sister and children, and friends; and all the people prayed that it may
happen to thee always according to thy desire, and that God who ruleth over all
may preserve thy kingdom in peace with honour.</p>
<p>'&quot;Also, in order that the transcription of the sacred Law may be made
conveniently and with safety, I chose out, in the presence of all, men of honour
and virtue, of mature years, from each tribe six, and these I have sent with the
Law. Thou wilt do well then, 0 righteous sovereign, in giving directions, as
soon as the transcription of the books is made, that the men may be sent back to
us again in safety. Farewell.&quot; '</p>
<p>Aristeas next interposes many statements concerning the proposed business,
and after his account of the translation of the Scriptures adds in exact words:</p>
<p>'And as soon as these volumes had been read, the priests and the elder men
among the interpreters and rulers of the city, and the leaders of the people
stood up and said: &quot;Since the interpretation of the books has been well and
reverently made and accurately in every point, it is right that they should
continue as they are, and that no revision take place.&quot; And when all had
shouted in approval of this saying, they commanded that, as their custom is, any
one who should make a revision by adding or by taking away or by changing
anything at all in what had been written should be accursed: in which they did
rightly, in order that it might be always preserved as an overflowing fountain.</p>
<p>'When this also had been announced to the king, he was greatly rejoiced: for
he thought that the purpose which he entertained had been safely accomplished.
And all was read over before him, and he greatly admired the mind of the
Lawgiver, and said to Demetrius: &quot;How is it that, when so great deeds had
been performed, none of the historians or poets ever attempted to make mention
of them?&quot; And he replied: &quot;Because the legislation was sacred, and had
come through God, and some of those who attempted it were smitten by God and
ceased from the attempt.&quot;</p>
<p>'For he said that he had heard from Theopompus, that, when intending rather
rashly to add to his history some of the passages which had been previously
translated out of the Law, he had suffered from confusion of mind more than
thirty days, but in the interval of relief he besought God that it might be made
clear to him, what the reason of the occurrence was: and when he had been taught
in a dream, that he had been over-curious in his desire to publish the divine
oracles to common men, and had desisted, he was thus restored to his senses.</p>
<p>'From Theodectes also, the tragic poet, I was informed that as he was going
to convert one of the events recorded in the Book into a drama he was stricken
with cataract in the eyes, and having got a suspicion that it had happened to
him for this reason, he propitiated God, and after many days was restored.</p>
<p>'And when the king had received, as I said before, the report from Demetrius
concerning these books, he reverenced them, and commanded that great care should
be taken of the books, and that they should be preserved in purity.'</p>
<p>Let this abridgement from the writing of the aforesaid author suffice: so now
let us take a view of the polity established by the legislation of Moses from
authors illustrious among that people. And I will give the first place to the
remarks of Philo on the journeying of the Jews from Egypt, which they made under
Moses as their leader, quoting from the first book of what he entitled <i>Hypothetica,
</i>where, in making his defence of the Jews as against their accusers, he
speaks as follows:</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>[PHILO IUDAEUS] <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> 'THEIR ancient forefather was
from Chaldaea, and this people, who had emigrated from Syria in old times,
removed out of Egypt, as they were increasing in countless myriads, and the land
was not sufficient for them; moreover they had been highly trained in youthful
confidence of spirit, and God also began to indicate their departure by visions
and dreams. Thus under divine influence they had fallen into a very great
longing for the ancient land of their forefathers, from which that ancestor of
theirs passed over into Egypt, either because God so determined, or he by some
foresight of his own became most prosperous, so that from his time to the
present the nation has existed and still continues, and is so exceedingly
populous.'</p>
<p>Then after a few sentences he says:</p>
<p>'Their leader in this exodus and journey was a man superior in no respect, if
you will have it so, to men in general; so often did they reproach him as a
deceiver and a mischievous flatterer. Yet what a noble deceit and craft was
that, whereby, when all the people were thirsty and hungry and ignorant of the
way and in want of everything, he not only carried them through in perfect
safety, and as it were in the midst of abundance, with free passage from the
nations that lay between, but also kept them free from mutual dissension, and
very obedient towards himself! This, too, he did not, as might be supposed, for
a little while, but longer than even a single household would probably dwell
together in unanimity and all abundance. And neither thirst nor hunger nor
bodily disease, nor fear for the future, nor ignorance of what was to happen,
stirred up against that deceiver the tribes who were deluded and perishing
around him!</p>
<p>'Yet what would you have me say? That the man possessed any such great art,
or power of eloquence, or wisdom, as to prevail over difficulties so many and so
strange, which were leading them all on to destruction? For either we must admit
that the men under him were not naturally ignorant nor discontented, but
obedient and not wanting in provident, care for the future: or else, that though
they were as bad as they could be, yet God soothed their discontents, and was,
as it were, the presiding guardian both of their present and their future lot.
For whichever of these cases may seem to you to be most true, it evidently is
strongly in favour of praise and honour and admiration for the whole people.</p>
<p>'These then were the circumstances of the exodus. But after they had come
into this land, how in time they became settled and got possession of the
country, is shown in the sacred records. For my own part, however, I desire not
so much to follow the method of history, as to describe what was probable
according to any fair calculation concerning them.</p>
<p>'For which do you prefer, that still abounding in numbers, although they had
been extremely afflicted, they were nevertheless strong, and then, with their
arms in their hands, took forcible possession of the country, by conquering both
Syrians and Phoenicians who were fighting in their own land? Or, are we to
suppose that though they were unwarlike and unmanly, and extremely few, and
unprovided with the means of war, they yet found respect in the eyes of these
nations, and obtained the land with their willing consent? And that then after
no long time they straightway built the Temple, and established the other
requisites for religion and worship?</p>
<p>'These things seem to show that they were acknowledged even among their
enemies to be most highly favoured of God. For enemies those necessarily were,
whose land they had suddenly invaded, to take it from them.</p>
<p>'If then among these they met with respect and honour, is it not evident that
they surpassed all others in good fortune? And what more than this are we to say
next as the second or third point? Shall we speak of their good laws well
obeyed, or of their holiness, and justice, and piety? So greatly did they admire
that man, whoever he was who gave them their laws, that whatever he approved
they approved also.</p>
<p>'Whether, therefore, he advised them from his own reasoning, or as he was
divinely taught, they referred it all to God: and though many years have passed,
I cannot say exactly how many, but more at all events than two thousand years,
they have not altered even a single word of what had been written by him, but
would rather endure to die ten thousand times, than yield to any persuasion
contrary to his laws and customs.'</p>
<p>After these statements Philo gives an epitome of the civil government founded
for the Jewish nation out of the laws of Moses, writing as follows:</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>[PHILO IUD.] 'Is there then among that people any of these customs or
anything like them, anything seemingly mild and gentle, admitting solicitations
of justice, and pretexts, and delays, and assessments, and subsequent
mitigations of penalties? Nothing; but all is simple and clear. If thou commit
sodomy or adultery, if thou violate a child, not to speak of a boy, but even a
girl, in like manner if thou prostitute thyself, if even at an unsuitable age
thou have suffered, or seem, or intend to suffer, anything disgraceful, the
penalty is death.</p>
<p>'If thou outrage either a slave or a free man, if thou keep him in bonds, if
thou take him away and sell him, if thou steal either common things or sacred,
if thou be guilty of blasphemy, not only by deed but even by a chance word,
against God Himself I may not even say (God forgive me for the very thought of
such a thing), but against father or mother or thine own benefactor, again it is
death, and that no common or ordinary death; but he who has only spoken
blasphemy must be stoned to death, as though for blasphemous deeds he could not
have been worse.</p>
<p>'There were other laws again, such as, that wives should be ruled by their
husbands, not from any motive of insult, but with a view to obedience in all
things: that parents should rule their children, for safety and greater care:
that every one should be master of his own possessions, unless at least he had
invoked God's name upon them, or gave them up as to God. But if it should happen
that he so promised merely by a word, he is no longer allowed to lay hand or
finger upon them, but is to be at once excluded from all.</p>
<p>'Speak not of plundering what belongs to the gods, nor of stealing what
others have offered; but even in regard to his own property, if, as I said, a
word has fallen from him unawares, yet having spoken it, he must be deprived of
all: but if he repents or tries to correct what he has said, even his life is to
be taken from him.</p>
<p>'Also in the case of others over whom a man has authority, there is the same
principle. If a man declare a wife's aliment to be consecrated, he must cease to
support her: if a father does so to a son, or a ruler to his subject, the effect
is the same. A release also of what had been consecrated was the most perfect
and complete, when the High Priest absolved, for under God he had the right to
receive it: but next to this, the absolution granted by those who in each case
have greater authority is allowed to declare that God is propitiated, so that it
is not compulsory to undertake the consecration.</p>
<p>'There are countless other rules besides these, all that either rest upon
unwritten customs and usages, or are contained in the laws themselves. Let no
man himself do what he hates to have done to him: let him not take up what he
did not lay down, neither from garden, wine-press, nor threshing-floor: let him
not steal from a heap anything whatever, great or small; let him not begrudge
fire to one that asks it; not shut up running waters; but to beggars and
cripples collecting food, give it. as a pious offering to God.</p>
<p>'Hinder not a corpse from burial, but help them to cast on more earth, enough
at least for natural piety: disturb not at all the graves or monuments of the
departed: add not bonds nor any further trouble to him who is in distress:
destroy not the generative power of men by excision, nor of women by abortive
drugs and other contrivances. Deal not with animals contrary to the way which
either God or a lawgiver has enjoined: destroy not seed: enslave not thy
offspring. Substitute not an unjust balance, nor a short measure, nor false
coin: betray not the secrets of friends in a quarrel. What place then, in God's
name, can we give to those famous Buzygia?</p>
<p>'But look at other precepts besides these. Separate not parents from
children, not even if they are thy captives; nor wife from husband, even if thou
art their master by lawful purchase. These, doubtless, are very grave and
important commandments: but there are others of a trifling and ordinary
character.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Rifle not the bird's nest under thy
roof: reject not the supplication of animals which flee as it were sometimes for
protection: abstain from any harm that may be even less than these. You may say
that these are matters of no importance; but at all events the law which governs
them is important, and is the cause of very careful observance; the warnings
also are important, and the imprecations of utter destruction, and God's
oversight of such matters, and His presence as an avenger in every place.'</p>
<p>Then after a few sentences he says:</p>
<p>'Are you not surprised that during a whole day, perchance, or rather not one
day only, but many, and these not following one another in immediate succession,
but after intervals of as many as seven days (while the custom of the ordinary
days always prevailed as is natural), they yet should not have transgressed one
of these commandments? Does not this (you may ask) result merely from their
practice of self-restraint, so that they are equally strong to work actively in
any labour, and to cease from their work if necessary? Certainly not. But the
Lawgiver thought it was necessary, even though at the cost of some great and
extraordinary pains, that they should not only be able equally to do or leave
undone all other things, but that they should be moreover well acquainted with
their ancestral laws and customs.</p>
<p>'What then did he do on these seventh days? He required them to assemble in
the same place, and to sit down one with another in reverent and orderly manner,
and listen to the laws, in order that none might be ignorant of them.</p>
<p>'And so in fact they do always meet together and sit down one with another,
most of them in silence, except when it is customary to add a word of good omen
to what is being read. But some priest who is present, or one of the old men,
reads to them the holy laws, and explains each separately till nearly eventide:
and after that they are allowed to depart with a knowledge of their holy laws,
and with great improvement in piety.</p>
<p>'Do you not think this is more necessary for them than the most urgent
business? So then they do not come to oracular interpreters with questions about
what they should do or not do, nor do they of themselves act recklessly from
ignorance of the laws; but whomsoever of them you accost and interrogate about
the national customs, he can tell you readily and easily; and each seems
qualified to impart a knowledge of the laws, husband to wife, and father to
children, and master to servants.</p>
<p>'Moreover it is easy to speak concerning the seventh year in like manner,
though not perhaps quite the same. For they do not themselves abstain from work,
as on those seventh days, but they leave their land fallow until the time comes
again, for the sake of productiveness. For they think that it is much better
after having had a rest, and that then it may be tilled for the next year,
without having been exhausted by the continuance of cultivation.</p>
<p>'The same thing you may see conducing to strength in our bodies; since it is
not with a view to health only that physicians prescribe intervals of rest and
certain relaxations from work: for what is always continuous and monotonous,
especially in the case of labour, seems to be hurtful.</p>
<p>'And this is a proof of it: for if any one were to promise to cultivate the
land itself for them much more this seventh year than before, and to yield up
all the fruits entirely to them, they would by no means accept it. For they
think that they not only themselves need to rest from their labours (though even
if they did so, it would be nothing strange), but that their land needs to get
some relaxation and repose for a fresh beginning of care and cultivation
afterwards.</p>
<p>'Else what was there, on God's part, to hinder them in the past year from
letting the land beforehand, and collecting from those who cultivated it their
tribute of the (seventh) year's produce?</p>
<p>But, as I said, they will in no wise accept anything of this kind, from care,
as I think, for the land.</p>
<p>'And of their humanity, the following is in truth a great proof. For since
they themselves rest from their work in that year, they think that they ought
not to collect or store up the fruits that are produced, as not accruing to them
from their own labours: but inasmuch as it is God who has provided for them
these fruits, which the land produces of its own accord, they think it right
that any who choose or are in want, travellers and others, should enjoy them
with impunity.</p>
<p>'Now on these points you have heard enough. For as to their Law having
already established these rules for the seventh-day sabbaths you are not likely
to question me, having probably often heard of this before from many physicians,
and physiologists, and philosophers, what kind of influence it has upon the
nature of all things, and especially upon the nature of man. This is the account
of the seventh day.'</p>
<p>So far Philo. A similar account to his is given also by Josephus, in the
second Book of his work <i>On the Antiquity of the Jews, </i>where he too writes
in the following manner:</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>[JOSEPHUS] <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> 'BUT who it was that made the best
laws, and attained the worthiest belief concerning God, it is easy for us to
discern from the laws themselves by comparing them one with another: for it is
time now to speak of these points.</p>
<p>'Now although the particular differences in the customs and laws received
among all mankind are infinite, one may go over them thus in a summary way.</p>
<p>'For some entrusted the authority of their civil government to monarchies,
and some to oligarchical dynasties, and others to the commons. Our Lawgiver,
however, paid no regard at all to these, but rendered our government, as one
might call it by a strained expression, a Theocracy, ascribing the authority and
the power to God, and persuading all the people to look unto Him, as being the
Author of all good things, both those which are possessed by all men in common,
and whatever they themselves obtained by praying to Him in difficulties;
persuading them also that it was not possible for any either of one's actions or
of one's inward thoughts to escape His knowledge.</p>
<p>'But Him he represented as uncreated, and for ever unchangeable, surpassing
in beauty all mortal form, and unknown in His essential nature, though known to
us by His power.</p>
<p>'I do not now stay to show that the wisest among the Greeks were taught to
entertain these thoughts of God from the principles which he supplied: but that
these thoughts are honourable and becoming to God's nature and majesty, they
have borne strong testimony; for Pythagoras and Anaxagoras and Plato, and the
Stoic philosophers who came after him, and almost all others, have evidently
entertained such thoughts of God's nature.</p>
<p>'But whereas these men addressed their philosophy to few, and did not dare to
publish the truth of their doctrine to multitudes prejudiced with other
opinions, our Legislator, inasmuch as he made his actions agree with his laws,
not only persuaded the men of his own time, but also inspired those who were to
be begotten of them in every age with a belief in God that nothing could remove.</p>
<p>'And the reason was, that he far surpassed all others in the tendency of his
legislation towards utility. For he did not make religion a part of virtue, but
made other things parts of religion, and so looked at them all together and
established them: I mean justice, temperance, fortitude, and the agreement of
fellow citizens one with another in all things.</p>
<p>'For all our actions and occupations, and all our discourse, have reference
to piety towards our God: and none of these did he leave unexamined nor
undetermined.</p>
<p>'For there are in all education and moral training two methods, the one of
which instructs by word, and the other by the training of moral habits. Other
legislators therefore were divided in their judgements, and having chosen the
one of these ways, each whichever pleased him, neglected the other. As for
instance the Lacedaemonians and Cretans used to educate by habits, not by words;
but the Athenians, and nearly all the other Greeks, enjoined by the laws what
things men ought to do or leave undone, but took little care to habituate them
thereto by actual deeds.</p>
<p>'Our Lawgiver, however, combined both these ways with great care; for he
neither left the practice of moral habits without explanation in words, nor
suffered the teaching of the Law to go unpractised; but beginning at once from
the nurture of infancy and from every man's domestic mode of life, he left none
even of the smallest matters freely dependent upon the wishes of those who were
to deal with them; but even about kinds of food, from which one must abstain,
and which one must adopt, and concerning those who should live in common with
them, and concerning their diligence in labour and on the other hand their rest,
he himself made the Law a limit and a rule, in order that living under this as a
father and a master we might neither wilfully nor through ignorance commit any
sin.</p>
<p>'For he did not leave even the excuse from ignorance, but appointed the Law
to be both the best and most necessary instruction, to be heard by them not
merely once, nor twice nor many times; but every week he commanded them to
desist from all other employments, and assemble for the hearing of the Law, and
to learn it thoroughly and exactly, a thing which all legislators seem to have
neglected.</p>
<p>'And so far are the greatest part of mankind from living according to their
own laws, that they hardly even know them; but when they sin, then they learn
from others, that they have transgressed the law. Those too who administer the
greatest and most absolute powers among them acknowledge their ignorance, for
they appoint those who profess to be expert in the laws to preside with them
over the administration of affairs.</p>
<p>'But any one of us whom a man might ask about the laws would tell them all
more easily th'an his own name. So by learning them thoroughly as soon as ever
we become sensible of anything, we have them engraven as it were on our souls:
and while there are few who transgress, no plea can possibly save from
punishment.</p>
<p>'It is this before all things that has produced in us so wonderful an
agreement. For to have one and the same opinion concerning God, and no
difference between one and another, is our daily life and customs, produces a
most excellent harmony in men's moral dispositions.</p>
<p>'For among us alone a man will hear no statements concerning God
contradictory one to another, though such things are frequent in other nations;
for not only by ordinary men is the casual feeling of each expressed, but even
among some of the philosophers there has been the same rashness of utterance,
some having undertaken to exterminate God's nature altogether by their
arguments, while others deprive Him of His providence over mankind. Nor will one
observe any difference in the habits of life; but among us there is a community
in all men's actions, and unity of statement, in agreement with the Law,
concerning God, declaring that He takes oversight of all things.</p>
<p>'Moreover in regard to our habits of life, a man may learn even from women
and servants that all other things must have piety for their end. Hence also has
resulted the charge which some bring against us, that we have not produced men
who were inventors of novelties in words or in works.</p>
<p>'For others think it a fine thing to abide by no customs derived from their
forefathers, and testify to the shrewd wisdom of those who are boldest in
transgressing them: but we on the contrary have understood that the only wisdom
and virtue is neither in act nor in thought to contradict at all the original
enactments of our Law.</p>
<p>'And this conduct may reasonably be considered a proof that the Law was
admirably ordained. For ordinances which have not this character are proved by
the tests of experience to require amendment: but for us, who were persuaded
that the Law was from the beginning ordained in accordance with God's will, it
would thenceforth have been impious not to guard it safely.</p>
<p>'For what part of it could one have altered? Or what could one have
discovered better, or what transferred from other laws as more useful? Should
the whole constitution of the state have been altered? But what could be nobler
or more just than the constitution which has made God ruler of the whole, and
allows the administration of the chief affairs to the priests in common, but
withal has entrusted the government over the other priests to the Chief Priest
of all?</p>
<p>'These from the very first the Lawgiver appointed to their honourable office,
not as superior in wealth nor in any other accidental advantages; but he placed
the service of God in the hands of those of his companions who excelled others
in persuasiveness and prudence.</p>
<p>'And herein was an exact care both of the Law and of the other institutions:
for the priests were appointed overseers of all things, and judges of disputed
matters, and punishers of those who had been condemned.</p>
<p>'What government then could be more holy than this? Or what honour more
befitting to God, since the whole people were trained to religion, and the
priests entrusted with an especial superintendence, and the whole state
administered in the manner of a religious solemnity?</p>
<p>'For what other nations call &quot;mysteries&quot; and
&quot;solemnities,&quot; and cannot observe in practice for a few days, these
things we observe through our whole lifetime with much delight and unalterable
purpose.</p>
<p>'What then are these premonitions and proclamations? They are simple and
easily known. And the first and leading precept is that which says of God, God
holds all things together, being all-perfect, and blessed, sufficing for Himself
and for all; He is the beginning, middle, and end of all things, manifest in His
works and gifts, and more conspicuous than any other being whatsoever, but to us
in form and magnitude most invisible.</p>
<p>'Every material, costly though it be, is unworthy to form His image; and
every art unskilled to conceive a similitude: no likeness of Him was ever seen
or conceived, or may without impiety be represented.</p>
<p>'His works we behold, light, heaven, earth, sun and moon, waters, generations
of animals, produce of fruits. These things God made, not with hands, not with
labour, not with need of any fellow workers, but when He willed them to be
beautiful, at once they were born in beauty.</p>
<p>'Him all must follow, and serve Him in the practice of virtue; for this mode
of worshipping God is the most holy.</p>
<p>'One temple of One God (for like is ever dear to like), a temple common to
all men for the common God of all. The priests continually serve Him, and their
leader is ever the first by birth. He together with his fellow priests is to
offer sacrifices to God, to guard the laws, to judge of disputed matters, to
punish the convicted. Whoever refuses to obey him must suffer punishment, as
guilty of impiety towards God Himself.</p>
<p>'The sacrifices which we offer are not for our own surfeit and drunkenness
(for these things are contrary to God's will, and may be made a pretext for
insolence and extravagance), but are sober, orderly, and simply arranged, that
in sacrificing men may be most temperate. Also at the sacrifices we must first
pray for the common salvation, and then for ourselves, for we are made for
fellowship; and he who esteems this higher than his private interest would be
most acceptable to God.</p>
<p>'In prayer let God be invoked and entreated, not that He give good things
(for He has given them of His own free will, and has imparted them in common to
all), but that we may be able to receive them, and, when we have gotten, to keep
them.</p>
<p>'At the offering of sacrifices the Law has prescribed purifications from
mourning for the dead, from defilement, from conjugal intercourse, and many
other things, which it would be too long now to write. Such is our doctrine
concerning God and His worship, and the same is also our law.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p>'Now what are the laws concerning marriages? Our law recognizes no other than
the natural intercourse with a wife, and that, if it is to be for the sake of
children. The intercourse of males it abhors; and should any one attempt it, the
penalty is death.</p>
<p>'It bids men marry, not out of regard to dowry, nor by forcible abduction,
nor yet by crafty and deceitful persuasion, but to ask a woman in marriage from
him who has the right to give her, and a woman suitable in respect of kin.
Woman, it says, is inferior to man in all things: therefore let her obey, not to
be insulted, but that she may be ruled: for God gave power to the man.</p>
<p>'With her alone the husband must consort, and to attempt another's wife is
unholy. But should any one do this, no entreaty can save him from death; nor if
he should violate a virgin betrothed to another man, nor if he should entice a
married woman.</p>
<p>'All children the Law ordered to be reared; and forbade women to cause
abortion or to destroy what is begotten: but if discovered, she would be guilty
of child-murder, for destroying life, and diminishing the human race.</p>
<p>'So then if any should proceed to defile the marriage-bed, he can no longer
be pure. Even after the lawful intercourse of man and wife, the Law enjoins
ablution: it supposed this act to involve a transference of part of the soul to
another place. For by growing into union with bodies the soul suffers ill, and
again when separated from them by death. For which reason, in all such cases,
the Law appointed purifications.</p>
<p>'Moreover, not even on the birthdays of children did it permit us to
celebrate a feast and make pretexts for drunkenness; but it directed the very
beginning of education to be temperate, and commanded us to instruct children in
the learning that relates to the laws, and that they should be acquainted with
the deeds of their forefathers; in order that they may imitate these deeds, and
being bred up in those laws may neither transgress them, nor have any excuse
from ignorance.</p>
<p>'It provided for the reverence due to the dead, not by costly funeral rites,
nor by erection of conspicuous monuments, but appointed the nearest relations to
perform the usual obsequies, and made it customary for all who were passing by
at the time of a burial to draw near and join in the mourning. It also commands
that the house and its inhabitants be purified from the defilement of death, in
order that one who has committed murder may be very far from thinking that he is
undefiled.</p>
<p>'It ordained the honour of parents to be next to that of God; and the son who
does not requite the benefits received from them, but fails in any point, it
delivers over to be stoned.</p>
<p>'It also says that the young must pay honour to every elder, since the eldest
of all things is God.</p>
<p>'It does not permit the concealment of anything from friends, because that is
no friendship which does not trust in all things: and if any enmity occur, it
has forbidden the disclosure of their secrets.</p>
<p>'Should any one acting as a judge take bribes, the penalty is death. If one
disregards a suppliant, when it is in his power to help him, he is responsible.
What a man did not lay down, he must not take up. He is not to touch anything
belonging to another. If he has lent money, he must not take usury. These
ordinances, and many like to these, bind close our fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>'But it is worth while to see also what was the mind of our Lawgiver in
regard to equity towards men of other nations: for it will appear that he made
the best of all provision, that we might neither destroy our own institutions,
nor begrudge those who wished to share in them.</p>
<p>'For all who are willing to come and live under the same laws with us, he
receives in a friendly spirit, considering that affinity consists not only in
race, but also in the purpose of life: but those who come to us only casually he
did not wish to be mixed up in close communion with us.</p>
<p>'He has, however, prescribed the other gifts which we are bound to impart; to
supply to all that are in need fire, water, and food, to show them the roads,
not to leave a corpse unburied.</p>
<p>'Also in the treatment of those who are judged to be our enemies we must be
equitable: for he does not let us ravage their land with fire, nor has he
permitted us to cut down fruit-trees; nay more, he has forbidden us to spoil
those who have fallen in battle, and has provided for captives, that no outrage
be done to them, especially to women.</p>
<p>'So far did he carry his zeal to teach us gentleness and humanity, that he
did not neglect the care even of brute beasts; but permitted only the accustomed
use of them, and forbade all other. Any of them which take refuge in our houses,
like suppliants as it were, he forbade us to destroy; nor did he suffer us to
slay the parents with the young: he bade us spare the labouring cattle even in
an enemy's country, and not put them to death.</p>
<p>'Thus did he provide on all sides what tended to clemency, by using the
aforesaid laws to instruct us, and on the other hand enacting the penal laws
without any excuse against those who transgress. For most of the transgressors
the penalty is death, if one commit adultery, if he violate a damsel, if he dare
to make attempt on a man, if one so attempted submit to be abused.</p>
<p>'In the case of slaves, also, the Law is equally inexorable. Moreover, if any
one should cheat in regard to measures or weights, or in an unfair and
fraudulent sale, and if one steal another's property, and take up what he did
not lay down, for all these there are penalties, not merely such as in other
nations but more severe.</p>
<p>'For in regard to injury to parents, or impiety towards God, if a man even
think of it, he is immediately put to death.</p>
<p>'For those, however, who act in all things according to the laws there is a
reward not of silver nor gold, no, nor yet a crown of wild-olive or parsley,
with a corresponding proclamation; but each man who has the testimony of his own
conscience is persuaded by the prophetic declaration of the Lawgiver, and by
God's confirmation of his faith, that to those who have constantly kept His
laws, and would readily die, if it were needful in their defence, God granted
that they should be born again, and receive in exchange a better life.</p>
<p>'I should hesitate to write thus now, were it not manifest to all by their
actions that many of our countrymen many times ere now, to avoid uttering a word
against the Law, have nobly preferred to endure all sufferings. And yet had it
not been the case that our nation is well known to all men, and that our
voluntary obedience to the laws is manifest, but had some one either read them
to the Greeks, saying that he had written them himself, or had asserted that
somewhere out of the limits of the known world he had met with men, who held
such a reverent notion concerning God, and had through long ages lived in
constant obedience to such laws, I think that all men would have marvelled,
because of the continual changes among themselves. At all events when men have
attempted to write anything of a like kind in regard to polity and laws, they
charge them with having made a collection of marvels, and assert that they
adopted impossible assumptions.</p>
<p>'And here I say nothing of those other philosophers who dealt with any such
subject in their writings: but Plato, though admired among the Greeks, both as
distinguished by gravity of life, and as having surpassed all who have been
engaged in philosophy in power of expression and persuasiveness, is little
better than scoffed at continually and ridiculed by those who claim to be clever
in political matters.</p>
<p>'And yet any one examining his writings would constantly find things milder
and more nearly like the customs of mankind in general. And Plato himself has
confessed that it was not safe to publish the true opinion concerning God to the
unintelligent multitudes. Some, however, think that Plato's discourses are empty
words written in a fine style of great authority.</p>
<p>Among lawgivers Lycurgus has been most admired; and all men sing the praises
of Sparta for having so long patiently endured his laws.</p>
<p>'Well then, let it be confessed that this is a proof of virtue, to be
obedient to the laws. But let those who admire the Lacedaemonians compare their
duration with the more than two thousand years of our political constitution:
and let them further consider that though the Lacedaemonians seemed to observe
their laws strictly so long as they retained their own liberty, yet when changes
of fortune occurred to them they forgot almost all their laws: but we, though
involved in countless vicissitudes, because of the changes of the ruling
monarchs of Asia, yet never even in the extremities of danger betrayed our
laws.'</p>
<p>These are the statements of Josephus concerning the political constitution of
the Jews established by Moses. But with regard to the allegorical meaning
shadowed out in the laws enacted by him, though I might say much, I think it
sufficient to mention the narratives of Eleazar and Aristobulus, men originally
of Hebrew descent, and, as to date, distinguished in the times of the Ptolemies.</p>
<p>Of these Eleazar, as we showed a little above, had been honoured with the
dignity of the High-Priesthood, and when the ambassadors had come to him from
the king for the sake of the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into the Greek
tongue, he sketches out the nature of the allegorical sense in the sacred laws,
and presents the doctrine of his discourse in the following form:</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>[ARISTEAS] <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> 'IT is worth while to mention
briefly the information which he gave in answer to our inquiries: for some
things included in the legislation usually seem to most persons to be
over-scrupulous, I mean about meats and drinks, and the animals supposed to be
unclean.</p>
<p>'For when we asked why, though there <i>is </i>but one and the same creation,
some animals are considered unclean for eating and some even for touching, the
legislation, which is superstitious in most things, is especially superstitious
in these distinctions; in answer to this he began as follows.</p>
<p>'You observe, he said, what an effect is wrought in us by our modes of life
and our associations, because, by associating with the bad, men catch their
depravities, and are miserable through their whole life. But if they live with
wise and prudent persons, instead of ignorance they secure an improvement in
their mode of life.</p>
<p>'Our Lawgiver therefore determined first the things pertaining to godliness
and righteousness, and gave particular instructions concerning them, not by
prohibitions only, but also by examples, showing manifestly both the injurious
effects, and the visitations wrought by God upon the guilty.</p>
<p>'For he explained first of all that God is One alone, and that His power is
made manifest through all things, every place being filled with His dominion;
and nothing that is secretly done by men on earth escapes His knowledge, but all
a man's deeds stand open and manifest before Him, as also the things that shall
be.</p>
<p>'Working out these truths therefore accurately, and having made them clear,
he showed that if a man should even think of working wickedness, not to say,
perpetrate it, he would not escape detection; for he showed that the power of
God pervades the whole legislation.</p>
<p>'Having therefore made this commencement, he also showed that all mankind
except ourselves believe that there are many gods, though they are themselves
far more powerful than those whom they vainly worship. For when they have made
statues of stone or wood, they say that they are images of those who invented
something useful to them in life, and they fall down and worship them, though
they have proof at hand of their insensibility.</p>
<p>'For to ascribe it to this cause, I mean to their invention, would be utterly
foolish; since they only took some of the things already created, and by
combining them showed more clearly that their constitution is most useful, but
did not themselves make them: wherefore it was a vain and foolish thing to make
gods of men like themselves.</p>
<p>'For even now there are many men more inventive and more learned than those
of former times, and they should at once fall down and worship them!</p>
<p>'The makers of these images and authors of these legends think that they are
the wisest of the Greeks. For of the other utterly foolish people why need we
even speak, Egyptians and the like, who have placed their reliance upon wild
beasts and most kinds of creeping things and cattle, and worship them, and offer
sacrifice to them both while living and when dead?</p>
<p>'So then our Lawgiver in his wisdom having taken a comprehensive view of
everything, and having been prepared by God for knowledge of the whole, hedged
us round with unbroken ramparts and with walls of iron, so that we might not be
mixed up at all with any of the other nations, but remain pure in body and soul,
freed from vain imaginations, and worshipping the One God more than the whole
creation.</p>
<p>'Hence the leading priests of the Egyptians, having looked closely into many
matters, and gained a knowledge of our affairs, surname us men of God: a title
which belongs to no others, except any who worship the true God; but the rest
are men (not of God, but) of meats and drinks and clothing; for they are wholly
disposed to betake themselves to these things.</p>
<p>'By our people such things are held in no esteem, but throughout their whole
life their contemplation is concerned with the government of God. Lest therefore
by sharing in any defilement, or associating with evil, we should ourselves
become depraved, they hedged us round on all sides with rules of abstinence, by
lawful meats and drinks, and touch, and hearing, and sight.</p>
<p>'For, speaking generally, all things are alike in reference to the natural
order, as being governed by one power, and yet taken singly there is a deep
reason in each case as to the things which we abstain from using, and those
which we use in common.</p>
<p>'To give an example, I will run over one or two things and explain them to
you. For I would not have you fall into the degraded notion that Moses enacted
these laws from superstitious scruples on account of flies, and weasels, or such
things as these; but all things have been reverently ordered with a view to holy
circumspection, and perfecting of moral dispositions, for righteousness' sake.</p>
<p>'For all the birds that we use are tame and distinguished by cleanliness,
feeding on various kinds of grain and pulse, as pigeons, doves, moor-fowls,
partridges, geese also, and all other birds of this kind. But the birds which
are forbidden you will find to be fierce and carnivorous, a tyrannizing over the
others by the strength with which they are endowed, and feeding with cruelty
upon the wasteful slaughter of the tame birds before-mentioned. And not only so,
but they also seize lambs and kids, and hurt human beings too, whether alive or
dead.</p>
<p>'So by calling them unclean he by them gave a sign, that those for whom the
legislation is ordained must practise justice in their soul, and not tyrannize
over any one in reliance upon their own strength, nor rob them of any single
thing, but steer their course of life according to justice, as the tame animals
among the birds before-mentioned consume the kinds of pulse that grow upon the
earth, and do not tyrannize to the destruction either of those beneath them or
of their own kind.</p>
<p>'The Lawgiver therefore taught that by such means as these indications are
given to the wise, to be just, and accomplish nothing by violence, and not
tyrannize over others in reliance upon their own strength.</p>
<p>'For whereas it was not proper even to touch the animals before-mentioned on
account of their several dispositions, ought we not to guard by all means
against our moral habits being broken down to this degree?</p>
<p>'So then all the permissions given in case of these birds and of the cattle
he has set forth in a figurative sense. For the division of the hoof and
separation of the claws is a sign that we should make a distinction in every
particular of our actions towards the side of right. 'For the strength of our
whole bodies when in action depends for support upon the shoulders and the legs:
therefore by the signification herein given he obliges us to perform all our
actions with discrimination towards justice; and especially because we have been
distinctly set apart from all men.</p>
<p>'For the majority of the other nations defile themselves by promiscuous
intercourse, working great iniquity; and whole districts and cities pride
themselves hereupon. For they not only have intercourse with males, but also
defile women after child-birth, and even daughters: but from these nations we
have been distinctly separated.</p>
<p>'But as man is the object to which the aforesaid symbol of separation refers,
so has the Lawgiver also characterized the symbol of memory as referring to him.
For all animals which divide the hoof and chew the cud manifestly set forth to
the thoughtful the idea of memory. For rumination is nothing else than a
reminiscence of life and sustenance.</p>
<p>'For life is wont to be sustained by means of food. Wherefore he exhorts us
by the Scripture in these words: &quot;Thou shalt surely remember the Lord God,
who wrought in thee those great and wonderful things.&quot; <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></p>
<p>'For when closely observed they are manifestly glorious, first the
construction of the body, and the distribution of the food, and the distinction
of each separate limb, and far more the orderly disposition of the senses, the
action of the mind and its invisible movement, its quickness in acting according
to each occurrence, and its invention of arts, have a delightful character.</p>
<p>'Wherefore he exhorts us to remember how the aforesaid parts are held
together and preserved by a divine power. For he has marked out every place and
time with a view to our continually remembering the God who rules them, while we
observe the beginning, and the middle, and the end of each.</p>
<p>'For in the case of meats and drinks he bids us first consecrate a part, and
then straightway use the rest. Moreover from the borders of our garments he has
given us a symbol of remembrance: and in like manner he has commanded us also to
set the inspired words upon our gates and doors, to be a remembrance of God.
Also upon our hands he expressly commands the symbol to be fastened, clearly
showing that we ought to perform every action in righteousness, keeping a
remembrance of our own creation, but in all things remembering the fear of God.</p>
<p>'He bids men also when lying down to sleep, and rising up, and walking in the
way, to meditate upon the works of God, not only in word, but also by observing
distinctly their own movement and their self-consciousness, when they are going
to sleep, and then their waking, how the alternation of these states is divine
and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>'There has been shown to you also the excellence of the analogy in regard to
distinction and memory, according to our explanation of the division of the hoof
and the chewing of the cud. For the laws have not been enacted without
consideration and just according to what came into the mind; but with a view to
truth and to the indication of right reason.</p>
<p>'For after the several directions about meats and drinks and cases of
touching, he bids us neither to do nor to listen to anything thoughtlessly, nor
to resort to injustice by employing the mastery of language.</p>
<p>'In the case of the wild animals also the same principle may be discovered.
For the disposition of the weasel, and of mice, and such animals as these, which
have been expressly mentioned, is destructive. For mice defile and damage all
things, not only for their own food, but even so far as to render utterly
useless to man everything whatsoever it falls in their way to damage.</p>
<p>'The weasel-kind too is singular: for, besides what has been said above, it
has a mischievous constitution; for it conceives through the ears, and brings
forth by the mouth. For this reason therefore such a disposition is declared
impure for mankind. For by embodying in speech all that they have received
through hearsay, they involve others in evils, and being themselves utterly
defiled by the pollution of their impiety, work no ordinary impurity.</p>
<p>'And your king, as we are informed, does quite right in destroying such men.</p>
<p>'Then, said I, you mean, I suppose, the informers; for he continually exposes
them to tortures and to painful kinds of death.</p>
<p>'Why yes, he said, I do mean these: for watching for men's destruction is an
unholy thing: and our law commands us to hurt nobody by word nor deed.</p>
<p>'On these subjects therefore it is enough for a brief description to have
shown you, that all things have been regulated with a view to righteousness, and
nothing has been appointed by the Scripture at random nor in a fabulous way; but
in order that throughout our whole life we may in our actual conduct practise
righteousness towards all men, remembering the God who is our Governor.</p>
<p>'So concerning lawful meats and things unclean, creeping things and wild
beasts, the whole system aims at righteousness, aud the just intercourse of
mankind.</p>
<p>'To me then he seemed to have made a good defence on the several points. For
with reference also to the calves and rams and goats which were to be offered,
he said that we should take these from the herds and flocks and make them tame,
and offer no wild or fierce animal, that the offerers of the sacrifices, having
perceived the symbolic meaning of the lawgiver, might feel no arrogant
self-consciousness.</p>
<p>'For he who brings the sacrifice makes the offering of the whole disposition,
of his own soul. Therefore on these points also I think that the particulars of
our conversation are worthy of consideration, because of the august character of
the law, which I have been led on to explain clearly to you, Philocrates, for
the love of learning which you entertain.'</p>
<p>These are the accurate distinctions concerning the idea set forth
allegorically in the sacred laws, which the High Priest gave to those Greeks who
had come to him, thinking them likely to meet with the translations of the
Scriptures which were about to be published. But it is time to hear what
Aristobulus, who had partaken of Aristotle's philosophy in addition to that of
his own country, declared concerning the passages in the Sacred Books which are
currently understood to refer to limbs of God's body. This is that very man who
is mentioned in the beginning of the <i>Second Book of Maccabees:</i><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
and in his writing addressed to King Ptolemy he too explains this principle.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>[ARISTOBULUS] 'WHEN, however, we had said enough in answer to the questions
put before us, you also, O king, did further demand, why by our law there are
intimations given of hands, and arm, and face, and feet, and walking, in the
case of the Divine Power: which things shall receive a becoming explanation, and
will not at all contradict the opinions which we have previously expressed.</p>
<p>'But I would entreat you to take the interpretations in a natural way, and to
hold fast the fitting conception of God, and not to fall off into the idea of a
fabulous anthropomorphic constitution.</p>
<p>'For our lawgiver Moses, when he wishes to express his meaning in various
ways, announces certain arrangements of nature and preparations for mighty
deeds, by adopting phrases applicable to other things, I mean to things outward
and visible.</p>
<p>'Those therefore who have a good understanding admire his wisdom, and the
divine inspiration in consequence of which he has been proclaimed a prophet;<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
among whom are the aforesaid philosophers and many others, including poets, who
have borrowed important suggestions from him, and are admired accordingly.</p>
<p>'But to those who are devoid of power and intelligence, and only cling close
to the letter, he does not appear to explain any grand idea.</p>
<p>'I shall begin then to interpret each particular signification, as far as I
may be able. But if I shall fail to hit upon the truth, and to persuade you, do
not impute the inconsistency to the Lawgiver, but to my want of ability to
distinguish clearly the thoughts in his mind.</p>
<p>'First then the word &quot;hands&quot; evidently has, even in our own case, a
more general meaning. For when you as a king send out forces, wishing to
accomplish some purpose, we say, The king has a mighty hand, and the hearers'
thoughts are carried to the power which you possess.</p>
<p>'Now this is what Moses also signifies in our Law, when he speaks thus :
&quot;God brought thee forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand&quot;;<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
and again: &quot;I will put forth My hand,&quot; saith God, &quot;and will smite
the Egyptians.&quot; <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Again in the account of the
death of the cattle Moses says to Pharaoh : &quot;Behold, the hand of the Lord
shall be upon thy cattle, and upon all that are in the fields a great
death.&quot; <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> So that the &quot;hands&quot; are
understood of the power of God: for indeed it is easy to perceive that the whole
strength of men and their active powers are in their hands.</p>
<p>'Wherefore our Lawgiver, in saying that the effects are God's hands, has made
the word a beautiful metaphor of majesty. The constitution too of the world may
well be called for its majesty God's standing; for God is over all, and all
things are subject unto Him, and have received from Him their station, so that
men may comprehend that they are immovable. Now my meaning is like this, that
heaven has never become earth, and earth heaven, nor the sun become the shining
moon, nor again the moon become the sun, nor rivers seas, nor seas rivers.</p>
<p>'And again in the case of living beings there is the same principle. For man
will never be beast, nor beast man. In the case of all the rest too the same
rule exists, of plants and all other things: they are not interchangeable, but
are subject to the same changes in themselves, and to decay.</p>
<p>'In these ways then God may rightly be spoken of as standing, since all
things are set under Him. It is said too in the book of the Law that there was a
descent of God upon the mountain, at the time when He was giving the Law, in
order that all might behold the operation of God: for this is a manifest
descent; and so any one wishing to guard safely the doctrine of God would
interpret these circumstances as follows.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p>'It is declared that the mountain burned with fire, as the Lawgiver says,
because God had descended upon it, and that there were the voices of trumpets,
and the fire blazing so that none could withstand it.</p>
<p>'For while the whole multitude, not less than a thousand thousands, besides
those of unfit age, were assembled around the mount, the circuit of it being not
less than five days' journey, in every part of the view around them all as they
were encamped the fire was seen blazing.</p>
<p>'So that the descent was not local; for God is everywhere. But whereas the
power of fire is beyond all things marvellous because it consumes everything, he
could not have shown it blazing irresistibly, yet consuming nothing, unless
there were the efficacy given to it from God.</p>
<p>'For though the places were all ablaze, the fire did not actually consume any
of the things which grew upon that mountain: but the herbage of all remained
untouched by fire, and the voices of trumpets were loudly heard together with
the lightning-like flashing of the fire, though there were no such instruments
present nor any that sounded them, but all things were done by divine
arrangement.</p>
<p>'So that it is plain that the divine descent took place for these reasons,
that the spectators might have a manifest comprehension of the several
circumstances, that neither the fire which, as I said before, burnt nothing, nor
the voices of the trumpets were produced by human action or a supply of
instruments, but that God without any aid was exhibiting His own all-pervading
majesty.'</p>
<p>Thus far Aristobulus. Now since we have gone through the commandments of the
Sacred Laws, and the nature of the idea allegorically expressed in them, it
would be next in order to indicate the following point, that the whole Jewish
nation is divided into two sections. And while the Lawgiver meant to lead the
multitude on gently by the precepts of the laws as enjoined according to the
literal sense, the other class, consisting of those who had acquired a habit of
virtue, he meant to exempt from this sense, and required them to give attention
to a philosophy of a diviner kind too highly exalted for the multitude, and to
contemplation of the things signified in the meaning of the laws.</p>
<p>Now this was the class of Jewish philosophers at whose strict course of life
thousands even of foreigners were struck with admiration, while the most
distinguished of their own countrymen, Josephus and Philo, and many others
deemed them worthy of everlasting remembrance. But passing by most of these
statements, I will be content at present, just merely for the sake of an
example, with the testimony of Philo concerning the said persons, which he has
set down in many places of his own memoirs. And of these do you take and read
the following from his <i>Apology for the Jews:</i></p>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>[PHILO] <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> 'BUT our Lawgiver trained to
community of living many thousands of his disciples, who are called Essenes
because, as I suppose, of their holiness. They dwell in many cities of Judaea
and many villages, and in large and populous societies.</p>
<p>'Their sect is formed not by family-descent, for descent is not reckoned
among matters of choice, but on account of zeal for virtue and a longing for
brotherly love.</p>
<p>'Accordingly there is among the Essenes no mere child, nor even a
scarce-bearded lad, or young man; since of such as these the moral dispositions
are unstable and apt to change in accordance with their imperfect age: but they
are all men full-grown and already verging upon old age, as being no longer
swept by the flood of bodily impulses, nor led by their passions, but in the
enjoyment of the genuine and only real liberty.</p>
<p>'And their mode of life is an evidence of this liberty: none ventures to
acquire any private property at all, no house, nor slave, nor farm, nor cattle,
nor any of the other things which procure or minister to wealth; but they
deposit them all in public together, and enjoy the benefit of all in common.</p>
<p>'And they dwell together in one place, forming clubs and messes in companies,
and they pass their whole time in managing every kind of business for the common
good.</p>
<p>'But different members have different occupations, to which they strenuously
devote themselves, and toil on with unwearied patience, making no excuses of
cold or heat or any changes of weather: but before the sun is up they turn to
their usual employments, and hardly give up at its setting, delighting in. work
no less than those who are being trained in gymnastic contests.</p>
<p>'For whatever occupation they follow, they imagine that these exercises are
more beneficial to life, and more pleasant to soul and body, and more permanent
than athletics, because they do not become unseasonable as the vigour of the
body declines.</p>
<p>'For some of them labour in the fields, being skilled in matters relating to
sowing and tillage, and others are herdsmen, being masters of all kinds of
cattle; and some attend to swarms of bees.</p>
<p>'Others again are craftsmen in various arts, who, in order to avoid any of
the sufferings which the wants of the necessaries of life impose, reject none of
the innocent ways of gaining a livelihood.</p>
<p>'Of the men then who thus differ in occupation every one on receiving his
wages gives them to one person who is the appointed steward: and he, on
receiving them, immediately purchases the necessary provisions, and supplies
abundance of food, and all other things of which man's life is in need.</p>
<p>'And they who live together and share the same table are content with the
same things every day, being lovers of frugality, and abhorring prodigality as a
disease of soul and body.</p>
<p>'Not only have they a common table, but also common raiment: for there are
set out in winter thick cloaks, and in summer cheap tunics, so that any one who
will may easily take'whichever he likes, since what belongs to one is considered
to belong to all, and the property of all to be on the other hand the property
of each one.</p>
<p>'Moreover if any of them should fall sick, he is medically treated out of the
common resources, and attended by the care and anxiety of all. And so the old
men, even if they happen to be childless, are wont to end their life in a very
happy and bright old age, inasmuch as they are blest with sons both many and
good, being held worthy of attention and honour by so many, who from free good
will rather than from any bond of natural birth feel it right to cherish them.</p>
<p>'Further then as they saw with keen discernment the thing which alone, or
most of all, was likely to dissolve their community, they repudiated marriage
and also practised continence in an eminent degree. For no Essene takes to
himself a wife, because woman is immoderately selfish and jealous, and terribly
clever in decoying a man's moral inclinations, and bringing them into subjection
by continual cajoleries.</p>
<p>'For when, by practising flattering speeches and the other arts as of an
actress on the stage, she has deluded eyes and ears, then as having thoroughly
deceived the servants she proceeds to cajole the master mind.</p>
<p>'And should she have children, she is filled with pride and boldness of
speech, and what she formerly used to hint under the disguise of irony, all this
she now speaks out with greater audacity, and shamelessly compels him to
practices, every one of which is hostile to community of life.</p>
<p>'For the man who is either ensnared by the charms of a wife, or by force of
natural affection makes children Ins first care, is no longer the same towards
others, but has unconsciously become changed from a free man to a slave.</p>
<p>'So enviable then is the life of these Essenes, that not only private
persons, but also great kings are filled with admiration and amazement at the
men, and make their venerable character still more venerable by marks of
approbation and honour.'</p>
<p>Let this quotation suffice from the aforesaid book: but from that on the
theme <i>That every good man is free, </i>I will bring forward the following
statements:</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>[PHILO] <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 'ALSO Syria in Palestine, which is
occupied by no small part of the very populous nation of the Jews, is not
unproductive of honourable virtue.</p>
<p>'There are said to be some among them named Essenes, in number above four
thousand, deriving their name, though not, according to my opinion, in an
accurate form of the Greek language, from holiness ( <font face="SPIonic">o(sio&amp;thtoj</font>
), because they have devoted themselves above all men to the service of God, not
by offering animal sacrifices, but by endeavouring to render their own thoughts
holy and reverent.</p>
<p>'These men, in the first place, dwell in villages, and avoid the cities
because of the civilized vices of the citizens, knowing that an incurable
contagion arises in the soul from a man's associates, just as a disease from a
pestilential atmosphere.</p>
<p>'Of these men some benefit themselves and their neighbours by tilling the
ground, and some by pursuing any arts that contribute to peace; not laying up
treasures of silver and gold, nor acquiring large sections of land from desire
of revenues, but procuring only enough for the necessary wants of life.</p>
<p>'For they alone of nearly all mankind having neither money nor possessions
themselves (from set purpose more than from want of good fortune), are
considered to be most wealthy, because they judge moderate wants and
contentedness to be, as they really are, abundance.</p>
<p>'Of darts, or javelins, or daggers, or helmet, or breastplate, or shield, you
would find no maker among them, nor in short any maker of arms or engines, or
any one employed about implements of war: nor yet about things which in times of
peace may easily slip into mischievous use: for of commerce, or trade, or
ship-owning they do not even dream, abjuring the incentives to covctousness.</p>
<p>'There is not a single slave among them, but all are free, giving help to
each other in turn: and masters they condemn, not only as unjust in outraging
equality, but also as impious in destroying the holy law of nature, which like a
mother having borne and nourished all alike, made them all genuine brothers, not
only in name but in very truth.</p>
<p>'But this natural kinship has been thrown into disorder by the excessive
prosperity of insidious covetousness, which has wrought alienation instead of
kindred affection, and hatred instead of friendship.</p>
<p>'Of philosophy they have left the logical branch to word-catchers, as being
unnecessary to the attainment of virtue, and the physical branch to star-gazers,
as too high for human nature, except so much of it as is made a study concerning
the existence of God and the creation of the universe, but the ethical branch
they study very elaborately, under the training of their ancestral laws, the
meaning of which it is impossible for the human soul to discern without divine
inspiration.</p>
<p>'These laws they are repeatedly taught both at all other times, and
especially on every seventh day. For the seventh day is regarded as holy, and on
it they abstain from their other works, and come to their holy places, which are
called synagogues, and sit in ranks according to their ages, the young below the
elder, and listen attentively in becoming order: and while some one takes and
reads their sacred books, another of the most experienced comes forward and
expounds all that is not easily intelligible: for most subjects are treated
among them by symbols with a zealous imitation of antiquity.</p>
<p>'So they are taught piety, holiness, justice, economy, statesmanship, and the
knowledge of things which are in reality good, or bad. or indifferent; the
choice of what is right, and the avoidance of the contrary, by using laws and
rules of three kinds, namely the love of God, the love of virtue, and the love
of mankind.</p>
<p>'First then of the love of God thousands of examples are supplied by the
constant and uninterrupted purity of their whole course of life, such as their
abstinence from oaths, their freedom from falsehood, their belief that the Deity
is the cause of all good and of no evil: examples too of their love of virtue,
in their freedom from the love of money, of glory, of pleasure, in their
continence, their endurance, also their frugality, simplicity, contentedness,
their freedom from conceit, their obedience to law, their steadfastness, and all
qualities of like character to these: examples also are seen of their love of
man in good-will, equality, and community of interests surpassing all
description, about which nevertheless it will not be out of season to say a few
words.</p>
<p>'In the first place then no single person has any private house, which is not
found to be also common to all. For in addition to their living together in
companies, the house is also thrown open to those of the same sect who come from
other parts.</p>
<p>'Next there is one and the same store and expenditure for all: their garments
also are common, and so is their food as they have formed themselves into
messes. For among no other people could any one find a common use of the same
roof, the same mode of life, and the same table, more firmly established in
practice, and perhaps with good reason.</p>
<p>'For whatever they receive as wages after a day's work, they do not keep as
their own, but bring it out in public, and supply the benefit of it in common
for all who wish to use it. The sick also are not neglected because they are
unable to earn anything, but have ready at hand from the common stock what is
needed for their sick-diet, so as to spend with perfect freedom out of that
larger abundance.</p>
<p>'For elders there is reverence and care, such as parents receive from their
own children, their old age being cherished by countless hands and thoughts amid
all abundance. Such are the hardy athletes of virtue produced by the philosophy
which is free from the superfluous pomp of Greek names, and proposes as
exercises those praiseworthy actions, from which the freedom that cannot be
enslaved derives its support.</p>
<p>'And of this there is proof, since many tyrants have at various times risen
up against our country, who exhibited different natural dispositions and
purposes: for some of them, endeavouring to surpass the untamed fierceness of
wild beasts, omitted no measures of cruelty, nor ever ceased from slaughtering
their subjects in droves, or even, like cooks, tearing them in pieces, limb from
limb, while yet alive, until they suffered the same calamities themselves from
the justice which keeps watch over human affairs.</p>
<p>'And others converting their wild excitement and frenzy into another kind of
wickedness, contrived an indescribable cruelty, while talking gently, and under
the disguise of softer language yet betraying the heavy wrath of their
disposition, and fawning like venomous dogs, became the authors of irremediable
mischief and left in every city memorials of their own impiety and hatred of
mankind in the never-to-be forgotten miseries of the sufferers.</p>
<p>'But yet none either of those monsters of cruelty or of those masters of
guile and treachery was able to lay anything to the charge of the aforesaid
society of the Essenes or Saints; but all were overcome by the noble virtue of
the men, and behaved towards them as being free and independent by nature,
singing the praises of their joint meals and of that fellowship surpassing all
description, which is the clearest proof of a perfect and most happy life.'</p>
<p>It may suffice then that the particulars of the philosophic kind of training
and public life among the Jews are set forth by these extracts; and our
discourse has previously described the other kind of life, which the divine laws
ordained for the mass of the whole nation.</p>
<p>After this then what is left, but to prove also that the theological tenets
of the moderns are in harmony with the religious beliefs of their forefathers,
so that our discussion of this subject also may be rendered complete?</p>
<p>Since therefore the oracles of the inspired Scripture are set forth in the
Book preceding this, let us on the present occasion closely examine the thoughts
of the wise men among the Jews, that we may learn what qualities the Hebrews
have shown both in theology and in excellence of speech. Again therefore we must
have recourse to Philo, from his first Book <i>On the Law.</i></p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>[PHILO] <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> 'FOR some who admired the world
itself more than its Maker represented it as being uncreated and eternal,
bringing a false and impious charge of great inactivity against God; whereas
they ought on the contrary to have been struck with admiration of His powers as
Creator and Father, instead of extolling the world beyond the bounds of
moderation.</p>
<p>'But Moses having early attained to the very summit of philosophy, and having
been taught by divine oracles the many most binding laws of nature, knew of
course that in existing things there must necessarily be both an active cause,
and passive principle: and that the active cause, the mind of the universe, is
most pure and unmixed, superior to science, and superior to absolute goodness
and absolute beauty; while the passive principle is without life, and incapable
of self-movement, but having been moved, and newly fashioned, and animated by
the mind, has changed this world into the most perfect work: those therefore who
assert that it is uncreated have unconsciously cut away the most beneficial and
indispensable of the inducements to piety, that is, Providence.</p>
<p>'For reason proves that the Father and Creator should care for that which He
has made. For a human father aims at the preservation of his offspring, and an
artificer of the works which he has made, and wards off by all means whatever is
hurtful, but longs to provide in every way all that is useful and profitable;
whereas towards that which he has not made there is no feeling of appropriation
in him who has not made it.</p>
<p>'Thus it is an undesirable and unprofitable doctrine to maintain that there
is anarchy in this world, as in a city, as though it had neither the ephor, nor
arbitrator, nor judge, by whom lawfully all things should be administered and
superintended.</p>
<p>'But that great man Moses deemed that the uncreated was most alien from the
visible, since all that can be perceived by the senses is subject to generation
and to changes, never remaining in the same conditions: he therefore attributed
eternity to that which is invisible and only perceived by the mind, as being a
brotherly and kindred quality, while to the sensible he assigned
&quot;creation&quot; ( <font face="SPIonic">ge/nesin</font> ) as its proper
denomination.</p>
<p>'Since therefore this world is visible and sensible, it must necessarily be
also created; wherefore it was not beside the mark that he described its
creation with a noble description of the nature of God.'</p>
<p>This then is what he has said on the subject of the world haying been
created. And the same author in his treatise <i>On Providence </i>states some
very vigorous arguments on the question of the universe being administered by
Providence, setting out first the objections of the atheists, and answering them
in order. And since most of these, though they may appear to be rather long, are
nevertheless necessary, I will set them forth in a concise form. He arranges the
discussion in the following manner:</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>[PHILO] <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 'Do you say that a Providence exists
amid so great confusion and disorder of affairs? For which of the conditions of
human life has been arranged in order? Nay rather, which is not full of disorder
and destruction? Or are you alone ignorant that good things come to the worst
and most wicked of mankind in riotous abundance, riches, reputation, honours in
the opinion of the multitude, chief power again, health, fine senses, beauty,
strength, enjoyment of pleasures uninterrupted because both of the abundance of
means, and of the perfectly settled and good constitution of the body, while
those who love and practise wisdom and every kind of virtue are, I may almost
say, all of them poor, obscure, unhonoured, and of low estate?'</p>
<p>After saying these and numberless other things besides in disproof of
Providence, he next proceeds to solve the objections by the following arguments:</p>
<p>'God is not a tyrant who has practised cruelty and violence and all the acts
of a despot's merciless rule, but as a king invested with gentle and lawful
authority, He governs the whole heaven and the world in righteousness.</p>
<p>'Now a king has no more appropriate title than &quot;father&quot;: for what
parents are to children in human relationships, such is a king to a city, and
God to the world, having combined in indissoluble union by unalterable laws of
nature two most noble qualities, the authority of the ruler and the kindly care
of a guardian.</p>
<p>'Just as parents therefore do not altogether neglect their dissolute sons,
but taking compassion upon their unhappiness watch over and care for them,
considering that it is the part of irreconcilable enemies to exult over their
misfortunes, but of friends and kinsmen to lighten their disasters. And
oftentimes they lavish their gifts upon these more than upon their
well-conducted children, knowing certainly that the prudent conduct of the
latter is an abundant source of wealth, while their parents are the only hope of
the former, and if they lose this, they will be destitute even of the
necessaries of life.</p>
<p>'In the same way God also, being the father of the rational intellect, cares
for all who have been endowed with reason, and takes thought even for those who
live a culpable life, both giving them opportunity for amendment, and at the
same time not transgressing His own merciful nature, which has goodness for its
attendant and such kindness towards man as is worthy to pervade the divinely
ordered world.</p>
<p>'This then is one argument which thou, my soul, must meanwhile receive as a
sacred deposit from Him, and a second consistent and harmonious with it of the
following kind. Never be thou so far misled from the truth as to suppose any one
of the wicked to be divinely favoured, even though he be richer than Croesus,
and more sharp-sighted than Lynceus, and stronger than Milo of Crotona, and more
beautiful than Ganymede,</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Whom for his beauty's sake the gods caught up&nbsp;<br>
          To heaven, to be the cupbearer of Zeus.&quot; <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>'His own divine faculty at least, I mean his mind, he has shown to be the
slave of innumerable masters, of love, desire, pleasure, fear, sorrow, folly,
intemperance, cowardice, injustice, and so could never be divinely favoured,
even if the multitude, failing of a true judgement, think him so, through being
bribed by a double evil, pride and false opinion, evils strong to ensnare and
mislead souls without ballast, and about which most of mankind are anxious.</p>
<p>'If, however, with the eye of the soul steadily fixed thou shouldest desire
to survey the thought of God, so far as is possible for human reason, thou wilt
have a clearer perception of the only true good, and wilt laugh at the things of
this world, which thou wert erewhile disposed to admire. For it is ever the case
that in the absence of the better things the worse are held in honour, as
inheriting their place: but when the better have appeared, they withdraw, and
are content with the second prize. 'Being therefore struck with: admiration of
that godlike goodness and beauty, thou wilt thoroughly understand, that with God
none of the things before-mentioned has been held worthy in itself to be ranked
as good; because mines of silver and of gold are the most useless part of the
earth, wholly and utterly inferior to that which is given up to the production
of fruits.</p>
<p>'For abundance of money is not the same thing as food, without which one
cannot live. One most clear test of this is hunger, whereby what is really
necessary and useful is put to proof: for a hungry man would gladly give all the
treasures in the world in exchange for a little food.</p>
<p>'But when the abundance of the necessaries of life flows in an immense and
unchecked stream, and is poured out over the cities, while indulging luxuriously
in the gifts of nature, we disdain to rest content upon them alone, but making
insolent surfeit the ruling principle of life, and eagerly pursuing gains of
silver and gold, we equip ourselves with all things from which we may hope for
any gain, and as if blinded by love of money we no longer discern in our mind
that silver and gold are mere lumps of earth, for which instead of peace there
is constant and uninterrupted war.</p>
<p>'Our garments indeed, as the poets somewhere say, are &quot;the bloom of
sheep,&quot; <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> and as to the artistic skill in
making them they are the weavers' glory. And if any one thinks much of
reputation, and welcomes the approval of the worthless, let him know that he is
also worthless himself; for like takes pleasure in like. 'But let him pray to
get a share of purifications for the healing of his ears, for through them the
chief disorders invade the soul. Also let all who are proud of their bodily
vigour learn not to be arrogant, by looking at the countless herds of animals
tame and untamed, who are born with strength and vigour: for it is a most absurd
thing for a man to pride himself on the good qualities of beasts, and that too
though surpassed by them.</p>
<p>'And why should any man of good sense exult in bodily beauty, which a short
time extinguishes by withering up its deceitful prime, before it has flourished
its full time; and that too though in lifeless things he sees highly prized
works of painters, and modellers, and other artists, in pictures, and statues,
and embroidered tapestries----works renowned in every city both in Greece and in
barbarous countries?</p>
<p>'Of these things therefore, as I said before, none is by God held worthy to
be ranked as good. And why should we wonder, if they are not so esteemed by God?
For neither are they so esteemed among men who are beloved of God, by whom true
excellence and beauty are held in honour, as they enjoy a well-endowed nature,
and have improved that nature by study and exercise, which are the creations of
a genuine philosophy.</p>
<p>'But as many as devoted themselves to a spurious learning did not imitate
even the physicians who heal the body that is the slave of the soul, though
professing as they do to heal the mistress, the soul herself. For those
physicians of the body, when any rich man has fallen sick, even if he be the
great king, pass by all the colonnades, the men's chambers, the women's
chambers, pictures, silver, gold uncoined or coined, abundance of
drinking-vessels or of tapestries, and all the other celebrated ornaments of
kings, and moreover disregard the crowd of servants, and the attendance of
friends or relations and subjects high in office, even his bodyguards, and when
they have reached the bedside pay no thought to the decorations of his person,
nor wonder that the couches are inlaid with precious stones and are of solid
gold, neither that the coverlets are of the finest web or embroidered linen, nor
that the patterns of his garments are of varied beauty; but even pull off the
blankets that cover him, and take hold of his hands, and pressing the veins note
the pulsations carefully, whether they are healthy. Oftentimes too they even
draw up his shirt, and examine whether the belly is distended, whether the chest
is inflamed, whether the heart beats irregularly: and then they apply the proper
treatment.</p>
<p>'And the philosophers also, who profess to practise the art of healing the
kingly nature of the soul, ought to disregard all the vain figments of false
opinions, and pass on within and feel the mind itself, whether its pulsations
are unequally quickened by anger, and unnaturally excited: also to touch the
tongue, whether it is rough and slanderous, whether it is given to wantonness
and extravagance: to feel the belly also, whether it is distended with some
insatiable form of desire: and to make a general examination of the several
passions, disorders, and infirmities, if they seem to be complicated, in order
that they may not mistake the remedies conducive to a cure.</p>
<p>'But now being dazzled by the brilliancy of the external things around them,
as they are impotent to discern an intellectual light, they have been for ever
wandering in error, not having been able to reach the sovereign reason; but
coming hardly so far as the outer portals, and being struck with admiration of
the attendants who stand at the gates of virtue, wealth and honour and health
and things of the like kind, they proceeded to worship them.</p>
<p>'But in fact as it is the excess of madness to use the blind as judges of
colour, or deaf men of musical sounds, so it is to take evil men as judges of
what is truly good: for these likewise are blinded in their master faculty of
thought, over which folly has shed a deep darkness.</p>
<p>'Do we then wonder now that a Socrates and this or that virtuous man
continued in poverty, as men who never practised any of the arts which lead to
gain, nor even deigned to accept what they might have taken from rich friends or
from kings who offered them large gifts, because they regarded the attainment of
virtue as the one thing good and beautiful, and while labouring at that took no
account of whatever else was good?</p>
<p>'And who would not thus disregard things spurious to provide the genuine? And
if as partakers of a mortal body, and burdened with the misfortunes of humanity,
and living in the midst of such<i> </i>a multitude of unrighteous men, the
number of whom it would not be easy to discover, if, I say, they were plotted
against, why should we lay the blame on their nature, when we ought rather to
reproach the cruelty of their assailants?</p>
<p>'For if they had been in a pestilential atmosphere, they must certainly have
fallen sick; and wickedness is more, or certainly not less, destructive than a
pestilential climate. And as the wise man, if he were to spend his time in the
open air, when it is raining, must necessarily get wet through, and when a cold
north wind is blowing must be pinched with cold and shivering, and in the height
of summer must be scorched with heat, since it is a law of nature that our
bodies are affected in accordance with the changes of the seasons; in the same
way the man who dwells in places of this kind,</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Mid murders, famines, and all kinds of death,&quot; <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>must in return necessarily incur the penalties which result from such evils.</p>
<p>'For in the case of Polycrates, when for his dreadful deeds of injustice and
impiety he met with a requital in the worse misery of his subsequent life----to
which you must add how he was punished by the great king, and was impaled, in
fulfilment of an oracle,----&quot;I know,&quot; said he, &quot;that not long ago
I seemed to see myself being anointed by the sun and washed by Zeus.&quot; <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
For these enigmatical utterances expressed in figurative language, though
originally obscure, received the most manifest confirmation through the facts
which followed.</p>
<p>'And not only at the end, but throughout his whole life from the beginning,
he had been unconscious that his soul was impaled before his body was: for he
was worried by perpetual fear and trembling at the multitude of those who were
plotting against him, and well knew that he had not one friend, but only enemies
implacable because of their misery.</p>
<p>'The authors too of the history of Sicily bear witness to the: unavailing and
perpetual caution (of Dionysius), and say that he entertained suspicions of the
wife who was dearest to his soul.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> And a proof of
it was this: he ordered the entrance into his apartment, by which she would have
to come to him, to be loosely covered with planks, that she might never creep
upon him unobserved, but might give notice of her arrival by the creaking and
rattling of her passage over the boards; also that she was to come to him not
simply undressed, but naked even in all those parts which ought not to be seen
by men. And in addition to this, he ordered the continuity of the ground at the
entrance to be cut across to the width and depth of a farm-dyke, because he
feared lest some attempt at a plot should be concealed from observation, and
this was sure to be detected by leaps or long strides.</p>
<p>'How full of miseries then was the man who took these precautions and devices
in the case of a wife, whom he ought to have trusted before all others! But in
fact he was like those who, in order to observe more clearly the natural
phenomena in the sky, climb precipices on a rugged mountain, and when they have
with difficulty reached an overhanging ledge are neither able to ascend any
further from failure of strength for the remaining height, nor have courage to
descend, but turn giddy at the sight of the chasms below.</p>
<p>'For having been enamoured of despotic power as a godlike and enviable lot,
he began to suspect that it was neither safe to remain nor to run away: for if
he remained, there were innumerable evils rushing on like a torrent one after
another against him; and if he wished to run away, there was the risk of his
life hanging over him, from men armed against him if not in their bodies yet
certainly in their thoughts.</p>
<p>'And this is made manifest also by the practical test which Dionysius is said
to have employed against the friend who praised the happy life of despotic
rulers. For having invited him to a display of a most brilliant and costly
banquet, he ordered a well-sharpened axe to be suspended over him by a very
slight thread: and when on reclining he suddenly saw this, he was neither bold
enough to rise up out of his place because of the tyrant, nor able from fear to
enjoy any of the luxuries provided for him; but giving no heed to the abundant
and costly pleasures, he sat with neck and eyes stretched upwards expecting his
own destruction.</p>
<p>'And when Dionysius perceived it, he said, Do you then now understand this
celebrated and enviable life of ours? For such, if one would not flatter
himself, is its real nature, since it contains great abundance of supplies,
without the enjoyment of any one good thing, but terrors coming one after
another, and dangers for; which there is no remedy, and a disease more grievous
than any cancerous and wasting sickness, which is continually threatening
irremediable destruction.</p>
<p>'But the inexperienced multitude being deceived by the brilliant display are
affected in the same way as those who are ensnared by ugly courtesans, who veil
their ugliness by dress and gold ornaments, and pencil their eyes, and fabricate
a false beauty for want of genuine to catch the beholders.</p>
<p>'Such is the heavy fate with which the over-prosperous are burdened, and of
which they estimate the excessive evils in their own mind and do not conceal
them; but, like those who are forced by pain to acknowledge their infirmities,
they give utterance to perfectly sincere expressions which are forced from them
by suffering, while they live surrounded with penalties both present and
expected, like beasts that are being fatted for sacrifice; for these also
receive the utmost care in order that they may be slaughtered to make a
plentiful feast of meat.</p>
<p>'Some men also have been not obscurely but manifestly punished for
sacrilegious gains: to give a list of their whole number would be a superfluous
labour, but one fact may suffice to stand as an example of all. It is said then
by the historians of the sacred war in Phocis, that whereas there was a law
established that he who plundered a temple should be cast down a precipice, or
drowned in the sea, or burnt to death, three men who had plundered the temple at
Delphi, Philomelus, and Onomarchus, and Phayllus, divided the punishments among
them. For the first was hurled down over a rugged and stony cliff by the fall of
a rock, and crushed to death; the second was carried by his horse, which had run
away, down to the sea, and being overwhelmed by the tide, went down, horse and
all, into a yawning gulf. And Phayllus either wasted away by a consumptive
disease (for the story about him is twofold), or perished by being burnt in the
conflagration of the temple at Abae.</p>
<p>'To say that these things happened by mere chance is a very perverse
contention. For though it would have been reasonable to allege the uncertainty
of fortune as an explanation, if some only had been punished either at different
times or by other kinds of punishment; yet when the whole band were punished,
and that about the same time, and not by other punishments, but by those which
were included in the laws, there is good reason to affirm that they were
overtaken by the judgement of God.</p>
<p>'But if any of the violent men who have been left unmentioned, and who have
risen up against the people, and enslaved not only other communities but also
their native countries, remained unpunished to the end, there is nothing
wonderful in that. For in the first place man judgeth not as God judgeth,
because, while we search out only visible facts, He noiselessly enters into the
recesses of the soul, and beholds the thought as clear as in the sunlight,
stripping off the coverings in which it is wrapped up, and surveying its devices
in their naked truth, and instantly distinguishing the false coinage from the
true.</p>
<p>'Never therefore let us prefer our own judgement to that of God, and say that
it is more unerring and more full of wisdom; for that is impious. For in the one
the causes of error are many, illusions of the senses, insidious passions, the
very formidable leaguer of vices; but in the other there is nothing that tends
to deception, but justice and truth, whereby each action is judged and naturally
rectified in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>'In the next place do not think, my good friend, that a temporary despotism
brings no advantage, for neither is punishment unprofitable, but for the good it
is either more beneficial, or not unnecessary, to suffer retribution; for which
cause this is embodied in all laws that are rightly constituted, and the
lawgivers are commended by all: for punishment is in a law what a tyrant is in a
people.</p>
<p>'Whenever therefore a terrible want and scarcity of virtue has overtaken the
cities, while an abundance of folly overflows them, then God desiring to draw
off the stream of wickedness, as it were the flood of a winter torrent, in order
to purify our race, gives strength and power to those who are in their natures
fitted to rule.</p>
<p>'For wickedness is not purged away without the help of some stern soul. And
in the same way as cities support public executioners to suppress murderers and
traitors and sacrilegious persons, not because they approve the disposition of
the men, but. because they find by experience the usefulness of their service;
in the same way the guardian of the great metropolis of this world sets up
tyrants like public executioners over the cities in which He perceives violence,
injustice, impiety, and all the other evils in full flood, that so He may at
length stop and abate them.</p>
<p>'Then also with regard to the agents, as having given their service from an
impure and ruthless spirit, He thinks it right to prosecute them last of all, as
being in a manner ringleaders. For just as the power of fire, after it has
consumed the fuel thrown upon it, feeds at last upon itself, in the same way
those also who have gained despotic power over peoples, when they have exhausted
the cities and emptied them of men, perish after them at last in satisfaction of
the vengeance due for all.</p>
<p>'And why do we wonder, if God makes use of tyrants to drive away a flood of
wickedness spread abroad in cities and countries and nations? For He often does
this by Himself without using other assistants, inflicting either famine or
pestilence or earthquake and any other visitations of God, by which great crowds
and multitudes of men perish every day and a large portion of the habitable
world is left desolate, because of His desire to maintain virtue.</p>
<p>'Enough however, I think, at least for the present, has been said to prove
that no wicked man is happy, a fact by which the existence of a providence is
most strongly established. But if you are not yet convinced, speak out boldly
the doubt still lurking in your mind: for by discussing the question both
together we shall know which way the truth lies.'</p>
<p>And after other things he says again:</p>
<p>[PHILO IUD.] <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> 'Storms of wind and rain were
not wrought by God, as you used to think, for the hurt of those at sea, or of
men who till the ground, but for the benefit of our whole race. For by rains He
purifies the earth, and by winds the whole region beneath the moon; and by both
together He nourishes plants and animals, and makes them grow, and brings them
to perfection.</p>
<p>'And if sometimes He hurts those who are voyaging or tilling the earth out of
due season, there is nothing wonderful in this; for they are but a small part,
and His care is for the whole race of mankind. As therefore the anointing in the
gymnasium is appointed for the benefit of all, yet the gymnasiarch, on account
of political necessities, often changes the usual order of time, whereby some of
those who were to be anointed are too late; so also God in His care for the
whole world, as it were a city, is wont to make summers wintry, and winters like
spring, for the general benefit, even though some shipmasters or tillers of the
ground would probably be injured by the irregularities of these seasons.</p>
<p>'Knowing therefore that the mutual interchanges of the elements, out of which
the world was compacted and still consists, is a very necessary work, He keeps
them free from hindrance; and frosts and snows and other things of like kind
follow upon the cooling of the atmosphere, and again lightnings and
thunderstorms follow upon the collision and friction of the clouds: none of
which things perhaps is the direct work of providence, but these are
consequences of rains and winds which are the causes of life and nourishment and
growth to things on earth.</p>
<p>'As for example, when from rivalry a gymnasiarch often incurs unlimited
expenses, some of the ill-bred being drenched with oil instead of water, shake
off drops upon the ground, and then immediately there is the most slippery mud,
yet no one in his right senses would say that the mud and the slipperiness had
been made by the intention of the gymnasiarch, but that they had been accidental
consequences of the abundance of the supplies (of oil).</p>
<p>'Again, a rainbow and a halo and all things of like kind arc-consequences of
the sun's rays being mingled with the clouds, not primary works of nature, but
accidents which follow upon the natural operations. Not but what these also
supply some necessary use to the wiser sort of men; for from these signs they
draw conjectures, and so foretell calms and winds, and fine weather and storms.</p>
<p>'Do you not see the porticoes in the city? Most of these face towards the
south, in order that those who walk in them may be warmed in winter, and catch
the breeze in summer. But there is also another indirect consequence, which does
not follow by the intention of the person who arranged them. And what is this?
The shadows which fall away from our feet mark to our experience the different
hours.</p>
<p>'Fire moreover is a most necessary product of nature, and smoke is a further
consequence of it. But nevertheless smoke itself sometimes offers an advantage.
For instance in the case of beacon fires at midday, when the fire grows dim from
the beams of the sun shining down upon it, the approach of enemies is indicated
by smoke.</p>
<p>'The same kind of explanation as in the case of the rainbow is also true of
eclipses, for eclipses are the consequences of the divine natures of the sun and
moon; and they are indications either of the death of kings, or of the
destruction of cities, a fact to which Pindar obscurely alluded on the occasion
of an eclipse in the passage previously quoted.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A></p>
<p>'The circle too of the Milky Way partakes of the same essential nature as the
other constellations, and though the cause of it is difficult to explain, those
who are accustomed to investigate the principles of nature should not shrink
from it; for the discovery of such things is most beneficial, and the inquiry is
also most delightful in itself to those who are fond of learning.</p>
<p>'As therefore the sun and moon, so also all the heavenly bodies have been
made by providence, even though we in our inability to trace out their several
natures and powers may be silent about them.</p>
<p>'Earthquakes too, and pestilences and thunderbolts, and all tilings of this
kind, though said to be sent from God. are not so in truth (for God is not the
cause of any evil at all), but these are produced by the changes of the
elementary atoms, and are not primary works of nature, but follow necessary laws
as consequences of the primary operations.</p>
<p>'If then some of the more refined experience their share in the damage which
these things cause, they must not lay the blame upon the administration. For in
the first place it does not follow, if certain persons are held among us to be
virtuous, that they are so in reality, since God's means of judgement are more
exact than any formed according to the standard of the human mind. And in the
second place foresight is content to look to the most comprehensive laws of the
universe, just as in monarchies and military governments it looks to the cities
and the armies, not to any one casual individual of the neglected and obscure.</p>
<p>'Some too say that just as it is customary when tyrants are slain that their
relatives also should be put to death, in order that wrong doings may be checked
by the magnitude of the punishment, in like manner also in pestilential diseases
some of the innocent perish with the rest, in order that the others may
prudently keep aloof; apart from the fact that those who venture into a
pestilential atmosphere must necessarily fall sick, just as those on board ship
in a storm share equally in the danger.</p>
<p>'Wild beasts too of great strength (for I must not pass over this in silence,
although with your powerful eloquence you were inclined to anticipate my defence
and pull it in pieces) have been created for the sake of training men for the
conflicts of war. For gymnastic exercises and constant hunting are excellent for
hardening and nerving men's bodies, and, what is more important than their
bodies, accustom their souls in the steadfastness of their strength to disregard
any sudden assaults of enemies.</p>
<p>'But those who are of a peaceable nature are allowed to pass their lives shut
up not only within walls but also within chamber-doors, safe from hostile
designs, with abundant herds of tame animals for their enjoyment; since boars,
and lions, and other beasts of like disposition are by their own natural
inclination driven far away from a town, from a desire to suffer no harm from
the devices of men.</p>
<p>'And if any from indolence live carelessly amid the lairs of wild beasts
unarmed and unprepared let them blame themselves and not nature for what
happens, because they neglected to take precautions as they might have done. For
instance, ere now at horse-races I have seen some persons give way to
thoughtlessness, who when they ought to have been sitting in their places, and
looking on in an orderly manner, stood in the course, and being knocked over by
the rush of the four-horsed chariots, were crushed by the hoofs and wheels, and
met the rewards of their folly.</p>
<p>'On this subject then enough has been said. But of reptiles the venomous
kinds have not been created according to providential design, but in the way of
natural consequence, as I said before. For they are quickened into life, when
the moisture that is in them changes to excessive heat. Some also are vivified
by putrefaction, as worms by putrid food, and lice by sweat. But all which have
their origin from a proper substance, in the primary and natural way of seminal
generation, are reasonably ascribed to providence.</p>
<p>'About these also, as having been created for the benefit of man, I have
heard two accounts, which I must not conceal. The one was of the following kind:
some said that the venomous reptiles were useful for many medical purposes, and
that those who regularly pursue the art, by using them scientifically for
suitable cases, are well supplied with antidotes, to the unexpected cure of
persons in the most dangerous condition; and to the present day one may see
those who undertake to practise medicine in no idle or careless fashion,
employing the several venomous reptiles in the composition of their remedies,
not without careful consideration.</p>
<p>'But the other story was not medical, but philosophical, as it seems. For it
asserted that these animals are prepared by God as punishments for sinners, as
scourges or even iron by generals and leaders. On which account, though quiet at
other times, they are stirred up to violence against the condemned, whose nature
passes sentence of death upon itself in its own incorruptible tribunal.</p>
<p>'But that they have their holes especially in houses is false, for they are
usually seen outside a town in open fields and desert places, avoiding man as
their master. Not but what, if it is true, there is some reason in it; for
refuse and filth in large quantities are heaped up in corners, and they like to
slip in under these, besides that the smell also has an attractive force.</p>
<p>'If swallows also live among us, it is nothing strange, for we abstain from
hunting them. And the desire of safety is implanted not only in rational souls,
but also in irrational. But none of those animals which we use for food lives
among us, because of our designs against them, except in nations where the use
of such animals is forbidden by law.</p>
<p>'On the sea-coast of Syria there is a city named Ascalon. Having been there
at the time when I was journeying to the Temple of my fathers to offer prayers
and sacrifices, I saw an incredible number of pigeons upon the roads and at
every house. And when I asked the cause, they said that it was not lawful to
catch them, for the inhabitants had been forbidden from ancient times to use
them for food. So thoroughly has the animal grown tame from fearlessness, that
it constantly came not only under the same roof but also to the same table, and
revelled in its freedom from attack.</p>
<p>'But in Egypt there is a still more wonderful thing to be seen. For the
crocodile, the most troublesome of all animals, addicted also to devouring men,
being born and bred in the most sacred waters of the Nile, although it lives in
the depths is conscious of the benefit bestowed upon it. For among the people by
whom it is honoured it multiplies exceedingly, but never appears at all among
those who injure it: so that in some places even the boldest of voyagers dare
not put down even the tip of a finger where the crocodiles congregate in shoals,
while in other places even the most timid persons leap out and swim in sport.</p>
<p>'But in the country of the Cyclopes, since their race is a legendary fiction,
in the absence of sowing and husbandmen there grows no eatable fruit, just as
nothing is produced out of that which does not exist. We must not accuse Greece
of being poor and barren, for here also there is much deep rich soil. And if the
country of the barbarians excels in fruitfulness, then though superabounding in
food, it falls short in the people to be fed, for whose sake the food is
produced. For Greece alone is truly the mother of men, as giving birth to a
plant of heavenly origin, and a godlike germ which has been brought to
perfection, namely reasoning united to science. And the cause is this: by the
lightness of the atmosphere the mind is naturally sharpened.</p>
<p>'Wherefore also Heracleitus makes no mistake in saying, &quot;Where the soil
is dry, the soul is most wise and virtuous.&quot; <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
And this one might conjecture also from the fact that the sober and frugal are
more intelligent, while those who are always filling themselves with drink and
food are least sensible, inasmuch as their reason is drowned by the things which
overlay it.</p>
<p>'Wherefore in the land of the barbarians plants and trunks of trees are very
tall from being well nourished, and the most prolific of irrational animals it
produces abundantly, but very little intelligence: because the successive and
continuous exhalations of earth and water have prevailed to hinder it from being
raised up out of the air which is its source.</p>
<p>'But the various kinds of fishes and birds and land animals are no reasons
for accusing nature as inviting us to luxury, but a terrible reproach to our
intemperate use of them. For to the completeness of the universe, that order
might exist in every part of it, it was necessary that all species of animals
should be produced; but it was not necessary that man, the creature most akin to
wisdom, should rush to feast upon them, and change his nature into the
fierceness of wild beasts.</p>
<p>'Wherefore even to the present day those who have regard to temperance
abstain altogether from them all, and feed with the sweetest enjoyment upon
green vegetables and fruits of trees as their dainties. But against those who
think that the feasting upon the aforesaid animals is according to nature there
have risen up in various cities teachers, censors, lawgivers, whose care it has
been to check men's immoderate appetites, by not permitting an unscrupulous use
of all things to them all.</p>
<p>'Roses also and crocuses, and all the other variety of flowers, are meant, if
for health, yet not all for pleasure. For their virtues are infinite, and they
are beneficial of themselves by their scents, filling us all with fragrance; and
far more beneficial in the medicinal compositions of drugs. For some of them
when compounded make their own virtues more conspicuous, just like the union of
male and female for the generation of an animal, each separately not being
fitted by nature to effect what both can do combined.</p>
<p>'These arguments I have been obliged to state in answer to the rest of the
questions raised by you, and they are sufficient to produce a satisfactory
belief, in those who are not contentious on the subject, of God's careful
superintendence of human affairs.'</p>
<p>These then are the brief extracts which. I have made from the writer before
mentioned, both by way of showing what sort of men the Hebrews have been
according to the testimony of the moderns, and at the same time of clearly
establishing the facts of their pious judgement concerning God, and of their
agreement with their forefathers. But now it is time to pass from this point to
the testimonies of foreigners on the same subjects.</p>
