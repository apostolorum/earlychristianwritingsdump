<p align="center"><b>Early Church Fathers - Additional Texts<br>
General Introduction</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">Everyone interested in the study of the Fathers of the Christian
Church must be aware of the 39 volume set of the fathers, issued by T. &amp; T.
Clark of Edinburgh in the late 19th century and continually in print ever
since.&nbsp; These fall into three parts: The Ante-Nicene Fathers, and two
series of Select Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers.&nbsp; It has been the
achievement of Harry Plantinga and his <a href="http://www.ccel.org/">Christian
Classics Ethereal Library</a> to transcribe these and make them available online
freely for us all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The original series of Ante-Nicene Fathers came out by
subscription in a different order as the Ante-Nicene Library, which was complete
by 1870.&nbsp; Since that time a considerable number of texts have been
published in English translation.&nbsp; Some were unknown to the compilers of
that series.&nbsp; Some had just been published and so were then in
copyright.&nbsp; Some translations were made later, often published by the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK).</p>

<p align="left">Still others were perhaps considered too obscure to be
commercially viable.&nbsp; The Texts and Translations Society in particular
published many texts in Syriac with an English translation, up until around
1921.&nbsp; Most of these derived from a collection purchased in 1842 in the
Nitrian desert in Egypt by Archdeacon Tattam and now in the British Library.</p>

<p align="left">This further collection of texts is intended to fill in some of
the gaps left by the Edinburgh series.&nbsp; All of them are now out of
copyright in the United States.&nbsp; Many are hard to find even in a good
research library.&nbsp; Where a library does possess a copy, it is not
infrequently classified as a 'rare' book.&nbsp; This status is almost the stamp of
death for a book.&nbsp; Photocopies will not be permitted, borrowing
unthinkable, so only whatever can be read in a visit will be accessible to the
rare visitor.&nbsp; For practical purposes, the text becomes inaccessible except to the silent
ceaseless agents of
biological decay.</p>

<p align="left">It is hoped to locate other out-of-copyright English
translations and place these online in this collection also.&nbsp; There seems
no good reason why every patristic text ever translated into English should not
go online, provided it is out of copyright.&nbsp; I would be glad to hear of any unknown to me.</p>

<p align="left">Texts are listed in chronological order.</p>

<p align="left">In some cases I have added an additional preface where I thought
it appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; These I place also in the public domain, in order to
avoid a pointless tangle of differing copyright permissions.&nbsp; Anyone may do
anything they wish with any of this material, whether for private, educational
or commercial purposes.&nbsp; I hope that copies will appear on other sites on
the internet, and on CDROM.&nbsp; The best way to preserve material is to ensure
it exists in many copies.</p>

<p align="left">It has not been possible for me to transcribe characters in
Syriac and Ethiopic, since I lack any knowledge of these scripts and
languages.&nbsp; I have omitted such material reluctantly.&nbsp; If any reader
feels the loss of these philological notes keenly, and would like to remedy the
situation, I should be glad to hear from them.&nbsp; The original page numbers
are indicated in the text.&nbsp; Footnotes have generally been renumbered and
placed at the end, because of the limitations of HTML formatting, but it should
always be possible to work out the number and page number of the note in the
original.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Some may ask what for whom this collection is intended, and what
spiritual value this literature has.&nbsp; These are fair questions, and I will
do my best to answer them.</p>
<p align="left">Firstly, little of this literature has spiritual value, in my
opinion.&nbsp; The majority of the authors wrote after the First Council of
Nicaea in 325, and did so within the context of the late empire, in which the
church was almost a department of state.&nbsp; Even at the beginning of the
fouth century, Eusebius records in his <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i> how many
clergy deserved the persecution which God then permitted to occur.&nbsp;
Constantine made this much worse by assigning all sorts of legal privileges to
the clergy.&nbsp; This inevitably created a situation in which worldly advantage
accrued to those who obtained orders; and a bishopric became a base for personal
power to the ambitious.&nbsp; The Eastern Roman Empire was an absolute
despotism, in which no political dissent was tolerated.&nbsp; However, a certain
amount of religious dissent was tolerated.&nbsp; It comes as no surprise
whatever, then, to find that every personal or regional rivalry manifested
itself in some form of theological innovation or definition.&nbsp; The
literature on these pages records the bitter, hateful infighting that
followed.&nbsp; In this process, Christ seems to have been no more than a name,
and the theological terms just the badges of factions, or just words to express
approval or hatred.&nbsp; The insane rivalries following the Council of
Chalcedon in 451 are copiously documented in the Ecclesiastical Histories in
this collection, and make frustrating reading.&nbsp; All of them are a
testimony, not to the power of God to redeem mankind, but to the power of
mankind to deprave itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The value of this literature is elsewhere.&nbsp; A great deal of
mythology circulates about the events of these years, and is sometimes used to
concoct libels on the Christians.&nbsp; It is the task of some of those engaged
in apologetics to look up the slanders and obtain the facts.&nbsp; A collection
of the primary data such as this is of immediate service in this
task.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also interesting of itself, and those interested in
finding out the facts of history for themselves will find it useful to have this
data onhand.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Some will ask whether delving into this is not a distraction
from the urgent task of helping our fellow man to escape from his sins and thus
from the reward of them, death and hell.&nbsp; This is a proper question for
anyone to ask, for life is full of distractions!&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of us must ask
Christ this question, and do what he commands.&nbsp; What follows is my own
answer.</p>
<p align="left">All of us would accept that learning, of itself, is a good
thing. Only if preferred to Christ, or used as an excuse to avoid what he
commands, does it become less than good.&nbsp; Even in World War 2, study did
not cease in our universities, and nor should it in our churches.&nbsp; It must
be secondary to evangelism, of course, but it too can be a work of love in the
service of others.</p>
<p align="left">Some Christians will be led by God and their natural inclination
to study this area of history, and of church history.&nbsp; Many will want to
dabble occasionally, and come in search of facts.&nbsp; This collection will
help.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is important for us not to become distracted or puffed-up by
book-learning, and to remain humble and aware that all of us are only forgiven
sinners.&nbsp; Many very great scholars have been very little men.&nbsp; Many
warm believers have forgotten the face of the Lord who saved them while
attempting to write a definitive monograph on some <i>minutia</i>.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, <i>abusus non tollit usum</i> -- we do not rule out the right use
of something just because it can be abused.&nbsp; The right approach for all of
us is not less time spent in study, but more time spent in prayer.&nbsp; May I
hope also that sometimes you will remember me in your prayers.</p>
