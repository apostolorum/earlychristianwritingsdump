<p align="center"><b>Dionysius the Areopagite, Works (1897). Preface to the
online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>John Parker's translation of the complete works attributed to Dionysius the
Areopagite requires some introduction, as he held views which were uncommon in
his own day, and are not held today.&nbsp; In particular, there is no doubt that
the works are a production of the late 5th or early 6th century.&nbsp; Likewise
the Liturgy which he attributes to the same author is in fact an independent
production.&nbsp; Details on all of these points may be found in the standard
handbooks such as Quasten's <i>Patrology</i>.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that Parker attempts to reinforce his eccentric views by
means of two arguments, neither without merit in the right place, but both
grossly misapplied.</p>
<p>Firstly he invokes the authority of the Christian church, and suggests that
faith in Christ Jesus requires us to accept that these works are genuine.&nbsp;
No doubt he was sincere, and some idea was present in his mind which does not
reach us.&nbsp; But I find no such statement in the scriptures, nor do the
fathers make a dogmatic issue of the matter.&nbsp; The church has no special
revelation on the question of the authenticity of these works; that they were
considered authentic by many in the pre-modern era reflects only the lack of
facilities to determine authenticity in that period.&nbsp; The unknown author of
these works attempted to attribute them to Dionysius the Areopagite -- why, it
is hard to imagine.&nbsp; But their value comes from their spiritual insight,
not their author.&nbsp;&nbsp; At all events, to use the name of God to prop up a
theory is to violate the second commandment, that we must not misuse the name of
God.&nbsp; Misuse of the name of God makes people less willing to listen when it
is legitimately invoked.</p>
<p>Secondly he attacks the integrity of the scholars -- German scholars -- who
stated that the text could not be first century.&nbsp; Now it is certainly true
that scholars of that period practised what the French today call
&quot;l'hypercritisme&quot; -- a wasteful, destructive process which ultimately
placed the purely subjective as the central authority.&nbsp; It is likewise true
that these same scholars served the cause of Satan by attempting to create a
climate in which faithful belief in the scriptures was impossible. Some of them
were not ashamed to&nbsp; create a consensus that rubbished the works of Lucian
of Samosata for reasons which have been shown to be taken verbatim from
non-scholarly anti-semitic publications.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; Such prostitution of
scholarship in the service of malice is disgraceful.&nbsp; On matters of
politics and religion, the consensus of scholarship is never more than a
reflection of what Dr. Johnson called 'the clamour of the times.'&nbsp; But that
does not mean that every conclusion of scholarship in the period could be
dismissed whenever it was unwelcome.&nbsp; It was a time of real scholarly
progress, even though tainted by unacknowledge bias and revisionism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Parker should have done was to discuss the raw data, and weigh it, for
and against.&nbsp; This he did not do.</p>
<p>Parker's notes therefore are mainly worthless.&nbsp; They have been
transcribed, but the reader will need to look elsewhere for information.</p>
<p>However, it would be unkind to leave matters there.&nbsp; John Parker did the
world a considerable service in making all these works available in
English.&nbsp; Perhaps he would never have done this but for his conviction that
they were apostolic.&nbsp;</p>
