<h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION: THE RECOGNITIONS OF CLEMENT (Sinai Epitome)</h3>

<p>The Recognitions of the Roman Clement are too well known in their Latin as
well as in their English dress to need any introduction to the scholar. They
have been extant hitherto only in the Latin translation of Rufinus of Aquileia,
who died A.D. 410<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. It was first published by Sichardus (Basle, 1526) and since
then by Cotelier <i>(Apostolic Fathers,</i> Paris, 1672), and by Gersdorf
(Leipzig, 1838). A Syriac translation was also&nbsp; <A NAME="pxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xv</SPAN></A>
published by de Lagarde in 1861,
from two MSS. in the British Museum, the older of which was written at Edessa,
A.D. 411. The Greek original used by Rufinus was prefaced by a letter from
Clement to James the Lord's brother, bishop of Jerusalem, which Rufinus left
out, believing it to be of a later date. </p>

<p>The Arabic text
given in this volume is contained in the MS. No. 508 of the Sinai Catalogue,
and is, compared to Rufinus's Latin text, a very short narrative. It omits almost wholly the
discourses of Peter and his discussions with Simon and others. It
would therefore be out of place here to do more than allude to the question of
the priority of the Recognitions or of the Clementine Homilies to one another,
a question which has been debated with so much acumen by A. Schliemann,
Hilgenfeld, Uhlhorn, Ritschl, Lehmann, Lipsius and others. Suffice it to say
that through the labours of Uhlhorn, Hilgenfeld and Ritschl, it is now pretty
generally acknowledged that, as Lehmann suggested, the three first books of the
Recognitions are the original document from which the Homilies were composed,
and that Books iv.-x. of the Recognitions were afterwards added from the
Homilies (Lehmann, <i>Die Clementinischen Schriften,</i> p. 21).&nbsp; </p>

<p> As to the date
of the text and its origin, we have internal evidence only to rely upon, though
it is evident from the date of the Syriac MS. Add. 12,150 in the British Museum
that it cannot be later than the fourth Century. Hilgenfeld has pointed out
that Matthidia was the name of the sister of Trajan, mother-in-law of Hadrian;
and that the name Faustina was borne by the wife of Antoninus Pius, as well as
by her daughter, the wife of Marcus Aurelius. The busts of these two ladies may
be seen in the British Museum. This suggests a date between A.D. 150 and 170.
The Recognitions, or a document closely allied to them, are quoted by Origen, <i>Philocalia,</i>
c. XXIII., <i>Commentary on Genesis</i> 21, which was written A.D. 231. </p>

<p align="center">[… Greek quotation from Origen…]&nbsp;<A NAME="pxvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xvi</SPAN></A> </p>

<p>
Then follows a long quotation, evidently from the Greek text translated by
Rufinus, Book x. a.10, 11, 12-23. It is given full by Robinson, <i>The
Philocalia of Origen,</i> Cambridge, l893.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
 All writers on the subject seem to
agree that Syria is the place of the origin of these documents, and that the
author was a Jewish-Christian, who held doctrines distinctly Ebionistic. This
Arabic text does not go so deeply into questions of dogma as the Latin or even
the Syriac texts; yet even here we have the superstitious reverence attached to
water both in baptism and ablutions; also the refusal of baptized Christians to
eat with unbaptized Christians; insomuch that Peter is represented as
continuing in the same narrow frame of mind for which his brother-Apostle found
it necessary to rebuke him (Galatians ii. 11-14.). The Arabic text is,
however, free from the outrageously heathenish idea that Faustinian's face was
changed by Simon Magus to look like his own; and the still more heathenish idea that an Apostle could be guilty of a pious fraud by turning the
metamorphosis to account.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
 A. Schliemann has also pointed out that the
hierarchical ideas in the Recognitions point to a Jewish Ebionistic
origin. Peter appoints a bishop off-hand, and also presbyters and <i>deacons, </i>the
former of whom are of the mystical number twelve. It deserves to be noticed,
however, that this Arabic text does not take its actors to Rome, but seems to
imply that they remained in Syria; and it therefore does not attribute to Peter
any breach of the covenant made with Paul (Gal. ii. 9). Nor does it contain any
mention of James the bishop of Jerusalem, to whom the Greek text used by
Rufinus was addressed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
 It is quite possible that this Arabic text is an epitome
by some Arab Christian monk who was more fascinated by the interest of the
narrative than anxious to edify his brethren by translating the discourses. If
so, we must grant that he has shewn considerable literary skill, and has
fully appreciated
the <A NAME="pxvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xvii</SPAN></A> dramatic side of his documents. As to the
story itself, there is nothing absolutely impossible in it. Communication
between Rome and Athens was comparatively frequent in the days of the Empire;
and if mere tent-makers like Priscilla and Aquila could have interests in
several cities and countries, there is nothing unlikely in a noble Roman lady
taking her children to Athens for their education and her own convenience. The only
circumstance that in my humble judgment seems somewhat improbable, is that
Faustinian should have been for several days in the Island of Aradus, and have
time to carry on a philosophical discussion with Peter's young followers: and
yet that he and his wife should have needed Peter's intervention to recognize
one another. </p>
