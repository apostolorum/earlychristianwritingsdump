<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER I</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THIS SIXTH BOOK TELLS ABOUT THOSE WHO SECEDED FROM THE
  COMMUNION OF PETER, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EXPRESS ANATHEMA OF THE SYNOD OF
  CHALCEDON AND THE TOME OF LEO, EITHER IN THE HENOTIKON OR IN THE LETTERS OF
  THE CHIEF PRIESTS TO HIM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matters having been thus arranged by the king's Henotikon, and three or four
of the chief priests, namely, the bishops of Ephesus, and of Jerusalem, and of
Alexandria, and of Antioch, together with the bishops in their jurisdictions,
being united and agreed together according to the purport of this Henotikon of
Zeno, and having received and subscribed to it; then Julian and John, presbyters
of Alexandria, and Helladius and Serapion, deacons, venerable men belonging to
the Church there, and Theodore the bishop of Antinoe, and John and another
Egyptian, and Andrew the great archimandrite,<sup> </sup>and Paul the Sophist,
and other illustrious monks, seceded from the communion of Peter of Alexandria.
But they took this course because there was no clear and decided anathema of the
Synod and the Tome, either in the Henotikon or in the letters of the chief
priests to Peter. And gradually the number of these Separatists was increased,
and they received a considerable accession to their numbers in the monastery.
And Acacius of the royal city, having heard it, wrote to urge them to be
reunited.</p>
<p>But Peter in his public address, and the other apologies which he made before
the people, continued to revile the Synod. And, at length, Acacius heard this
also, and he sent his presbyter to inquire into the freedom and the faith of
Peter. And there ensued an investigation before the judge of the <A NAME="p134"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|134</SPAN></A>
city on this point, that the Synod had not been expressly anathematised by
Peter, and the report of this reached the ears of many and proved a
stumbling-block to them. And many demands were made of him by the seceding
archimandrite and bishop. Then Peter the Iberian, the bishop of Gaza, who was
sojourning there, and Elijah the monk, sur-named <i>the potter, </i>were
appointed to consider and examine into these matters. And having examined into
them, together with the council of the monks, they selected four of Peter's
discourses concerning the faith, and they said to him, &quot;If thou dost agree
to these, sign them&quot;; and he signed them. Whereupon several of them entered
into communion with him, because he thereby anathematised the Synod and the
Tome, when he delivered those discourses in the ears of the people. However, the
others remained unwilling to hold communion with Peter. And the latter, seeing
this, took away the monastery of Bishop Theodore, and thrust out that wonderful
man, who had opened the eyes of a blind man by the aspersion of water from the
baptismal font. Upon which there arose a great agitation among the monks, and
they sent Nephalius, who was one of those that had been ejected by Peter, and
was also a disturber of the people, to Zeno the king.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER II</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THIS SIXTH BOOK TELLS ABOUT NEPHALIUS, WHO WENT UP TO
  THE KING, AND MADE A COMPLAINT AGAINST PETER ; AND HOW COSMAS THE <i>SPATHARIUS
  </i>WAS SENT (TO ALEXANDRIA), AND WHAT WAS DONE UPON HIS ENTRY THERE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nephalius,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> a monk,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
and by his disposition and habits a disturber of the people, made preparations
and went up to Zeno the king, bringing with him a letter from his fellow <A NAME="p135"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|135</SPAN></A>
Separatists ; in which they testified against Peter that he had plundered them,
and ejected them, and taken away their monasteries.</p>
<p>And the king, when he heard it, was very angry with Peter, and sent Cosmas
his <i>Spatharius </i>with a letter containing threats against Peter, and
declaring that his Majesty had been so indulgent as to appoint him the bishop of
Alexandria, with the object of uniting the people together, and not keeping them
divided into two parts.</p>
<p>And Cosmas having arrived, in company with Nephalius, and the letter having
been delivered to Peter: then the monks assembled at the Martyr Church of St.
Euphemia, to the number of about thirty thousand, and ten bishops with them. But
a message was sent to them, that they should not enter the city lest the people
should be excited, and a tumult<sup> </sup>should ensue. However, Theodore the
bishop, and John, and Julian and John the presbyters, and Palladius<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
and Serapion the deacons, and Andrew the Great, and Paul the Sophist, with about
two hundred archimandrites, were selected as representatives ; and they entered
the great church to have an interview with Peter. Then they had a long
conversation with Cosmas the <i>Spatharius </i>and the prefect of the city. And
the king's letter was read aloud.</p>
<p>Then Peter delivered an apologetic address to them, anathematising, in their
ears, the Synod and the Tome. And he further wrote in his own hand to the
following effect: &quot;I, Peter, the bishop of Alexandria, do now, as I have
often before, anathematise all that was said and devised in Chalcedon against
the true faith of the holy fathers, the three hundred and eighteen bishops; and
also the Tome of Leo. And I confess that these are my own works, and that anyone
not agreeing with them, whether bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or monk, or
layman, is an alien. And if I (or any other person) shall ever write in
agreement with the transactions of the Synod and the contents of the Tome, I
shall become thereby a castaway from the Holy Trinity.&quot; <A NAME="p136"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|136</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the monks would not accept this confession, for they said that Peter
associated in communion with the chief priests, who had uttered no express
anathema against the Synod and the Tome, as he had done.</p>
<p>And Peter replied, &quot;My reason for holding communion with them is that
they have accepted the king's Henotikon, which cancels all additions, and the
transactions of every place, except the three holy Synods, I mean those of
Nicea, Ephesus, and Constantinople. And in my public address I explained the
Henotikon, and showed you how it nullified the Synod of Chalcedon, by accepting
the twelve Heads of the blessed Cyril, and by anathematising Nestorius, and
Eutyches, and every other who would assert the duality of the Natures in Christ,
and would ascribe the miracles to one and the sufferings to the other, and would
divide the Persons in properties and in operations.</p>
<p>But after all this discussion, even then only a few of the monks consorted
with Peter. And the others presented a libel against him to Cosmas. And they
took their monasteries and dwelt in them, assembling by themselves. But they
endeavoured to appoint a bishop instead of Peter. However, Theodore the bishop,
being an orderly man, restrained them, saying, &quot;It is not fitting treatment
for one who believes as we do, and anathematises the Synod and the Tome (even
though he may hold communion with those that have received and signed the
Henotikon), lest we be blamed for rejecting him, and be accounted as disorderly
persons.&quot; But they say that Theodore took this course because he was one of
the bishops who laid hands upon Peter.</p>
<p>The people, however, since they received Peter without dispute when he
anathematised the Synod, were greatly incensed against the monks. But they were
restrained by the chiefs and by Peter, so that there was no public tumult. <A NAME="p137"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|137</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER III</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE THIRD CHAPTER TELLS HOW COSMAS, WHEN RETURNING TO THE KING, PASSED
  THROUGH TO PALESTINE, IN ORDER TO TAKE WITH HIM PETER THE IBERIAN AND ISAIAH
  THE MONK, ACCORDING TO THE KING'S ORDERS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Cosmas on his return passed through Palestine, and sought for Peter the
Illustrious and Isaiah the able monk. However, he could not find Peter, because
the latter had previous intimation of his coming, and had departed from before
him.</p>
<p>But Isaiah prayed to God that a sickness might overtake him ; lest, if he
were to go up to the royal city, he might show himself a flatterer of the rich
men there. And so it befell him.</p>
<p>And when Cosmas reached him and gave him the king's letter, he showed him his
sickness and infirmity, saying, &quot;As I am a sick man, I cannot possibly
endure to embark upon the sea, lest I die at once. And then I could not appear
before the king; and you would be censured both by God and the king if you were
to carry a corpse round the world.&quot; And in this way he succeeded in
escaping. And shortly afterwards he recovered. And he persevered in the exercise
of his habits, and of his conflicts all the days of his life. This man was
indeed a seer, a sharer (as we may say) in the name and in the actions of the
prophet Isaiah. <A NAME="p138"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|138</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IV</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FOURTH CHAPTER TELLS HOW ARSENIUS WAS SENT AS PREFECT TO ALEXANDRIA BY
  THE KING, WHEN THE LATTER LEARNED THE STATE OF AFFAIRS FROM COSMAS RESPECTING
  THE SEPARATIST MONKS AND THE ORDERS THEN GIVEN BY THE PREFECT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Cosmas <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><i> </i>the <i>Spatharius </i>returned
to the king, and presented a written communication informing him of the affairs
in Alexandria, and about the Separatist monks, and their leaders, and the
bishops; then he sent Arsenius there as prefect, and also gave him authority
over the Romans. And he ordered that Theodore and John the bishops, and Agathon,
and Julian, and John the presbyters, and Helladius and Serapion the deacons, and
Paul and Andrew the archimandrites, and all the others should be called to
unity, according to the terms of the faith laid down in the Henotikon, once or
twice, by Peter the bishop of Alexandria ; and that, in the event of their
refusing to join in communion with him, they should be ejected from their
monasteries.</p>
<p>And upon the arrival of Arsenius, this Nephalius, the disturber of the
people, again attached himself to him. Then he brought together the bishops and
the presbyters and the archimandrites; and he showed them the king's command,
which he read aloud in their hearing. And Peter also readily repeated to them
his explanation and anathema, at the same time entreating them to join in
communion with himself. However, they would neither accept nor be satisfied with
this. But Theodore the bishop said to him, &quot;If you make a written statement
abjuring the communion of the other chief priests and sign it, then we will
enter into communion with you.&quot; And Peter, in reply, made the same defence
as before, saying, &quot;It is right for me to associate with those who receive
the Henotikon, which teaches the true faith.&quot; <A NAME="p139"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|139</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereupon these men were compelled by Arsenius to go to the king, and
personally to lay their petitions and wishes before him; so that then his
command might be fully carried out. And they all went, with the exception of
Theodore, who withdrew himself. And when they appeared before the king, he was
astonished both at their chastity and at their reasoning with him about
everything which was displeasing to them in his transactions.</p>
<p>But while they were there, Acacius <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><i> </i>the
bishop of Constantinople died. And Fravitta was appointed as his successor; a
gentle and believing man, who wrote a letter, after the canonical manner, and
sent it by some clergy, to Peter of Alexandria. And Peter received it gladly;
and he also wrote a reply, in which he expressly anathematised the Synod and the
Tome of Leo. And while this was on its way, Fravitta died. And Euphemius, a man
of Apamea, who was educated at Alexandria, was appointed as his successor.
However, he was tainted with the Nestorian heresy.</p>
<p>And when he received the letter he was very indignant. And he was even angry
with Longinus the presbyter and Andrew the deacon, the clergy who conveyed this
letter; and he brought an accusation against them. But they deprecated his
accusation by showing the zeal of the people of Alexandria. And Euphemius
severed himself from Peter's communion ; and he sought to bring about the
deprivation of Peter, intending for that purpose to convene a separate Synod.
But Archelaus the bishop of Caesarea, a man of wonderful learning, restrained
him, saying, &quot;It is not possible for the great bishop of Alexandria to be
accused and ejected by a Synod of one province; only a General Council could do
that.&quot; But when Peter heard it, he also uttered threats against Euphemius;
that, just as the blessed Cyril had sent Nestorius to Oasis, so he would in like
manner eject Euphemius from his see. However, Peter also departed this life. But
his letter was seen in Constantinople, and it convinced many that he was a
believer. And John and Julian the Alexandrians, and the rest of their associates
who happened to be there, the Separatists, on seeing <A NAME="p140"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|140</SPAN></A>
his letter to Fravitta, changed their minds; and they were ready on their return
to Alexandria to join in communion with him. But while they were returning, he
died. And his successor <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> was Athanasius, an
eloquent, believing, and peace-loving man. He, desiring and exerting himself to
bring the Separatist monks into communion with the Church, in the course of his
address to the people mentioned the names of Dioscorus and Timothy, but he
purposely omitted to mention the name of Peter in order to try them. Whereupon
they became greatly excited (and they would not be quiet) until he named Peter
also in his discourse.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER V</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK GIVES THE LETTER OF FRAVITTA OF
  CONSTANTINOPLE TO PETER OF ALEXANDRIA, IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;To our holy father, and God-loving fellow - minister, Peter, from
Fravitta, who sends greetings in the Lord. When I weigh mine own natural
weakness, and I wonder at the merciful acts of God towards me, I truly perceive
that it is absolutely (?) that 'He raises up the poor from the dunghill to set
him with the princes of the people.' And it is well known that this mercy of God
is not the consequence of any meritorious deeds on man's part; but that it
results from the divine grace which arises, time after time, upon the sons of
the Church, through the love of the Father. So that it is not the wise, nor the
disputers, nor the eloquent of this world whom grace raises up as leaders by the
election.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, before the Law, Abel, though not learned, was acceptable to God;
as were also the righteous fathers who came after him. But under the Law, grace
marked out shepherds and herdsmen, and gatherers of sycamore fruit,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
and raised them up as prophets. And after the Law, the same <A NAME="p141"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|141</SPAN></A>
grace appointed fishermen, and a tent-maker, to be the preachers of the living
word from heaven. That thus the power of God might be truly known to be made
manifest and perfect in the weak. And such are the mysteries of Christians who
hold fast the Incarnation of Christ; according to His own word in the Gospel, 'I
thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so,
Father, for such is Thine own will.'<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;For Jesus Christ our God is the foundation and the corner-stone of the
Holy Church. And therefore these blessings, which we have received, are not a
strange display of His mercy. But we hope that from them we shall understand His
equal mercy towards other men ; and we shall show ourselves gentle and kind to
our brethren in the flesh and in the faith, and to the priests who are our
fellow-ministers and Christ-loving brothers. Thus we shall endeavour to rule the
Holy Church everywhere in the same right faith, and in perfect love. And by the
events which are taking place (the Lord helping us) we shall show the rational
flock which has been intrusted to our care in all places to be one; that of the
Great Shepherd, Who has appointed us to be the leaders of His flock. And we
shall drive out those grievous wolves, the accursed heresies, more especially of
Nestorius and Eutyches, by preaching and holding the faith of the holy fathers,
who maintained the truth and preserved the order of the Church, and in our day
teaching the right faith to the people and to mankind, as well as they.</p>
<p>&quot;But, using brotherly love and concord in my salutation, I now present
to thy Holiness the pledge of my affection, by the hands of Longinus the
presbyter and Andrew the deacon. And to complete what is right, I send my
greetings to all the pastors, and the honourable priests, and the chaste monks,
and the believing people of thy jurisdiction. We, <A NAME="p142"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|142</SPAN></A>
moreover, entreat thy Holiness to pray along with us, that we may show ourselves
wise men and rulers in all matters, like Solomon, and like Paul and Peter and
the rest of the apostles, in preaching the truth to the sons of the Church; and
that in everything about which you refer to us, we may be able, to the best of
our ability, to render fitting aid to the other Churches; and also in those
matters taking place in the Christ-loving city, through the enactment of the
Christ-loving and indulgent king, who is watchful and studious and desirous to
bring about the peace of the Churches, and the concord of the priests, and the
unity of the people.</p>
<p>&quot;I and the brethren with me send our best respects to thy Chastity, and
to the brethren with thee.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VI</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>THE SIXTH CHAPTER OF THIS SIXTH BOOK TELLS ABOUT THE LETTER OF PETER THE
  BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA, WHICH HE WROTE IN REPLY TO FRAVITTA OF CONSTANTINOPLE,
  IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;To my pious and God-loving brother and fellow-minister, my lord
Fravitta, from Peter, who sends greetings in the Lord.</p>
<p>&quot;In consequence of the election of thine Eminence, it is time now for us
to say, 'Ye heavens above be glad, and let the earth with her fulness rejoice,
and let her sing with joy,' according to the word of the prophet.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;For also, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the one only-begotten Son of
God the Father, has not redeemed us with corruptible things, as silver and gold;
but He rather laid down His life for us, as a lamb without blemish; and He
offered a sacrifice of sweet savour to God His Father; and <A NAME="p143"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|143</SPAN></A>
gave His body as a substitute for the life of the whole human race. He Who is
honoured by all creation, and is equal to the Father, God the Word, became
incarnate; yet He suffered thereby no variation nor change; but He as man
remains the same, and He is in truth alive for ever, the Word of His Father, and
of the same nature. Come then, as with one tongue and one believing,
Christ-loving mind, let us offer to Him thanksgiving, and say with the blessed
Baruch, This is our God, there is none other beside Him. He found out the whole
way of wisdom, and gave it to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved. And
afterwards, He appeared upon the earth, and had converse with men.'<sup>1</sup><i>
</i>For there was not indeed One the Son of God, Who existed before the times
and ages, through Whom all things were made; and another who, in the last time,
was born in the flesh from the <i>Theotokos</i>; according to the notion of
Nestorius. But rather He, being the<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> same, took
the seed of Abraham, according to the word of the blessed Paul;<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
and also He was partaker of our flesh and blood, and was made like us in all
points, sin only excepted. For neither do we say that the body of our Lord Jesus
Christ is from heaven, as Eutyches in his folly affirms; nor that He became
incarnate in semblance or imagination; on the contrary, we anathematise all such
teachers. But we confess one only-begotten Son of God the Father, Who is our
Lord Jesus Christ. And we know that He, God the Word of the Father, Who became
incarnate for our redemption, in His divine nature took the likeness of a
servant, by the dispensation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the faith of the Church of Alexandria, by which we are all
adorned, both we, and the God-fearing bishops and clergy, and the monks, and all
the people of God. And the congregation of the people grows and multiplies
exceedingly in the Churches, while we are obedient to the apostle, who says,
&quot;If any man shall preach to you any other gospel than what we have
preached, let him be accursed.'<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p>&quot;But the cause of all these blessings so dear and acceptable to us, was
the election of thy Piety's Eminence, which <A NAME="p144"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|144</SPAN></A>
has been mentioned above ; and also the goodwill of the believing and
Christ-loving King Zeno, who consented to thine election. And he also, for the
sake of the unity of the people, and that we might be established in power and
in the truth, by what he wrote so faithfully in the Henotikon, anathematised all
the rash thoughts and words of Chalcedon and the Tome of Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;And we consent to this same document; and we preach it, by word of
mouth and by writing, to the believing nations; as also our ever-memorable and
holy brother and fellow-minister Acacius was seen to hold and teach until his
death, when the Alexandrians testified to us his true faith, as thy Holiness is
also persuaded. For it is right for the Christ-loving king, not only to subdue
enemies, and to set the Barbarian races beneath his feet; but also to expose the
snares of these intellectual enemies, and to cause the true faith to shine upon
the believing people. For thy Holiness has risen up and bloomed forth for us
like the plant of peace. And this is the gift of the believing king to us, by
the will of God, Who chose him before, as we have already said. And, therefore,
we are delighted at this, that such a good priest should arise and appear for
the believing nations. May God keep him, and may He adorn him with the heavenly
crown by His own rich Hand, as we hope and pray that he may be found walking in
the whole way of the truth, in the footsteps of the holy fathers, a believing
chosen priest, by the mercy of our Saviour Christ, through Whom, to the Father,
with the Holy Spirit, be glory for evermore!</p>
<p>&quot;But we welcomed affectionately the bearers of the letter of thy
Righteousness the excellent Longinus the presbyter and Andrew the deacon; and we
now send them back in peace to thy Holiness.&quot;</p>
<p>But Athanasius <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A><i> </i>also wrote in the same
strain, two years afterwards, to Palladius, who was Peter's successor in
Antioch, expressly anathematising the Synod, and quoting freely from the
Henotikon.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> <A NAME="p145"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|145</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And John <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A><i> </i>was appointed as the
successor of Athanasius; and when anyone would ask him to give an anathema of
the Synod and the Tome in writing, he would give it cheerfully and without fear.
Now Flavian, who was the successor of Palladius in Antioch, sent Solomon, a
presbyter of his Church, to this John of Alexandria. And Solomon asked John for
a letter to Flavian, concerning the concord in the faith. But John would not
consent to do this for him, until he should receive from him a sworn statement
that he would send him a letter from Flavian in which there would be an anathema
of the Synod and the Tome. And John, his namesake and successor, was believing
and acting in like manner. . Now after Zeno had reigned seventeen years, and
matters had been thus carried on in the Church; and also the tyrants Basiliscus
and Marcus had risen up against him, and been driven out, as we have related
above; and again, Illus and Leontius and Euprepius had rebelled against him and
been slain in the East; and again, in his days, one Theodoric a tyrant had taken
captives from Thrace and many other places, and had gone to Rome and subdued it,
because Odoacer the Anti-Caesar there fled before him to Ravenna a city of
Italy; Zeno died in the year eight hundred and two, according to the Greek mode
of reckoning.</p>
<p>And Anastasius, his successor, received the kingdom on the fourth day of the
Great Week; when Euphemius was the bishop of Constantinople; and Flavian of
Antioch; and Athanasius of Alexandria; and Sallustius, the successor of
Martyrius, of Jerusalem ; and Felix, the successor of Simplicius, of Rome.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VII</b></p>
<p align="center">THE SEVENTH CHAPTER TELLS WHO WERE THE CHIEF PRIESTS IN THE
DAYS OF ZENO</p>
<p>But the following were the chief priests in the days of Zeno. In Rome, after
Hilarus, Simplicius, the author of the <A NAME="p146"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|146</SPAN></A>
letter to Zeno respecting John the liar, who was ejected from Alexandria; and
after him Felix, who was still living when Anastasius became the emperor.</p>
<p>In Alexandria, Timothy the Great, who was recalled from banishment; and
Timothy Salophiaciolus; and John, who was forthwith ejected; and Peter; and his
successor, Athanasius.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Anastasius; and Martyrius; and Sallustius.</p>
<p>In Antioch, Martyrius, who was ejected ; and Julian ; and Stephen; and the

Palladius ; and Flavian, his successor, who was ejected in the days of

and Euphemius, his successor, who was ejected in the days of Anastasius.</p>
<p>But in this sixth Book and in the fifth Book preceding it, which have been
translated concisely and briefly (so to speak) in contracted style, for the
information of the Syriac reader, from the Greek History of Zachariah the
Rhetorician; which he wrote thus far, in protracted style, after the manner of
Greek amplification; there is a period of seventeen years, comprising only the
life of the Emperor Zeno.</p>
