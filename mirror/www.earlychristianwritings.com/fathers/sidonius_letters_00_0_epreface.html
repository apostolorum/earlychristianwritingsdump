<p align="center"><b>Sidonius Apollinaris, Letters. Tr. O.M. Dalton (1915):
Preface to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">Sidonius Apollinaris was a Roman aristocrat of the 5th century
AD.&nbsp; Born around 431 AD, he held estates in Gaul.&nbsp; He pursued an
official career under the emperors Avitus (a kinsman), Majorian, and Anthemius,
rising to be Prefect of Rome.&nbsp; But all these emperors were murdered in turn
by the sinister Ricimer, a barbarian general holding the highest office in the
state, that of Patrician, or Prime Minister.&nbsp; Ricimer ostensibly governed
in the Roman interest.&nbsp; In reality he pursued no interest but his own, and
his murder of the capable Majorian ensured the collapse of the
empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">As Roman rule weakened, the barbarians occupied more and more of
Gaul.&nbsp; Sidonius had returned to Gaul under Anthemius.&nbsp; Like so many
other aristocrats, he had reluctantly become Bishop in his local town, Clermont
in Arvernia.&nbsp;&nbsp; The advancing Visigoths under their king Euric moved
into the region; Sidonius helped organise resistance,since none of the Roman
forces paid for from the crushing taxation of the time were available to defend
them.&nbsp; But
after enduring a siege, he found to his appalled horror that the imperial
government was plotting to betray the Arvernians, some of their strongest
supporters.&nbsp; (His outraged letter to Bishop Graecus, one of the
go-betweens, is included in this edition).&nbsp; And so it proved.&nbsp;
Sidonius himself was imprisoned by Euric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">States prepared to sell their own allies to appease an advancing
enemy have little prospect of survival.&nbsp; In less than a dozen years, Roman
rule had ceased everywhere in the West; the consequence of its rulers placing
themselves in the power of those whose loyalties were ultimately
non-Roman.&nbsp; Sidonius lived long enough to outlive the last emperor, Julius
Nepos.&nbsp; He died, sometime after 480, and is canonised as a saint.</p>

<p align="left">Sidonius left two works; a set of 24 <i>Carmina</i> or <i>Poems</i>,
and 9 books of Letters.&nbsp; This translation, in two volumes contains only the
letters; both are available in the Loeb text.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Poems include
verse panegyrics of all three emperors, and have considerable historical
value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Dalton included an introduction of almost 200 pages; nearly a
third of the book.&nbsp; It seems permissable to wish that he had included the
poems instead.&nbsp; This preface has been written so that the general reader
may orient himself first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
