NEW EDITION, REVISED THROUGHOUT WITH A<BR>


NEW SUPPLEMENT OF 25,000 ADDITIONAL<BR>


WORDS AND PHRASES.</b></p>
<p align="center">-----------------</p>
<p>


The Appendices comprise a Pronouncing Gazetteer of the World, Vocabularies of Scripture, Greek, Latin, and English Proper Names, a &quot;Dictionary of the Noted Names of Fiction, a Brief History of the English Language, a Dictionary of Foreign Quotations, Words, Phrases, Proverbs, &amp;c., a Biographical Dictionary with 10,000 names, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>


Dr. MURRAY, <I>Editor of the </I>'<I>Oxford English Dictionary; </I>says:----'In this its latest form, and with its large Supplement and numerous appendices, it is a wonderful volume, which well maintains its ground against all rivals on its own lines. The 'definitions,' or more properly, 'explanations of meaning' in 'Webster' have always struck me as particularly terse and well-put; and it is hard to see how anything better could be done within the limits.'</p>
<p>


Professor JOSEPH WRIGHT, M.A., Ph.D., D.C.I., LL.D., <I>Editor of the </I>'<I>English Dialect Dictionary' </I>says:----'The new edition of &quot;Webster's International Dictionary&quot; is undoubtedly the most useful and reliable work of its kind in any country. No one who has not examined the work carefully would believe that such a vast amount of lexicographical information could possibly be found within so small a compass.'</p>
<p>


Rev. JOSEPH WOOD, D.D., <I>Head Master of Harrow, </I>says:----'I have always thought very highly of its merits. Indeed, I consider it to be far the most accurate English Dictionary in existence, and much more reliable than the &quot;Century.&quot; For daily and hourly reference, &quot;Webster&quot; seems to me unrivalled.'</p>
