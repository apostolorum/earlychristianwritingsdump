people of Babylon and Seleucia: how Phrates was succeeded on the throne by
King Mithridates surnamed The Great, who made war on the Armenians. Then the
origins and geography of Armenia are recalled. How, after a succession of several different kings in Parthia, Orodes came to
the throne, who destroyed Crassus and occupied Syria through his son Pacorus. He
[Orodes] was succeeded by Phrates, who went to war both with Antony and with Tiridates.
Scythian affairs are added to this. The Asian kings of the Tochari, and the demise of the Saraucae.</p>

<p>This translation has been made from Otto Seel's text, and J.C.Yardley's
excellent and very readable translation consulted (and deferred to).&nbsp; This translation is
made more literal, and hence somewhat less readable than Yardley.&nbsp; Words in
square brackets make the sentence more like English.</p>

<p><A NAME="#1"></A>1.&nbsp;I have not tried to translate 'prologus' -- summary
would be a good choice.&nbsp; It is not a table of contents in the modern sense,
as books at this period (ca. 20AD) had the book as the smallest unit of
composition.&nbsp; Chapters, in the modern sense, do not seem to occur until the
6th century AD.</p>

<p><A NAME="#2"></A>2.&nbsp;Lit. 'volumen' -- a roll.</p>

<p><A NAME="#3"></A>3.&nbsp;I saw no point in translating 'imperium' as
'rule' or 'empire', just for the sake of it.</p>

<p><A NAME="#4"></A>4.&nbsp;Y. omits the sentence up to this point, for some
reason.</p>

<p><A NAME="#5"></A>5.&nbsp;Y.'s very attractive rendering of 'occupatis
angustiis'.</p>

<p><A NAME="#6"></A>6.&nbsp;'Praefectus': rendered 'satrap' by Y.</p>
