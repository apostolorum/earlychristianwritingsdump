<h3 align="center">THE TENTH BOOK</h3>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER I&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="center">THE FIRST CHAPTER</p>
<p>When <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Severus and Anthimus, the believing chief
priests, had been driven out by the king, as mentioned in the ninth Book above,
and had withdrawn from the royal city on the arrival of Agapetus of Rome, who
soon after died at the end of the month of March in the year fourteen,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
as also did Sergius the <i>archiatros, </i>who brought him, then Ephraim, who
held the see of Antioch in the East, was strengthened and invigorated, and upon
his sending a message [to the king] (?) <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> there was
sent&nbsp; <A NAME="p298"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|298</SPAN></A> [a force of Romans] (?)
<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and Clement[inus the tribune (?): and] he received
orders in the year fifteen <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> to traverse the
Eastern jurisdiction and to go all round it, and himself to give admonition in
words, while Clementinus was to use force to make the inhabitants of the cities
in the East accept the Synod, as had been done by the natives of Italy, the land
of Rome. And this same Ephraim, accompanied by Clementinus, went [to] Berrhoea
and Chalcis and Hierapolis and Batnae and Edessa, and to Sura and to Callinicus
and the rest of the frontier, and to Rhesaina and to Amida and to Constantia;
and he induced many persons to submit, some by words and by promising them the
friendship of the king, and some by fear of threats and also exile and
spoliation of goods and degradation from their ranks and exclusion from all
trades; and others they hunted and drove from country to country, among them the
monks, who were found approved in the faith and true believers in time of trial.
And, as the winter was a severe one, so much so that from the large and unwonted
quantity of snow the birds perished and . . . , there was distress . . . among
men . . . from the evil things. And <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> ... in
various countries . . . From the hill of Singara [in the land] of the Persians
they took (?)... John, the <A NAME="p299"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|299</SPAN></A>
believing [bishop] of Constantia, [by means of] a man named Cons[tantius (?)],
and he was imprisoned in A[n]t[i]o[ch] and afflicted and ... he would not change
but continued . . . until the beginning of the year one <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A><i>
</i>[in] prison [and there] ended [his life] . . . and they were expelled . . .
and lived in [various] countries ... [until] the year three.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
. . . Khos[r]u . . . and went up [to] S[ura] and Berrhoea and Anti[o]ch. Now
Theodosius of Alexandria was summoned by the king to come to him, and went up
with a few bishops from his jurisdiction; and he would in no wise accept the
Synod of Chalcedon, until in the year one <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> Paul
was appointed to the see. And, when Theodosius and the bishops who were with him
came before the king, their [arrival] was announced by letter<sup> </sup>to
Ephraim . . . thence . . . But The[odosius and those who were] with him
[appeared] before the king and . . . , and without . . . , and they were removed
. . . , and there they lived, and the queen was studious in showing them honour,
and no one [of] their acquaintances or other discreet men was prevented from
seeing them [or] ministering to them. . . . Now there went up ... in [the year
fif]teen,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> and also (?) . . . the king . . . much
. . . he told him about [a ... man] named But <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> .
. . , [who plotted] a rising in Dara in the summer of the year, who was put to
death. And he freed the king from distress of mind, but in what way I have not
sure enough information to state, and therefore keep silence. <A NAME="p300"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|300</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, because Paul who succeeded<i> </i>Th[eo]d[osius] (?) in the see . . . ,
he shut up ... <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> on account of zeal for the faith
[in] a bath and suffocated him; and this man's son he arrested and put in the
guard-house, that he might not make his father's death known. But it so happened
that he escaped and made his way to the queen, and through the believers who
knew his father he told the news of his fearful death. And on this account
Ephraim of Antioch was sent to Alexandria, and Abraham Bar Khili [accompanied
him]; and, as they passed through Palestine, they took with them a monk named
Zoilus. And they went to Alexandria and] investigated the action of Paul; and
they drove him from his see and enthroned Zoilus, a Synodite, in the city: and
in order to protect this man from the violence [of] the people of the city they
appointed Acacius Bar Eshkhofo <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> of Amida<sup> </sup>tribune
of the Romans there.</p>

  <p>THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE TENTH BOOK, CONCERNING THE DOINGS OF ABRAHAM <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
  [BAR KHILI AT AMIDA] <A NAME="p301"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|301</SPAN></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="smallish">(Here the MS. breaks off. The words in brackets I supply
from the headings in the introduction to this Book. The whole of this chapter
and the following are missing.)</p>
<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IV</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>FROM THE EPISTLE WRITTEN BY RABBULO TO GEMELLINUS, BISHOP OF PERRHE, ABOUT
  THOSE WHO INSULT THE MYSTERIES AND SUPPORT THEMSELVES UPON THEM LIKE COMMON
  BREAD <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;I <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> have heard that in your country of
Perrhe certain of the brethren, whose cloisters are not known, and others of the
distinguished archimandrites of the place, have falsely given out concerning
themselves the vain report that they do not eat bread, and have lyingly uttered
of themselves the empty boast that they do not drink water, and have asserted of
themselves that they abstain from wine. Accordingly I am afraid to mention that
I have heard that they insult the body and blood of Jesus, the Son of God; but,
since necessity constrains me, I will, as is right, be bold to say things which
are what these men are not afraid to do, who madly and without discrimination
offer the body and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, that is, the holy and
hallowing body which they have received and the living and life-giving blood
which they have drunk. These men, whom I do not know how to name, are said
impiously to satisfy the constant wants of their natural hunger and thirst upon
it, and it is impossible for them of their own will to go <A NAME="p302"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|302</SPAN></A>
even one day without the oblation, which is their sustenance; but continually
every day a large quantity of food is supplied by the sacrament. And for this
reason also they richly<sup> </sup>leaven the particle which they prepare, and
diligently dress<sup> </sup>it, and carefully seethe it, that it may serve them
for food, and it is not treated as the mystery of the body of Christ, symbolised
in unleavened bread. And for the rest it is said that, whenever hard pressed,
they even offer common unconsecrated bread over one another's hands and eat it.
And it is said to be their practice, when walking from one place to another or
going on a long journey, to satisfy their natural hunger and thirst on the same
body of our Lord two or three times in one day, and, as soon as they have
reached<sup> </sup>their destination, in the evening they are said again to
offer the oblation and partake of it as if fasting; nay, even in the holy days
of the fast of Lent they presume to act in this manner without fear of God and
without shame before men. And men who, as they say, refrain from bread and water
every day are found to eat the holy bread and drink the blessed wine on such
glorious days, on which even the vile themselves abstain.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Spirit that is in me, holy brother ours, bears witness for me
that I tremble to write to your reverence all that I have heard about them,
because my heart could not really believe it: and I would it had been possible
for you to have known what I wish to learn <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
without an epistle or a word from me, and for these same men to have received
correction from your uprightness, because neither did I wish that either you, my
lord, or they should know what is rumoured about <A NAME="p303"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|303</SPAN></A>
them. Do not then think yourself or let them suppose that it is because I
believe the evil report about them that I write these same things to you
concerning them; but, being still in doubt, I say to others also that it is
impossible that such a great sin should be committed by men who have ever been
baptized in Christ. For they say that, as soon as they have performed the
sacrament in the paten, they lightly (?) eat<sup> </sup>as much as they want of
it, while the cup of the blood each of them tempers with hot water, whenever
they can, like mixed wine and drinks it, and again fills it and gives it to his
neighbour; so that owing to the quantity of wine which they drink under the name
of the sacrament they are often obliged actually to spit it out of their mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;O what transcendent impiety, if it is the fact that these men,
despising their life, have converted the revered vessels of the sacrament, which
on account of the mysteries contained in them even for spiritual heavenly
purposes men fear to approach boldly, into vessels of service for their belly,
and did not even so much as remember the punishment which Belt'shatstsar, the
heathen king, received and was reproved! For, because in the vessels of the
service of God he purposed to insult God like a rebel by using them in a carnal
fashion, the likeness of a palm of a hand that wrote was sent from on high to
write on the wall of his house the righteous sentence of condemnation for his
presumption: though how indeed can the vessels of service of the temple in
Jerusalem be compared to the glorious vessels of service of the body and blood
of the Son of God? For neither is the showbread of the priests of Israel in any
way worthy to be compared to the glory of the transcendent mystery; and, if so
be any man likens the bread of the table, which David ate when he was hungry, to
the life-giving body of God the Word, we ought to look upon him as <A NAME="p304"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|304</SPAN></A>
a foolish man who does not distinguish the body and blood of the Lord from
showbread: wherefore he is an offender against the body and blood of our Lord.
For the showbread scarcely cleansed a bodily pollution, even when baptisms of
various kinds were combined with it and observance of this and that: but this
life-giving body and blood of our Lord Jesus not only purged and hallowed the
sin of the soul and of the body in those who received it with faith, but also
caused God to be in us, and that by His Spirit, as we are in Him by our body; <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A><i>
</i>for, 'Whoso eateth My body and drinketh My blood,' says the Son of God, 'he
is in Me and I in him, and I will raise him up at the last day.' <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
In another way again we may understand the greatness of this service, which is a
new one, delivered to us by God the Word, from the hard and severe punishment
which Paul pronounced against those who have enjoyed it, beyond that received by
those who offend against the old service introduced by Moses; for he said, 'If
so be he who transgressed against Moses' law died without mercy at the mouth of
two or three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment will he be worthy who hath
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of His covenant as
that of an ordinary man, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of His grace,
wherewith we were sanctified.' <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> Who is there,
therefore, who is so mad as to compare this bread of life, which came down from
heaven by virtue of its union with God the Word and gives life to the world, to
the showbread with its earthly seasoning? But the opinion of anyone who thinks
or acts in this manner is manifest and is, moreover, clearly apparent, for he
who thus madly receives it reckons it to be in fact common bread, as he sees it,
and does not believe the Son who says, 'The bread which I will give is My body,
which is given for the life of the world;' <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> for
it follows that not only is the bread in the body of Christ, as is seen by them,
but in the bread is the body of the invisible God, <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
as we believe and <A NAME="p305"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|305</SPAN></A> receive the body
<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A><i> </i>not to satisfy our bellies but to heal
our souls. For<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> those who eat the holy bread in
faith do in it and with it eat the living body of God the Sanctifier, and those
who eat it without faith receive sustenance, as with other things necessary for
the body. For, if the bread is carried off and eaten by enemies by violence,
they eat common bread, because those that eat it have not faith, which perceives
its sweetness: for the bread is tasted by the palate, but the virtue which is
hidden in the bread is tasted by faith. For that which is eaten is not only the
body of our Saviour, as we said a little before, but whatever is mingled with
it, as we believe: for the virtue <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> which is not
eaten is mingled with the edible bread, and to those that partake of it becomes
one with it, even as the hidden heavens mingle with the visible water, and from
them a new birth is born. For the Spirit secretly hovers over the visible water,
so that from it a likeness of the heavenly Adam is born anew. <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
And, just as in the visible water, in order that it may impart to all who are
outwardly baptized in it, there is invisible life, so also in the external bread
food is hidden and concealed, of which everyone who rightly partakes obtains
immortal life; and we believe the saying of Paul, that those who receive it
slightingly obtain from it injury to soul and body and are not profited, even if
they are reckoned among the believers. And would that they obeyed the saying of
the apostle, who says, 'And let a man examine himself, and then let him eat of
that bread and drink of that cup; and he that eateth of it when he is not fit
for it eateth and drinketh condemnation to himself! <sup><A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
</sup>And the same proclaims by his words that it is on account of our enmity
against the body and blood that the various infirmities <A NAME="p306"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|306</SPAN></A>
and unexpectedly sudden death have befallen us by a righteous judgment. &quot;By
reason of this happen most of the diseases and sicknesses, and the fate of those
who fall asleep suddenly. But, if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged.
But, when our Lord judges us, He gives us a discipline, that we may not be
condemned with the world.&quot; <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A><i> </i>And, if
those who were in the fixed days of service were now to partake, they would
receive one substance only of the body of life. If it be done without the sorrow
of repentance, and men do not receive it in faith with reverent fear, even if
they do not also commit a deed contrary to their faith, then they are guilty of
the body and blood of the Lord, as Paul said, because they do not discern the
Lord's body. What punishment can be too severe for this, too great even to be
applied to the judgment of those who approach it without fear and do not receive
an aliment of faith, but a thing necessitated by their hunger? O, what insolence
is this, to which the divine retribution is not equal, if it slays the man! Who
does not fear even heaven, when men satisfy the needs of their bodies on a coal
of devouring fire, as if it were common bread? Who is not frightened at this
statement, that of the coal on which our life depends, that which the seraph
revealed to us, grasping it with a fiery forceps in his hand, to signify the
sublimity of our mystery, and, while meditating upon it with reverence,
approached to take hold of it, of this these men eat to satiety and without
fear? And before the body which is given for the life of the world their heart
does not quake and they are not afraid, and their hands do not tremble or shake,
and their knees do not slip that they should fall, when they eat it for the
support of bodily life. And perhaps we ought to say that our Lord also in His
full knowledge of all times knew the deed of these men; and for this reason,
after they had eaten of the legal passover and were satisfied, then blessed the
bread and gave it to His disciples, in order that these men might not say that,
after He had blessed, they were satisfied (but, after they were satisfied, He
blessed, when the Master and His disciples took a small particle of it); and
over the cup He said, <A NAME="p307"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|307</SPAN></A> 'Take, drink
ye all of it,' that they might understand by this that it was of this small cup
of which twelve persons drank.</p>
<p>&quot;And it must needs be said that they thought of themselves that they
would attract the admiration of simple persons (?)<sup> </sup>by their
abstinence from bread and wine, and did not understand that the laughter of the
intelligent would defeat and overcome them, and would fall upon their heads,
prevailing over the praise of ignorant persons like them. Those who are like
them have in all this unpardonable sin accepted for themselves glory from
perishing men, even though it did not result to them. It is not fit that they
should be named men, but, in justice, they should be named rabid dogs: for the
sign of rabid dogs is this, that they suddenly attack the body of their master
to eat it.</p>
<p>&quot;And a man who has forbidden himself bread ought to be empty and not
taste anything until the time appointed for him. And this is well known that,
when Saul enacted that no one should taste anything on the day of battle until
the evening, then Jonathan, because he tasted some honey on the end of his rod,
incurred the penalty of death, if it had not been for the violence of the people
until he was safe. For 'the foundation of the life of man is bread and water,'
says Jesus Bar Asira, the son of Simeon. (Under the name of bread he extended
his saying to all food.) And they say of these men that, after they have
received the oblation in the morning, and partaken of it yet again in the
evening, then they lightly (?) <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> eat other food
and lightly (?) feed on dressed beet and pulse.<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
They are said to fill themselves on cheese instead of bread; they are, moreover,
in the habit of eating fish with all their pleasant taste; they sate themselves
largely <A NAME="p308"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|308</SPAN></A> on delicious fruit, and
they delight in it particularly when dry, besides honey-combs and egg-cakes.
And, because the heat of the wine which they drink under the name of the
Sacrament inflames them more with thirst, all through the summer season they are
said regularly to drink the milk of sheep and goats;<sup> </sup>and this again
they have done of set purpose, for they have also discovered that the moisture
and coolness of milk are found to temper the perpetual burning which results
from the wine in their excess. Now, because of these things, and by reason of
them, there is in due season uttered, as it shall be spoken, against them also
the righteous reproof of God which He pronounced to Eli because of his sons:
'Behold! I have given you all the good things of the earth, that ye might use
them without sin; even as for them I set apart all the offerings of the children
of Israel, that they might enjoy them without guilt. Wherefore have ye also
offended against My body and My blood, like those who wrought wickedness against
My sacrifices and against My offerings?' And, since the impiety of these men
against God has far surpassed the impiety of those others, which was committed
against the people, there has been fear and great trembling in case they should
suffer, lest also a punishment like that which went forth against those should
be pronounced against them. &quot; 'Wherefore,' thus said the Lord, the God of
Israel, 'I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should
minister before Me for ever'; but now the Lord saith, 'Be it far from Me! for
them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly
esteemed.' &quot; <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> You see how He rejected them
for ever from the priesthood, and made them outcasts and aliens from His house.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what shall I say of men who are not in unison <A NAME="p309"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|309</SPAN></A>
with the prophets of the Old Testament, nor yet resemble <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A><i>
</i>the apostles of the New? For they ought at least to have learned from the
chief of the apostles, Peter, what his food was; since he has plainly stated in
what his bodily life consisted. For, when his chosen disciple, Clement, asked
him to allow him to be his only minister, he spoke thus to him, praising his
zeal and jesting at his sustenance: 'Why! Who is strong enough for all this
ministry? Are we not continually eating bread and olives? or perhaps it may be
that sometimes there may also be a cabbage.' <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
Moreover, have they not also received a good tradition from Paul, the preacher
of truth? For, behold! he also out of the greatness of his need sent and sold
his tunic, and with the price of it it is written that they bought bread only
and brought it to him with a cabbage, <A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> that by
his action he might lay down a law for us also, as in his saying, 'If we have
food and raiment, that is enough for us.' <sup><A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> </sup>And,
if it is a small thing for them to liken themselves to the apostles, the
baptizers of the world, let them imitate even the Lord of the apostles, the
Maker of the worlds, and of all that is in them; unless, perhaps, even the human
dispensation of our God is contemptible and vile in their eyes. For, behold! as
to our Lord, He has everywhere shown us that He ate bread; and the bread too was
not of wheat, but it was of barley, and so were the seven other loaves, which
were fruitful and multiplied at His word, and 4000 men ate of them and left
seven baskets actually (?) full of bread. And, when He ate the passover with His
disciples, unleavened bread was set before Him. And also after His resurrection
from the dead He ate bread with His disciples for forty days, that the
dispensation of our Lord and His fleshly assumption of a body<sup> </sup>might
be believed by them, as they themselves wrote: 'Jesus went in and out among
them.' <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> And the house of Cleopas, <A NAME="p310"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|310</SPAN></A>
because He did not wish them to recognise Him<i> </i>while walking with them in
the way, He blessed over bread and brake it for them within the house, and then
they knew Him.</p>
<p>&quot;But these men, as I hear, do not follow in their deeds those that err,
nor yet are they in concord with the truth in their actions; for they are not
circumcised like the Marcionists, neither are they ascetic after the manner of
Christians. For, behold! they are not like those deniers of the truth who eat
only pulse or bread, but do not presume to commit a lie at their oblations,
neither yet do they resemble us believers who eat common bread in moderation and
receive the support of our true life separately.</p>
<p>&quot;Why have these gluttons not trained themselves, so that cheap things
only might be enough for them? And why have these guzzlers not accustomed
themselves to repel the hunger of their belly with something mean and vile? And
wherefore do they not eat ordinary, simple, common bread only? But it is plain
that it is in order that they may not afflict themselves. But, if they really
wish to afflict their bodies, let them not sate themselves, but eat bread only.
And, behold! they are wasted and shrunk and reduced to weakness. But it is plain
and manifest that these men do not struggle with their bodies, nor yet do they
wrestle with Satan; but for the sake of vain glory they exercise themselves in
the tricks of their evil devices, and not in the afflictions of
asceticism.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE FIFTH CHAPTER, CONCERNING THE DEDICATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH EPHRAIM OF
  ANTIOCH PERFORMED, AND THE SYNOD OF THE BISHOPS OF HIS JURISDICTION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ephraim,<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> who was chief priest in Antioch,
rebuilt from its foundations the round-shaped church in Antioch and the four <i>triklinia
</i>adjoining it. And, when he performed the consecration of it, he assembled
one hundred and thirty-two bishops from his jurisdiction in the year one; <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
and on the occasion of the dedication of the church he received a contribution
from each one of them, such as he pleased, on a lavish scale. And he confirmed
the Synod of Chalcedon in a document which the bishops whom he had assembled
were required to sign; and they anathematised the holy Severus, the believing
patriarch, and everyone who agrees with him and does not accept the Synod.</p>
<p>But God, who makes judgment for the. oppressed, after a short time roused up

prophet, who said, &quot;The Assyrian is the rod of Mine anger and the whip
wherewith I scourge: against a profane people will I send him, and against a
peevish people will I give him a charge, to lead away captives and to take the

Antioch, as described in the following chapter.<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A></p>

Antioch and Arzanene and Mesopotamia, and gradually to the land of the Persians

(?) with the scourge and happened to recover and not die trembled and shook: and
it was known that it was a scourge from Satan, who was ordered by God to destroy

<p>And on account of the distress and scanty numbers of the pastors among the

who consecrated and ordained priests, and that from the year one down to this

the Persians belonged to the opposite party (?), and they were assailed by

trees, in the year nine,<A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A> and there was a famine
which destroyed soul and body, and it was followed by emaciation such that a man
ate 10 lbs. of bread at one time and whatever other kinds of food he could get
with it through greediness and hunger. And he became swollen and inflated from
the food, but was not satisfied, but was hungry and greedy for food, and asked
for bread to fill his belly, and so he died.</p>

make no doubt that they are taken from our author. In general I follow Michael,

<p><A NAME="#50"></A>50.&nbsp;<i><sup>6</sup> </i>&quot;The southern part&quot;
is only in Jac. Edess.</p>
<p><A NAME="#51"></A>51.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Mich. and Greg. afterwards relate the
capture of Antioch and Callinicus over again. As this second account occurs in
similar words in &quot;Dionysius&quot; (Cod. Syr. Vat. 162, fol. 71), who writes
out John of Ephesus, and is absent in Jac. Edess., it is almost certainly
derived from John, a fact which strongly confirms the previous conclusion that
the account in the text is derived from our author.</p>
<p><A NAME="#52"></A>52.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Greg. (p. 80) also quotes a passage
relating to the plague as from Zachariah; but only the last sentence of this is
identical with Mich.'s quotation, the rest being identical with a passage quoted
by Mich. from Jo. Eph. It is clear, therefore, that either Gregory has erred or
his text is corrupted.</p>
<p><A NAME="#53"></A>53.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Ezek. vii. 17.</p>
<p><A NAME="#54"></A>54.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> This passage is written in the margin
of 9. 13 in Cod. Rom., where it is printed by Mai (p. 358) as part of the text
(see p. 242, note l).</p>
<p><A NAME="#55"></A>55.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Greg. &quot;Libya.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#56"></A>56.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> The close correspondence of this
account of the expedition against Edessa with the heading of ch. 9 seems to show
that it is derived from our author. Jac. Edess., indeed, inserts the capture of
Petra between the Armenian campaign and the expedition to Edessa, but only by a
slip, for the following sentence, &quot; and from that time the Romans were
attacking it&quot; etc. (see ch. 13), must refer to Petra, not to Edessa, as is
proved by the sense and by a comparison with Mich.</p>
<p><A NAME="#57"></A>57.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> In Jac. Edess. only.</p>
<p><A NAME="#58"></A>58.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> &quot;And made an attack&quot; is in
Jac. Edess. only.</p>
<p><A NAME="#59"></A>59.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> That this passage is derived from our
author is shown by the use of the indictional years, which is not found in Jo.
Eph. Moreover, according to our author's own peculiar fashion the numerals are
given in Greek.</p>
<p><A NAME="#60"></A>60.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> &quot;Of Singara &quot; is added by
Greg.</p>
<p><A NAME="#61"></A>61.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> 538-545.</p>
<p><A NAME="#62"></A>62.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> This sentence (not in Greg.) is
extremely obscure and probably corrupt. The real meaning seems to be that many
Monophysites had been carried off by the Persians.</p>
<p><A NAME="#63"></A>63.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Greg. adds &quot;a simple man.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#64"></A>64.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> In Mich. this clause is applied to
Theodore, but is followed by the words &quot;This is my lord James
Burd''oyo,&quot; which seem to be a gloss intended to point out that they really
belong to James. After this Greg. inserts &quot;and they ordained him
oecumenical metropolitan.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#65"></A>65.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Mich. &quot;Active in his journeying,
and travelled like a courier.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#66"></A>66.&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Greg. adds, &quot;and he began to go
round the countries of the East and to give ordination to the orthodox, showing
himself in the dress of a beggar, and chiefly on the roads from fear of the
persecution.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#67"></A>67.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> That this passage comes from our
author appears from the juxtaposition of these two events, the campaign in
Lazica and the famine, as in the headings above, and from the use of the
indictional reckoning with the numeral in Greek; see note below.</p>
<p><A NAME="#68"></A>68.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> So Mich. Jac. Edess. has
&quot;took.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="#69"></A>69.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Here Jac. Edess. interpolates the
attack on Edessa (see ch. 11, note).</p>
<p><A NAME="#70"></A>70.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> 546. The translator of Mich., who
alone records the date, has ..., ''in the district of Hanata&quot;; but no such
place is known, and I have no doubt that it is a misunderstanding of ...<i>, </i>which
our author transliterates as ... at p. 249, 1. 7, 12; p. 258, 1. 9, 1.</p>
<p><A NAME="#71"></A>71.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The heading and the latter portion of
the chapter are in Cod. Rom. The first paragraph, which seems to be derived from
the same source, I supply from Mich. and Greg. (pp. So, 81). A portion of the
Syriac Michael containing this paragraph and the description of Rome in the next
chapter has been edited by Prof. Guidi <i>(Bull. della Commiss. Arch. di Roma, </i>xix.
p. 61 ff.).</p>
<p><A NAME="#72"></A>72.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup><i> </i>546. This was the twentieth of
Justinian, and the fact that the same misreckoning is found twice in 12. 4 and
once in 12. 5 tends to show that this sentence is derived from our author.</p>

have existed in our author's original text, and I therefore do not emend. ...</p>
<p><A NAME="#94"></A>94.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> This word (...) generally means
&quot;public baths&quot;; but the translation in the text accords with <i>Notit.

<p><A NAME="#96"></A>96.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Here 12,154 adds, &quot;These are
exclusive of many things which we have not set down here. And these things the
author set down while weeping for the city, because in his time the barbarians
entered it and sacked it.&quot; This MS. omits the sentences containing corrupt
or difficult words, as well as the introductory and concluding sentences. Mich.
(Arab. fol. 185 <i>r</i>) has, in place of the concluding sentence, &quot;Verily
for the sack of this great city, which was completely burnt at this time by a
barbarian people, Justinian the king sorrowed exceedingly, and all the magnates
of the kingdom clothed themselves in mourning. And in those days the king's
sorrow was increased by the death of the queen, the blessed Theodora, who
departed in the twentieth year of the reign of Justinian, which is the year
eight hundred and fifty-nine of the Greeks, and he gave a large quantity of gold
on behalf of her soul.&quot; Greg. (p. 81) has the same in a shorter form.</p>
