<P>
THE Manuscript from which the materials for the present volume have been chiefly derived, is one of those which were obtained by Archdeacon Tattam from the Syrian convent in the desert of Nitria in the year 1843. It is now numbered 14,658 amongst the Additional Manuscripts in the British Museum. Several leaves were added in 1847 from fragments subsequently acquired by M. Pacho;<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><I> </I>and four more were again supplied from other fragments procured also by him from the same source in the year 1850. At present the volume consists of one hundred and eighty-eight leaves. Originally it must have had more than two hundred and twenty; for the last gathering as it now stands is numbered the twenty-second, and each gathering consisted of ten leaves. It is imperfect both at the beginning and the end, has suffered mutilations in several parts of the volume, and some of the leaves have been much stained by oil. It is written in a large bold hand in two columns: the headings of chapters and the titles of separate works arc distinguished by red letters. It appears to have been transcribed about the sixth or seventh century of our era.&nbsp;&nbsp;

BARDESAN.
</h3>
<P>
The first work printed from this Manuscript is the celebrated Treatise of Bardesan on Fate, said to have been addressed to the Emperor Marcus Antoninus, commonly known as
<A NAME="pii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ii</SPAN></A>
Marcus Aurelius; although, with the document now complete before us, we find no intimation of its having been so addressed. Eusebius calls it, [Greek]:<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Jerome, copying him, writes, &quot;Clarissimus et fortissimus liber quem, Marco Antonino de fato tradidit.<SUP><A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> </SUP>Theodoretus speaks of the author in the following terms:
[Greek].<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Epiphanius gives the same account in a rather extended form, supplying also the name of the person to whom Bardesan chiefly addressed himself in this
Dialogue: [Greek]<I>.</I><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><I> </I>Eusebius, in his <I>Ecclesiastical History, </I>speaks of the author thus : [Greek];<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A><I> </I>and again, in his <I>Preparatio Evangelica, </I>he prefaces an extract from the work now before
us with  these words:   [Greek]<I>.</I><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> He then  quotes the long extracts which I have printed, pp. 8-10 and 16-32.
Photius,   writing  of Diodorus,   Bishop   of Tarsus,   has the  following words:  [Greek]
<A NAME="piii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|iii</SPAN></A>
[Greek].<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> And again,  [Greek].<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
</P>
<P>
The title, indeed, of the work in this volume is <I>Book of the Laws of Countries, </I>and the name of the person who is introduced as having written down the dialogue is Philip (see pages 5 and 7); but it is evident that it is the same treatise as that alluded to by all these writers whose words have been now quoted. It is a dialogue. Bardesan takes the leading part in it: his discourse is addressed to his companions, one of whom is named Avida, or Abida. The subject-matter is on Fate. It affirms the precise doctrine which is attributed to Bardesan's treatise. The author declares himself to be fully acquainted with the science of Chaldaean astrology, and gives abundant proof of the same; and, further, all those passages which have been quoted as extracts from Bardesan's treatise, are found in this. Moreover, it is written in Syriac, in which most of his works were composed, although he was also well skilled in the Greek tongue, as Epiphanius
<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> informs us. There can be no doubt, therefore, that we have now in our hands, in the original language of the author, and in a
complete form, that celebrated Dialogue of Bardesan  on Fate, written about the middle of the second century,<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> which has been
<A NAME="piv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|iv</SPAN></A>
so often referred to by subsequent writers, but of which only a comparatively small portion has hitherto been known to us.
</P>
<P>
Eusebius has inserted two long extracts from this treatise in his <I>Praeparatio Evangelica, </I>probably from a Greek translation made by some of those friends of Bardesan, who, as the same author, in his <I>Ecclesiastical History, </I>as well as Theodoretus, informs us, translated his dialogues into Greek.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> I have given both of these passages in this volume, on the same page with the English translation. Besides the Greek version preserved by Eusebius, there is also a Latin translation of the second extract, contained in the <I>Recognitions, </I>falsely attributed to Clement of Rome, which were modified and done into Latin by Ruffinus about the year 400.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> I have printed this, as well as the Greek,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> in juxtaposition with my own English translation, in order that the reader may at one view be enabled to compare the three, and to note their variations as well as their agreement. I have likewise appended an extract from the second Dialogue of Caesarius, brother of Gregory of Nazianzum, in which, although the name of the author be not mentioned, much has been borrowed from that same part of Bardesan's dialogue which relates especially to the laws and habits of different nations. It may be interesting and useful to compare this also with the other versions, and with the original text.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<A NAME="pv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|v</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Author, Bardesan himself, so much has been already said by different writers,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> that the subject seems to have been exhausted; and I am not aware that I am able to bring any additional facts to light, beyond what is supplied by the treatise itself, now, after the lapse of many centuries, for the first time exhibited in its original integrity. I will therefore only quote a few passages relating to Bardesan and his opinions, which I have extracted from the famous reply of Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabug, to an anonymous writer who had impugned the opinions which he had put forth in an Epistle addressed to the monks.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> They are taken from one of the Nitrian Manuscripts obtained by Dr. Tattam in 1841, now in the British Museum, No. 12,164: [Syriac]
&quot;But thou hast not been mindful of thy instructor, Bardesan, whom his disciples celebrate in their books for his patience and polite answers to every man.&quot; fol. 125, b. [Syriac]
<A NAME="pvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vi</SPAN></A>&nbsp; &quot;Who so confesseth that boy which was  born   of the  Virgin, that her child is the Highest,  he assents to Bardesan.&quot;    f. 127, b.    [Syriac] &quot;Therefore this also, that 'the Antient of Eternity was a boy,' we have not taken this from Bardesan, but he has made use of it as a means of concealing his own error, and took it from the doctrine of the Church.&quot; f.164.
[Syriac] &quot;There are some of them who say, that he sent down the Word a body from heaven, as thou saidest just now, and didest assent to thy teacher Bardesan ..... Because thou hast not comprehended the mind of Bardesan, who assumeth the body of Christ to be from heaven.&quot; f. 171. b.

MELITON.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
</h3>
<P>
The second tract in this volume bears the title of &quot;An Oration of Meliton the Philosopher,&quot; addressed to Antoninus Caesar. Nor is there any thing contained in it, so far as I am competent to form an opinion, which in any way should lead
<A NAME="pvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vii</SPAN></A>
us to doubt of the correctness of this inscription, or to question the genuineness of the work.
</P>
<P>
It is true, as M. Bunsen states, that it appears to be entire, and yet does not contain that passage quoted by Eusebius
<SUP><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> </SUP>from the most famous of all Meliton's writings, his <I>Apology </I>to the Emperor Marcus Antoninus in defence of the persecuted Christians. Had indeed that learned ecclesiastical historian been fully acquainted with all the works of Meliton, and also distinctly stated that no other address had been made by him to any one bearing the name of Antoninus Caesar than that in which was contained the passage that he has quoted, it would then have been sufficiently evident that the work before us could not be by Meliton, if indeed it be, as it appears to me to be, complete, and not an abridgment or extract from a larger <I>Apology: </I>this, however, may seem to some to be uncertain.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> Eusebius himself, however, has given us to understand plainly that he did not profess to exhibit a full and exact account of all the writings, either of Meliton or of Apollinaris,<SUP><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> </SUP>but only of such as had come to his own knowledge. His silence, therefore, as the late venerable Dr. Routh
<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> has justly observed, is not of itself to be construed as an argument against the genuineness or authority of any work bearing a name not mentioned by him, if there be no positive external testimony against it, nor any internal evidence in the work itself which
<A NAME="pviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|viii</SPAN></A>
may render it doubtful or suspected. Maximus,<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> in his Preface to the writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, says that there were very many works which Eusebius omitted to notice, because they had never fallen into his hands. And as a case in point we may observe that Eusebius has not said one word respecting the <I>Apology </I>of Athenagoras, presented also to Marcus Antoninus about the same time, and containing many things in common with this address, and with the other Apologies offered to the Roman Emperors at that period.
</P>
<P>
There is  no reason why we  must suppose that Meliton
should not have written two Addresses to the Roman Emperor
as well as Justin Martyr, or that one of them might not have
escaped the knowledge of Eusebius, or at least have had no
mention of it made by him, as well as that of Athenagoras.
The <I>Apology </I>cited by Eusebius was probably amongst the latest,
or indeed the last of all the works <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> which Meliton wrote; and
internal evidence has led critics to conclude that it was presented to the Emperor Marcus Antoninus in the tenth year of
his reign, after the death of his associate in the Empire, Lucius
Aurelius Verus, about A.D. 169-70.    External  testimony  by
the author of the <I>Chronicon Paschale </I>attributes  it to the same
date, A.D. 169. <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> But the same writer, five years before, A.D.
<A NAME="pix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ix</SPAN></A>
164-65,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> speaks also of an <I>Apology </I>presented by Meliton to the Emperor. Unless, therefore, we assume that he was not sufficiently well and clearly informed, and has therefore given a confused account ---- an assumption for which the silence of Eusebius cannot afford sufficient grounds ---- we can hardly draw any other conclusion from his words than that Meliton presented two Apologetical addresses to the Roman Emperors ---- the one before us, which contains rather a defence of the true religion against the Polytheism, idolatry, and incorrect ideas of the Deity entertained by Pagans; and the other, as the extract preserved by Eusebius would lead us to infer, against the persecution of the Christians on account of their faith, Indeed the passage which the author of the <I>Chronicon Paschale </I>cites as from Meliton's <I>Apology, </I>and which, from its having been given before he mentions the later date, would lead us, if there were two, to refer it to the former, seems to be sufficiently near to be almost identified with expressions found in the work before us, if we bear in mind, that it must necessarily have undergone some change in phraseology, by the translation out of Greek into Syriac, and also suppose it not to have been intended for an exact and verbatim quotation,<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> but only as an allusion.
</P>
<P>
Judging merely from what we read in the Address itself, I should have been disposed to fix the date about four years earlier than that in which mention is first made of Meliton by the
<A NAME="px"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A>
<I>Chronicon Paschale, </I>either to the end of 160, or the beginning of 161, a short time before the death of Antoninus Pius, and probably when his health had sensibly begun to decline. Unless, indeed, the expression be intended as generally applicable to every one whose father is still alive, the words &quot;Be solicitous respecting thy father----so long as thy solicitude may be of avail to help him,&quot; would imply that Antoninus Pius was still surviving, although perhaps in a state to cause anxiety. In the inscription, Marcus Antoninus is designated Caesar, and not Autocrat, or Emperor. His being associated with Antoninus Pius, and taking a part in the administration of the empire, would be sufficient grounds for Meliton to address him; and in the words of the <I>Apology </I>cited by Eusebius, he alludes to the part which he took in the government: &quot;During the time that thou also with him wast governing every thing.&quot; The prospect of his early succession to be the head of the state, might also have prompted Meliton to offer his opinion as to the surest means of governing a realm in peace----by knowing the truth, and living conformably thereto. At the end of the Address he refers to the children of Antoninus. Of these he had several, both sons and daughters.<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
</P>
<P>
In forming an opinion from the internal evidence of the work, I cannot think with the Chevalier Bunsen, that &quot;it bears the stamp of a late and confused composition.&quot; It seems certain, indeed, that the writer alludes most clearly to the Second Epistle of St. Peter;<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> but inasmuch as I do not hold the same views as my very learned and dear friend respecting the authenticity
<A NAME="pxi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xi</SPAN></A>
of that Epistle,<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> I do not recognise, in the fact of its having been clearly alluded to in the work which we have now before us, any evidence of the &quot;lateness&quot; of the composition. As to the Address being &quot;confused,&quot; it does not seem to me in this respect to differ in its method from the rest of the Apologies of the second century; with which, indeed, it has very many things in common, even to some evident mistakes, such as that of confounding the Egyptian god Serapis with the Patriarch Joseph.<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> Some of the views of this writer as to the origin of Polytheism and idolatry in certain places are uncommon. They have probably been gathered from traditions at that time current in the East, but of which in these days very little is known.
</P>
<P>
I will not, however, pursue this subject further at present, but, committing the document into the hands of the reader, leave him to judge and draw his own conclusions for himself.
</P>
<P>
For an account of the other extracts attributed to Meliton, and the sources from which they have been gathered, I must refer to the notes in this volume.

AMBROSE.
</h3>
<P>
The short work bearing the inscription of <I>Hypomnemata, </I>and attributed to Ambrose, a &quot;chief man of Greece,&quot; is the same, with some modifications, as that known by the title of [Greek]<I>----</I>&quot;Oratio ad Gentiles,&quot; which, in several copies, is attributed to Justin Martyr, and indeed has been
<A NAME="pxii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xii</SPAN></A>
very generally received as his. Many, however, have doubted the authorship, and others have not hesitated to state their conviction that it bears internal evidence of being by a different hand from the undoubted work of Justin, <I>The Dialogue, with Trypho the Jew</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A></SUP> Assuming the authorship as it is given here to be correct, there seems to be an easy explanation why it might have come to be attributed to Justin, in the fact of its having been often classed in the same volume with his <I>Apologies, </I>which have in a great measure the same object in view; and thence having been supposed to be by Justin himself, a transition which the small bulk of the work may readily account for.
</P>
<P>
The Ambrose here mentioned as <I>a chief man of Greece, </I>and a <I>senator, </I>can hardly be understood to be any other than the friend and disciple of Origen, whom Epiphanius designates as one of those illustrious in the palaces of kings,<SUP><A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A></SUP> and whose wealth enabled him to supply his master with all the necessary expenses for completing his Hexaplar edition of the Scriptures,<SUP><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A></SUP> and who also himself suffered martyrdom for the Christian faith. Certainly the inscription of this tract and its contents would well concur with what we know of Ambrose.<SUP><A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A></SUP>
<A NAME="pxiii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiii</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</P>
<h3 align="center">
MARA, SON OF SERAPION.
</h3>
<P>
We have no information respecting this author beyond what is supplied in the letter itself addressed to his son. Mara, or as Assemani<sup>
<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A></sup> writes it in Latin, Maras, is not an uncommon appellation amongst the Syrians, and there have been many who have borne the name of Serapion<sup>
<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></sup>.
</P>
<P>
The author speaks of himself as one whose city had been ruined, and himself also taken and detained as prisoner in bonds by the Romans, together with others whom the victors treated in a tyrannical manner, as distrustful of their fidelity to the Roman government. He describes the misery of his friends and companions belonging to the city of Samosata, and the distresses which he and they suffered when they joined themselves together on the road to Seleucia. He alludes to the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jews as an act of divine vengeance for their having murdered Jesus; but he makes no direct mention of the name of Christ, and only designates him as the &quot;wise king,&quot; who, although put to death, still lived in the &quot;wise laws which he promulgated.&quot;
</P>
<P>
From these facts it is evident that the author wrote at a time when the Romans not long before had been making fresh conquests, or repressing rebellion in the parts of Syria about Samosata and Seleucia, and probably at a period when, on account of the persecution of the Christians, it would not have been prudent or safe to have spoken in more direct terms of Christ.
Comagena and its capital Samosata were taken by the Romans in the reign of Vespasian, A.D. 72, or two years after the capture
<A NAME="pxiv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xiv</SPAN></A>
of Jerusalem by Titus.<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> About twenty-three years later the persecution under Domitian began, A.D. 95.<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> There would be nothing therefore incongruous in assigning, from its internal evidence, the date of this Epistle to the close of the first century. Nor would the allusion to the catastrophe of Samos at all militate against this, if it be referred to the earthquake in the reign of Augustus, from which several of the neighbouring islands also suffered.<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
</P>
<P>
The mention, however, of that island having been covered with sand, as a punishment for the burning of Pythagoras, seems to me to have a direct reference to the Sibylline verses;&quot;<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
[Greek]&nbsp;
</P>
<P> I cannot therefore, in my own mind, come to any other conclusion than that this Epistle ought to be assigned to a period when the Sibylline verses were frequently cited, the age of Justin Martyr, Meliton, and Tertullian.<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> This date, too, will perhaps otherwise coincide quite as well with what is read in the letter as the former. The troubles to which the writer alludes as having befallen himself and his city will apply to those inflicted by the Romans upon the countries about the Tigris and Euphrates which had been excited to rebel against them
<A NAME="pxv"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|xv</SPAN></A>
by Vologeses, in the Parthian war under the command of Lucius Verus, A.D.
162-165.<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> I have not found the name of Samosata especially mentioned as having suffered more than other cities in this war; but it is stated that Seleucia was sacked and burned by the Romans, and five or six thousand slain.<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> The persecution under Marcus Antoninus followed very close upon this war, and as these facts equally agree with the allusions made in this Epistle of Mara, it may perhaps be nearer the truth to assign its date to the latter half of the second century rather than to the close of the first.
</P>
<P>
If indeed such be the period at which this Letter was written, there is no improbability in supposing, that the Serapion, to whom it is addressed, may be the same as he who succeeded Maximinus
<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> as eighth Bishop of Antioch, about the year 190, and who himself also wrote short epistles, similar to this in purpose and tendency, for which indeed his father's might have set him a pattern.<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>&nbsp;
