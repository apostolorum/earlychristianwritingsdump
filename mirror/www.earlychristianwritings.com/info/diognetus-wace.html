<DIV id=iii.iv.xvii title="Diognetus, Epistle to">
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.1><B>Diognetus, Epistle to.</B> The Greek writing known 
under this name was first printed in 1592 by Henricus Stephanus, along with a 
companion piece <I>To Greeks</I>, as hitherto unknown writings of Justin Martyr, 
taken by him from a single faded exemplar.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.2>In his edition, as in the transcript in his own 
handwriting extant at Leyden, the writing <I>To Greeks</I> was not prefixed, but 
appended to the writing <I>To Diognetus</I>; but in the MS. from which he took 
the pieces (identified by Gebhardt with that collated by Cunitz at Strasburg, 
where it perished in 1870) three works, each ascribed by name to Justin, were 
followed by the two pieces <I>Of the Same to Greeks</I> and <I>Of the Same to 
Diognetus</I>. The correctness of the ascription of each of these two pieces to 
Justin was separately called in question by subsequent critics; but the 
connexion between the two pieces, the contrast in style presented by both alike 
to the spurious or dubious works of Justin to which in the MS. they were 
appended, and the fact that it was not directly to Justin Martyr, but to the 
author of the address <I>To Greeks</I> that the address <I>To Diognetus</I> was 
in the MS. ascribed, were forgotten.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.3>In the MS., again, the text given under the heading <I>To 
Diognetus</I> was broken into <I>three</I> fragments by <I>two</I> clear breaks 
with marginal notes from the old 13th-cent. scribe, saying, "Thus I found a 
break in the copy before me also, it being very ancient." Of these two breaks 
the former, occurring near the end of c. vii., is ignored by Stephanus in his 
division of the writing into chapters. Whether more or less be missing, the 
writing comprised in cc. vii.-x. is plainly the continuation of the writing 
commenced in cc. i.-vii. In the concluding fragment (cc. xi. xii.), appended 
after the second break, the writer calls himself "disciple of apostles," and on 
this ground the writer <I>To Diognetus</I> has been included among the apostolic 
Fathers. But the contrast between cc. i.-x. and cc. xi. xii. is so great that 
critics have concluded the final appended fragment to be no part of the writing 
to Diognetus, but the peroration of another treatise by another writer.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.4>No other ancient copy of the Greek of any of the writings 
published in 1592 has been found; but the writer <I>To Greeks</I>, with whom the 
writer <I>To Diognetus </I>was in the MS. immediately identified, has been 
plainly distinguished from Justin by the discovery and publication by Cureton in 
his <I>Spicilegium Syriacum</I> from a 6th or 7th cent. MS. of a Syriac version 
of an almost identical discourse ascribed to one "Ambrosius, a chief man of 
Greece, who became a Christian, and all his fellow-councillors raised a clamour 
against him." We may thus say that the true traditional writer <I>To Greeks</I> 
and <I>To Diognetus</I> is a certain otherwise unknown Ambrosius, convert like 
Justin from Hellenism to Christianity--the reply <I>To Greeks</I>, the 
assailants of the writer, being naturally followed by the response <I>To 
Diognetus</I>, the inquirer.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.5>This conclusion is confirmed by internal evidence. The 
style of the two writings is identical. In each there is the same Attic diction 
joined with the same Roman dignity. Nay, in each there is the same occurrence of 
two contrasted styles, the same passage from the scornful vigour of the satirist 
to the joyous sweetness of the evangelist.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.6>"Come, be taught," says the writer <I>To Greeks</I> (c. 
v.); and it seems that Diognetus came. Common as the name was, the only 
Diognetus known to us after Christ was a painting master who <I>c.</I> 133 had 
charge of the young Marcus Aurelius. Whether this was the Diognetus who came to 
the Christian teacher we do not know. The writing addressed to him is not in 
form an epistle, it seems rather to be a discourse delivered in a Christian 
Assembly into which the eminent inquirer had found his way. His coming implied a 
triple question: (i) "On what God relying, Christians despise death and neither 
reckon those gods who are so accounted by the Greeks, nor observe any 
superstition of Jews"; (ii) "What the kindly affection is that they have one for 
another"; and (iii) "What, in short, this new race or practice might be that has 
invaded<PB id=Page_258 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y" n="258">

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>society now and no earlier." To (i) the writer replies 
in cc. i.- vii., first bidding the Greek look at his manufactured gods (c. ii.), 
and convicting the Jews of vain oblations (c. iii.) and ungrateful service (c. 
iv.) to the Giver of all to all, then (c. v.) portraying the wondrous life of 
Christians, at home yet strangers everywhere, like the soul in the body of the 
world (c. vi.), and so (c. vii.) passing from the earthly things to the heavenly 
to tell how it was God Who implanted the Word by the mission of the Maker of 
all, sent as an imperial Son, in love, to be sent again as judge. So the 
inquirer is answered that the reasons for non-compliance with Hellenism and 
Judaism are obvious, but the Christians' God is the one God of the Jews, and 
their religion consists of purity and charity, and was founded by the mission of 
the Son, Whom God will send again. At this point something has dropped out. The 
argument may be surmised to have continued after this fashion: "An end of all 
things is the doctrine of your Greek sages; but the Jews looked for a perpetual 
earthly kingdom, and when Christ proclaimed a kingdom not of this world, they 
slew Him, and yet He is not dead, and Christian worship is not to deny Him." For 
as resumed (c. vii.) after a break in the middle of a sentence, the discourse 
points to martyrdoms as "signs," not of the return but "of the presence" of the 
Lord, as though saying, "You see, He is still with us." Then proceeding (c. 
viii.) to contrast the follies of philosophy with the assurance wrought by the 
Father's revelation of Himself to faith, he explains (c. ix.) how God waited to 
shew forth what He had prepared till unrighteousness had been made manifest, and 
then, when the time came, Himself took our sins and gave His own Son for us and 
would have us trust Him. So (c. x.) he passes from expounding "on what God 
Christians rely" to expound "what the love is that they bear one to another," 
the outcome of their love to Him Who first loved them.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.7>The first two questions of the inquirer are thus 
answered, and in answering them completely the third question, "What the new 
institution might be," would be answered along with them; but that answer seems 
not to be completed before the second break. It could not be complete till it 
had been carried further than merely saying that "it was God Who implanted the 
Word," and that He did so "when the time came." "The Word that appeared new" 
must have been "found old"; and this is the answer that we find in the final 
fragment (cc. xi. xii.) after the second break. The style has become different. 
We find ourselves listening to the peroration of a homily, before the withdrawal 
of the catechumens and the celebration of the mysteries. It does not follow that 
the final fragment does not belong to the preceding discourse. If Diognetus had 
shewn his desire for instruction by coming into a Christian assembly, the whole 
discourse may have been delivered before such an audience as is addressed in the 
peroration at the close. We are brought into a new region. The satirist of 
superstition and evangelist of atoning, justifying mercy is succeeded by a 
mystical believer in a Christ born anew in hearts of saints. The new thing is 
portrayed as "that which was from the beginning," yet ever new. "This is He that 
is ever reckoned a Son today." But what it is can be known only by taking up the 
cross and so coming to be with Christ in Paradise, "Whose tree if thou bearest 
fruit and if thou choosest thou shalt eat those things that with God are 
desired."</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.8>The loss of intervening matter makes the transition to 
the new region abrupt and the contrast patent. "The Lord's Passover cometh 
forth, and, teaching saints, the Word is gladdened." But the course is still 
straightforward and the guide is not diverse. The style is different only so far 
as is necessitated by the difference of subject. It exhibits the same anarthrous 
use of nouns, the same accumulation of clause on clause, not pursued too far; 
the same unexpected turns at the close of the sentences; the same union of 
dignity with sweetness, the same blending of Pauline with Johannine teaching; 
the same persistent subordination of doctrine to life. On these grounds we may 
venture to differ from the wide consent of critics in imagining a second 
nameless author.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.9>It is worth noting that an Ambrose, of the consecration 
of Antioch, is said in a Syriac tradition to have been the third primate of 
Edessa and the East (Burkitt, <I>Early Eastern Christianity</I>, p. 29). The 
writer <I>To Greeks</I> and <I>To Diognetus</I> may have been this bringer of 
Greek Pauline Christianity to the regions beyond Euphrates conquered by Trajan 
and abandoned by Hadrian, and have been ancestor of the friend of Origen and of 
the great Milanese archbp. and of the legendary father of King Arthur.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.10>Probably an old copy exhibited three works of 
Ambrosius--an avowal of Christianity, and answers <I>To Greeks</I> and <I>To 
Diognetus</I>, each a brave act as well as a solid work, the first now lost, the 
second a fine sample of a class of controversial works of which samples are 
numerous, the third, <I>To Diognetius</I>, preserved in fragments only, but 
unique, not apologetic merely, but catechetical, a portraiture of early 
Christianity not in its manifestation only, but in its springs, bringing us to 
the gates of the Paradise of God.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.11>In free allied states like Antioch and Athens avowal of 
Christianity may have been tolerated when not suffered in Roman or subject 
regions. In the 2nd cent. the world was not yet all Roman.</P>
<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p0.12><I>The date</I> of the writings may be determined with 
great probability, not with absolute certainty, except that, if genuine, they 
cannot be post-Nicene. The picture of the church presented to Diognetus pretty 
plainly belongs to a date earlier than the accession of Commodus. The chief 
school of Christian thought would seem still to be at Athens, though on the eve 
of its transference to Alexandria by Athenagoras. It is among the writings of 
Tatian, Melito, and Theophilus and the fragments of Apollinaris, Abercius, etc., 
that these pieces seem most at home. The writer seems to appear in his freshness 
beside Justin in his ripeness, and to be the meeting-point of the teachings of 
Justin and Marcion, as he is at the point of departure of Irenaeus, Tertullian, 
Hippolytus, and Origen on the one hand, and Praxeas, Noetus, and Sabellius on 
the other.</P><PB id=Page_259 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y" n="259">

<P id=iii.iv.xvii.p1>Lost in the crowd of predecessors whom Irenaeus and Clement 
hardly ever name and merged in Justin's shadow, convinced that God alone can 
reveal Himself, and content to be hidden in his Saviour's righteousness, the old 
writer has gradually emerged by virtue of an inborn lustre, at once the 
obscurest and most brilliant of his contemporaries, and has cast a glory on the 
early church while remaining himself unknown.</P>
