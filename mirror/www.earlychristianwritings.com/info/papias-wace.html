<P>
<P><B>Papias (1)</B>, bp. of Hierapolis in Phrygia (Eus. <I>H. 
E.</I> iii. 36) in the first half of 2nd cent. Lightfoot says (<I>Coloss.</I> p. 
48), "Papias, or (as it is very frequently written in inscriptions) Pappias, is 
a common Phrygian name. It is found several times at Hierapolis, not only in 
inscriptions (Boeckh, 3930, 3912 <SMALL id=iii.xvi.xi.p1.1>A</SMALL>, add.), but 
even on coins (Mionnet, iv. p. 301). This is explained by the fact that it was 
an epithet of the Hierapolitan Zeus (Boeckh, 3912 <SMALL>A</SMALL>, <FONT face=symbol>Papia Dii swthri</FONT>)." The 
date of Papias used to be regarded as determined by a notice in the <I>Paschal 
Chronicle</I>, which was thought to record his martyrdom at Pergamus under A.D. 
163. But we have no ground for asserting that Papias lived so late as 163, and 
we shall see reason for at least placing his literary activity considerably 
earlier in the century.</P>
<P>His name is famous as the writer of a treatise in five 
books called <I>Expositions of Oracles of the Lord</I> (<FONT face=symbol>Logiwn 
Kuriakvn exhghseiV</FONT>), which title we shall discuss presently. The object 
of the book seems to have been to throw light on the Gospel history, especially 
by the help of oral traditions which Papias had collected from those who had met 
members of the apostolic circle. That Papias lived when it was still possible to 
meet such persons has given great importance to his testimony, though only some 
very few fragments of his work remain. Every word of these fragments has been 
rigidly scrutinized, and, what is less reasonable where so little is known, 
arguments have been built on the silence of Papias about sundry matters which it 
is supposed he ought to have mentioned and assumed that he did not. We give at 
length the first and most important of the fragments, a portion of the preface 
preserved by Eusebius (iii. 39), from which we can infer the object of the work 
and the resources which Papias claimed to have available. "And I will not 
scruple also to give for thee a place along with my interpretations to 
whatsoever at any time I well learned from the elders and well stored up in 
memory, guaranteeing its truth. For I did not, like the generality, take 
pleasure in those who have much to say, but in those who teach the truth; nor in 
those who relate their strange commandments, but in those who record such as 
were given from the Lord to the Faith and come from the Truth itself. And if 
ever any one came who had been a follower of the elders, I would inquire as to 
the discourses of the elders, what was said by Andrew, or what by Peter, or what 
by Philip, or what by Thomas or James, or what by John or Matthew or any other 
of the disciples of the Lord; and the things which Aristion and the elder John, 
the disciples of the Lord, say. For I did not think that I could get so much 
profit from the contents of books as from the utterances of a living and abiding 
voice."</P>
<P id=iii.xvi.xi.p1.4>The singular "for thee" in the opening words implies that 
the work of Papias was inscribed to some individual. The first sentence of the 
extract had evidently followed one in which the writer had spoken of the 
"interpretations" which appear to have been the main subject of his treatise, 
and for joining his traditions with which he conceives an apology necessary. 
Thus we see that Papias is not making a first attempt to write the life of our 
Lord or a history of the apostles, but assumes the previous existence of a 
written record. Papias enumerates the ultimate sources of his traditions in two 
classes: Andrew, Peter, and others, of whom he speaks in the past tense; 
Aristion and John the Elder, of whom he speaks in the present. As the passage is 
generally understood, Papias only claims a second-hand knowledge of what these 
had related, but had inquired from any who had conferred with elders, what 
Andrew, Peter, etc., <I>had</I> said, and what John and Aristion <I>were</I> 
saying; the last two being the only ones then surviving. But considering that 
there is a change of pronouns, we are disposed to think that there is an 
anacoluthon, and that his meaning, however ill expressed, was that he learned, 
by inquiry from others, things that Andrew, Peter, and others had said, and also 
</I>stored up in his memory things which Aristion and John said in his own hearing. Eusebius 
certainly understands Papias to claim to have been a hearer of this John and 
Aristion. The word "elders" is ordinarily used of men of a former generation, 
and would be most naturally understood here of men of the first generation of 
Christians; if it were not that in the second clause the title seems to be 
refused to Aristion, who is nevertheless described as a disciple (by which we 
must understand a personal disciple) of our Lord; and as those mentioned in the 
first group are all apostles, the word "elder," as Papias used it, may have 
included, besides antiquity, the idea of official dignity. As to whether the 
John mentioned with Aristion is different from John the apostle previously 
mentioned, see Johannes Presbyter.</P>
<P>The fragment quoted enables us to fix within certain 
limits the date of Papias. He is evidently separated by a whole generation from 
the apostolic age; he describes himself as living when it was not exceptional to 
meet persons who had. been hearers of the apostles, and (if we understand him 
rightly) he had met two who professed to have actually seen our Lord Himself. 
Eusebius tells that Philip the apostle (some suppose that he ought to have said 
Philip the deacon) came to reside at Hierapolis with his daughters; and that 
Papias, on the authority of these daughters, tells a story of Philip raising a 
man from the dead. Eusebius certainly understood Papias to describe himself as 
contemporary with those daughters and as having heard the story from them. If 
these were they whom St. Luke describes as prophesying at Caesarea in 58, and if 
they were young women then, they might have been still alive at Hierapolis 
between 100 and 110. But as Papias speaks of his inquiries in the past tense, a 
considerable time had probably elapsed before he published the results. On the 
whole, we shall not be far wrong in dating the work <I>c.</I> 130.</P>
<P>Papias evidently lived after the rise of Gnosticism and 
was not unaffected by the controversies occasioned by it. Strong asceticism was 
a feature of some of the earliest Gnostic sects; and their commandments, "Touch 
not, taste not, handle not," may well have been "the strange commandments" to 
which Papias refers. Lightfoot is probably right in thinking that the sarcasm in 
the phrase "those who have so very much to say" may have been aimed at the work 
on the Gospel by Basilides in 24 books, and some similar productions of the 
Gnostic schools of which the later book <I>Pistis Sophia</I> is a sample.</P>
<P>Of the traditions recorded by Papias, what has given rise 
to most discussion and has been the foundation of most theories is what he 
relates about the Gospels of SS. Matthew and Mark, which he is the first to 
mention by name. Concerning Mark he says, "This also the elder [John] said: Mark 
having become the interpreter of Peter wrote accurately everything that he 
remembered of the things that were either said or done by Christ; but however 
not in order. For he neither heard the Lord nor had been a follower of His; but 
afterwards, as I said, was a follower of Peter, who framed his teaching 
according to the needs [of his hearers], but not with the design of giving a 
connected account of the Lord's discourses [or oracles]. Thus Mark committed no 
error in thus writing down some things as he remembered them. For he took heed 
to one thing: not to omit any of the things he had heard, or to set down 
anything falsely therein." Concerning Matthew, all that remains of what Papias 
says is, "So then Matthew composed the oracles in Hebrew, and every one 
interpreted them as he could." For a long time no one doubted that Papias here 
spoke of our Gospels of SS. Matthew and Mark; and mainly on the authority of 
these passages was founded the general belief of the Fathers, that St. Matthew's 
Gospel had been originally written in Hebrew, and St. Mark's founded on the 
teaching of Peter. But some last-century critics contended that our present 
Gospels do not answer the descriptions given by Papias. There is a striking 
resemblance between the two as we have them at present; but Papias's 
description, it is said, would lead us to think of them as very different. St. 
Matthew's Gospel, according to Papias, was a Hebrew book, containing an account 
only of our Lord's discourses; for so Schleiermacher translates <FONT 
face=symbol>ta logia</FONT>, which we have rendered "oracles." St. Mark, on the 
other hand, wrote in Greek and recorded the acts as well as the words of Christ. 
Again, St. Mark's Gospel, which in its present state has an arrangement as 
orderly as St. Matthew's, was, according to Papias, not written in order. The 
conclusion which has been drawn is, that Papias's testimony relates not to our 
Gospels of SS. Matthew and Mark, but to their unknown originals; and accordingly 
many constantly speak of "the original Matthew," the "Ur-Marcus," though there 
is no particle of evidence beyond what may be extracted from this passage of 
Papias that there ever was any Gospel by SS. Matthew or Mark different from 
those we have. Renan even undertakes to give an account of the process by which 
the two very distinct works known to Papias, St. Matthew's collection of 
discourses, and St. Mark's collection of anecdotes, came into their present 
similar forms. In the early times, every possessor of anything that purported to 
be a record of our Lord desired to have the story complete; and would write into 
the margin of his book matter he met elsewhere, and so the book of St. Mark's 
anecdotes was enriched by a number of traits from St. Matthew's "discourses" and 
<I>vice versa</I>.</P>
<P>If this theory were true, we should expect to find in 
early times a multitude of gospels differing in their order and selection of 
facts. Why we should have now exactly four versions of the story is hard to 
explain on this hypothesis. We should expect that, by such mutual assimilation, 
all would in the end have been reduced to a single gospel. The solitary fact to 
which Renan appeals in support of his theory in reality refutes it--the fact, 
i.e., that the pericope of the adulteress (John vii. 53-viii. 11) is absent from 
some MSS. and differently placed in others. Such an instance is so unusual that 
critics have generally inferred that this pericope cannot be a genuine part of 
St. John's Gospel; but if Renan's theory were true, the phenomena present in a 
small degree in this case ought to be seen in a multitude of cases. There ought to be many 
parables and miracles of which we should be uncertain whether they were common 
to all the evangelists or special to one, and what place in that one they should 
occupy. Further, according to Renan's hypothesis, St. Mark's design was more 
comprehensive than St. Matthew's. St. Matthew only related our Lord's 
discourses; St. Mark, the "things said or done by Christ," <I>i.e.</I> both 
discourses and anecdotes. St. Mark's Gospel would thus differ from St. Matthew's 
by excess and St. Matthew's read like an abridgment of St. Mark's. Exactly the 
opposite is the case.</P>
<P>We count it a mere blunder to translate <FONT 
face=symbol>logia</FONT> "discourses" as if it were the same as <FONT 
face=symbol>logouV</FONT>. In N.T. (Acts vii. 38; Rom. iii. 2; Heb. v. 12; 1. 
Pet. iv. 11) the word has its classical meaning, "oracles," and is applied to 
the inspired utterances of God in O.T. Nor is there reason to think that when 
St. Paul, <I>e.g.</I>, says that to the Jews were committed the oracles of God, 
he confined this epithet to those parts of O.T. which contained divine sayings 
and refused it to those narrative parts from which he so often drew lessons 
(Rom. iv. 3; I.Cor. x. 1, xi. 8; Gal. iv. 21). Philo quotes as a <FONT 
face=symbol>logion</FONT> the narrative in Gen. iv. 15, "The Lord set a mark 
upon Cain," etc., and the words (Deut. x.), "The Lord God is his inheritance." 
Similarly the Apostolic Fathers. In Clement (I. Cor. 53) <FONT face=symbol>ta 
logia tou qeou</FONT> is used as equivalent to <FONT face=symbol>taV ieraV 
grafaV</FONT>. (See also c. 19, Polyc. <I>ad Phil.</I> 7.) As Papias's younger 
contemporary Justin Martyr tells us that the reading of the Gospels had in his 
time become part of Christian public worship, we may safely pronounce the silent 
substitution of one Gospel for another a thing inconceivable; and we conclude 
that, as we learn from Justin that the Gospels had been set on a level with the 
O.T. in the public reading of the church, so we know from Papias that the 
ordinary name <FONT face=symbol>ta logia</FONT> for the O.T. books had in 
Christian use been extended to the Gospels which were called <FONT 
face=symbol>ta kuriakvn logiwn exhghseiV</FONT>, the "oracles of our Lord." 
There is no reason to imagine the work of Papias limited to an exposition of our 
Lord's discourses; we translate therefore its title <FONT face=symbol>Kuriakvn 
logiwn exhghseiV</FONT>, "Expositions of the Gospels."</P>
<P id=iii.xvi.xi.p1.13>The manner in which Papias speaks of St. Mark's Gospel 
quite agrees with the inspired authority, which the title, as we understand it, 
implies. Three times in this short fragment he attests St. Mark's perfect 
accuracy. "Mark wrote down accurately everything that he remembered." "Mark 
committed no error." "He made it his rule not to omit anything he had heard or 
to set down any false statement therein." Yet, for some reason, Papias was 
dissatisfied with St. Mark's arrangement and thought it necessary to apologize 
for it. No account of the passage is satisfactory which does not explain why, if 
Papias reverenced St. Mark so much, he was dissatisfied with his order. Here the 
hypothesis breaks down at once, that Papias only possessed two documents unlike 
in kind, the one a collection of discourses, the other of anecdotes. Respecting 
St Mark's accuracy as he did Papias would certainly have accepted his order 
unless he had some other document to which, in this respect, he attached more 
value, going over the same ground as St. Mark's but in a different order. If, 
then, Papias held that St. Mark's Gospel was not written in the right order, 
what, in his opinion, was the right order? Strauss considers and rejects three 
answers to this question, as being all irreconcilable at least with the 
supposition that the Gospel known to Papias as St. Mark's was that which we 
receive under the name: (1) that the right order was St. John's; (2) that it was 
St. Matthew's; (3) that Papias meant to deny to St. Mark the merit, not only of 
the right order, but of any orderly arrangement at all. Lightfoot defended (1) 
with great ability (<I>Contemp. Rev.</I> Oct. 1875, p. 848). But there remains 
another answer which we believe the true one--viz. that Papias regarded St. 
Luke's as the right order. The reason this solution has been generally set aside 
is that St. Luke's Gospel is not mentioned in any extant fragments of Papias, 
from which it has been assumed that he was unacquainted with Luke's writings. If 
we had the whole work of Papias the argument from his silence might be 
reasonable; but we have no right to assume his silence merely because Eusebius 
included no statement about St. Luke in the few brief extracts from Papias which 
he gives. Lightfoot has shewn (<I>Coloss.</I> p. 52) that Eusebius is not wont 
without some special reason to copy references made by his predecessors to 
undisputed books of the Canon. Hilgenfeld finds in the preface of Papias echoes 
of the preface to St. Luke's Gospel which induce him to believe that Papias knew 
that gospel. To us this argument does not carry conviction, but there is every 
appearance that Papias was acquainted with the Acts. In one fragment he mentions 
Justus Barsabas; in another he gives an account of the death of Judas Iscariot 
which seems plainly intended to reconcile the story in St. Matthew with that in 
the Acts. One extant fragment appears to have been part of a comment on our 
Lord's words preserved by St. Luke, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from 
heaven."</P>
<P>But if Papias knew St. Luke's Gospel, his language with 
respect to St. Mark's is at once explained. St. Luke's preface declares his 
intention to write in order, <FONT face=symbol>grayai kaqexhV</FONT>; but his 
order is neither St. Mark's nor St. Matthew's. On this difference we conceive 
Papias undertook to throw light by his traditional anecdotes. His account is 
that Mark was but the interpreter of Peter, whose teaching he accurately 
reported; that Peter had not undertaken at any time to give an orderly account 
of our Lord's words and deeds, but had merely related some of them from time to 
time as the immediate needs suggested; that Mark therefore faithfully reported 
what he had heard, and if his order was not always accurate it was because it 
had been no part of his plan to aim at accuracy in this respect. With regard to 
St. Matthew's Gospel, his solution seems to be that the church had not then the 
Gospel as St. Matthew had written it; that the Greek Matthew was but an 
unauthorized translation from a Hebrew original which individuals had 
translated, each for himself as he could. Thus, so far from it being true that Papias did not use our present Gospels, we 
believe that he was the first to harmonize them, and to proclaim the principle 
that no apparent disagreement between them affects their substantial truth. 
Remembering the solicitude Papias here displays to clear the Gospels from all 
suspicion of error, and the recognition of inspired authority implied in the 
title <FONT face=symbol>logia</FONT>, we cannot admit the inference which has 
been drawn from the last sentence of the fragment, that Papias attached little 
value to the Gospels as compared with the <I>viva voce</I> traditions he could 
himself attest; and we endorse Lightfoot's explanation, that it was the Gnostic 
apocryphal writings which Papias found useless in his attempts to illustrate the 
Gospel narrative accepted by the church.</P>
<P>As we have seen, the extant fragments of Papias do not 
mention the Gospels of SS. Luke or John by name. Eusebius says, however, that 
Papias uses testimonies from St. John's first epistle. There is therefore very 
strong presumption that Papias was acquainted with the Gospel, a presumption 
strengthened by the fact that the list of the apostles in the fragment of the 
preface contains names in the order in which they occur in St. John's Gospel, 
placing Andrew before Peter, and includes some such as Thomas and Philip, who 
outside that Gospel have little prominence in the Gospel record, and that it 
gives to our Lord the Johannine title, the Truth. Irenaeus (v. 36) has preserved 
a fragment containing an express recognition of St. John's Gospel; and though 
Irenaeus only gives it as a saying of the elders, Lightfoot (<I>Contemp. Rev., 
u.s.</I>) has given convincing reasons for thinking that Papias is his 
authority, a conclusion which Harnack accepts as highly probable. An argument 
prefixed to a Vatican (9th cent.) MS. of St. John's Gospel quotes a saying of 
Papias about that Gospel and speaks of Papias as having been John's amanuensis. 
On the latter statement, see Lightfoot, <I>u.s.</I> p. 854; but the evidence 
seems good enough to induce us to believe that the work of Papias contained some 
notices of St. John's Gospel which Eusebius has not thought it worth while to 
mention. Papias belonged to Asia Minor, where the Fourth Gospel according to all 
tradition was written, and where its authority was earliest recognized; and he 
is described by Irenaeus as a companion of Polycarp, of whose use of St. John's 
Gospel we cannot doubt. Eusebius does not mention that Papias used the 
Apocalypse; but we learn that he did from other trustworthy authorities, and on 
the subject of Chiliasm Papias held views most distasteful to Eusebius. We learn 
from Irenaeus (v. 33) that Papias, in his fourth book, told, on the authority of 
"the Elder" [John], how our Lord had said that "the days will come when there 
shall be vines having 10,000 stems, and on each stem 10,000 branches, and on 
each branch 10,000 shoots, and on each shoot 10,000 clusters, and in each 
cluster 10,000 grapes, and each grape when pressed shall give 25 measures of 
wine. And when any of the saints shall take hold of a cluster, another shall cry 
out, I am a better cluster, take me, and bless the Lord through me." The story 
tells of similar predictions concerning other productions of the earth, and 
relates how the traitor Judas expressed his unbelief and was rebuked by our 
Lord. The ultimate original of this story of Papias was a Jewish apocryphal book 
made known by Ceriani, <I>Monumenta Sac. et Profan.</I>, in 1866. See the 
Apocalypse of Baruch, c. 29, in Fritzsche, <I>Libri Apoc. Vet. Test.</I> p. 666. 
To this, and possibly other similar stories, Eusebius no doubt refers when he 
says that Papias had related certain strange parables and teachings of the 
Saviour and other things of a fabulous character. Amongst these Eusebius quotes 
the doctrine that after the resurrection the kingdom of Christ would be 
exhibited for a thousand years in a sensible form on. this earth; and he 
considers that things spoken mystically by the apostles had wrongly been 
understood literally by Papias, who "was a man of very poor understanding as his 
writings shew." The common text of Eusebius elsewhere (iii. 26) calls him a very 
learned man, deeply versed in the Holy Scriptures; but the weight of evidence is 
against the genuineness of the clause containing this encomium, which probably 
expresses later church opinion.</P>
<P>Eusebius tells nothing as to Papias's use of St. Paul's 
Epistles, and, though the silence of Eusebius alone would not go far, Papias may 
have found no occasion to mention them in a work on the gospel history. In 
looking for traditions of our Lord's life, Papias would naturally inquire after 
the testimony of those who had seen Him in the flesh. The very gratuitous 
inference from the assumed fact that Papias does not quote St. Paul, that he 
must have been Ebionite and anti-Pauline, is negatived by the fact that, as 
Eusebius testifies, he used St. Peter's Epistle, a work the teaching of which, 
as all critics allow, is completely Pauline. If the silence of Eusebius as to 
the use by Papias of St. John's Gospel and St. Paul's Epistles affords any 
presumption, it is that Papias gave no indication that his opinion about the 
undisputed books differed from that which, in the time of Eusebius, was received 
as unquestioned truth. For Eusebius thought meanly of Papias and, if he had 
known him to have held wrong opinions about the Canon, would have been likely to 
have mentioned it in disparagement of his authority in support of Chiliasm.</P>
<P id=iii.xvi.xi.p1.17>Eusebius says that Papias tells a story of a woman 
accused before our Lord of many sins, a story also to be found in the Gospel 
according to the Hebrews. There is a reasonable probability that this story may 
be that of the woman taken in adultery, now found in the common text of St. 
John's Gospel. Eusebius does not say that Papias took this story from the Gospel 
according to the Hebrews, and the presumption is that Papias gave it as known to 
him by oral tradition and not from a written source. If so, Papias need have had 
no direct knowledge of the Gospel according to the Hebrews. Papias has a story 
about Justus Barsabas having taken a cup of poison without injury. If Papias's 
copy of St. Mark contained the disputed verses at the end, this story might 
appropriately have been told to illustrate the verse, "If they drink any deadly 
thing it shall not hurt them," a promise instances of the fulfilment of which 
are very rare, whether in history or legend. A story of the kind is told of the apostle John, but is probably later than Papias, 
or we should have been likely to have heard of it here.</P>
<P>Georgius Hamartolus quotes Papias as saying, in his 
second book, that the apostle John had been killed by the Jews. That there is 
some blunder is clear; but Lightfoot has made it very probable from comparison 
with a passage in Origen that a real saying of Papias is quoted, but with the 
omission of a line or two. Papias, in commenting on Matt. xx. 22, may very well 
have said, as does Origen, that John had been condemned by the Roman emperor to 
exile at Patmos and that James had been killed by the Jews.</P>
<P>In Joannes Presbyter we quote several authorities (including 
Irenaeus) who speak of Papias as a disciple of John the Evangelist. He is called 
by Anastasius of Sinai <FONT face=symbol>o panu</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>o 
poluV</FONT>, and passed in the church as an authority of the highest rank. 
Jerome (<I>Ep. ad Lucinium</I>, 71 Vallars.) contradicts a report that he had 
translated the writings of Papias and Polycarp, declaring that he had neither 
leisure nor ability for such a task. He does not, in his writings, shew any 
signs that he knew more of the work of Papias than he could have learned from 
Eusebius. The latest trace of the existence of the work of Papias is that an 
inventory, A.D. 1218, of the possessions of the cathedral of Nismes (Menard. 
<I>Hist. civil. ecclés. et littér. de la ville de Nismes</I>) contains the entry 
"Item inveni in claustro--librum Papie librum de verbis Domini." No trace of 
this MS. has been recovered. The fragments of Papias have been assembled in 
various collections, <I>e.g.</I> Grabe (<I>Spicilegium</I>), Galland and Routh 
(<I>Rel. Sac.</I>), but can best be read in Gebhardt and Harnack's <I>Apost. 
Fathers</I>, pt. ii.; a trans. is in the vol. of <I>Apost. Fathers</I> in <I>Ante-Nicene 
Lib.</I> (T. &amp; T. Clark). Dissertations on Papias are very numerous; we 
may mention important articles in the <I>Theol. Studien und Kritiken</I> by 
Schleiermacher, 1832, Zahn, 1867, Steitz, 1868; an essay by Weiffenbach 
(Giessen, 1876), a reply by Leimbach (Gotha, 1878), and a rejoinder by 
Weiffenbach, <I>Jahrbuch f. Prot. Theol.</I> 1877; Hilgenfeld in his 
<I>Journal</I>, 1875, 1877, 1879; Lightfoot, <I>Contemp. Rev.</I> 1867, 1875 ; 
Harnack, <I>Chronologie</I>.</P>
<P>Others of the name of Papias are--a martyr with Victorinus 
(Assemani, <I>Act. Mart. Or. et Occ.</I> ii. 60); a martyr with Onesimus at 
Rome, Feb. 16; a physician at Laodicea (Fabric. <I>Bibl. Gr.</I> vii. 154); and 
a grammarian Papias in the 11th cent., a note of whose on the Maries of the 
Gospel was published by Grabe among the fragments of Papias of Hierapolis and 
accepted as such until Lightfoot established the true authorship.</P>
