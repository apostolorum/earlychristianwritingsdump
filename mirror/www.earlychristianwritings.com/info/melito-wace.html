<P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p1><B>Melito</B>, bp. of Sardis, held in the middle of the 
2nd cent. a foremost place among the bishops of Asia as regards personal 
influence and literary activity. Shortly before the end of that cent. his name 
is mentioned by Polycrates of Ephesus in his letter to Victor of Rome (Eus. 
<I>H. E.</I> v. 24.) as one of the luminaries of the Asiatic church by whose 
authority<PB id=Page_720 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y" n="720">

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>its Quartodeciman practice had been commended. The next 
extant mention of him some 20 years later is in the <I>Little Labyrinth</I> 
(Eus. v. 28). He is there appealed to as one of the writers, older than Victor 
of Rome, who had spoken of our Lord as being God as well as man. A reference to 
him in a lost work of Tertullian, known to us through a citation by Jerome in 
the art. <I>s.v.</I> in his Catalogue (c. 24), shews his high reputation in 
Tertullian's time. Our fullest information is from the notices in Eusebius 
(<I>H. E.</I> iv. 13, 26), who gives a list of Melito's works with which he was 
acquainted, together with 3 extracts.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p1.1>His <I>Apology</I> presented to the emperor Marcus 
Aurelius may have been his latest work. It is placed under A.D. 170 in Jerome's 
translation of the Chronicle of Eusebius, but the date may be more safely 
inferred from a passage preserved by Eusebius. Melito, addressing Marcus 
Aurelius, and speaking of Augustus, says, "Of whom you have become the 
much-wished-for successor, and shall be so with your son if you keep that 
philosophy which took its beginning with Augustus," etc. That he here says "with 
your son," not "with your brother," is evidence that the date is later than the 
death of Lucius Verus, in 169. Commodus was associated in the empire with his 
father in 176. The passage quoted does not shew whether this association had 
already taken place or was only anticipated. In 177 persecutions of Christians 
were raging violently all over the empire. Melito's memorial seems to have been 
written at the very first beginning of that persecution. The Christians seem to 
be suffering more in their property than in their persons, and Melito is able to 
express a doubt whether the emperor had sanctioned the cruelties, and a belief 
that, when he had examined the case, he would interfere in their favour. Melito 
declares that Nero and Domitian were the only emperors who had sanctioned 
persecutions of Christians, and probably from this passage Tertullian derived 
his argument that only bad emperors had persecuted the Christians. On the other 
side, as forbidding interference, Melito quotes the letter of Hadrian to 
Fundanus, and letters of Antoninus, at a time when Aurelius himself was 
associated in the government, to the people of Larissa, of Thessalonica, and of 
Athens. One extract from the Apology preserved in the <I>Paschal Chronicle</I> 
(p. 483, Dindorf) gave rise to some discussion in the early Socinian 
controversy. "We are not worshippers of senseless stones, but adore one only 
God, Who is before all and over all, and [over] His Christ truly God the Word 
before all ages." The second "over" given in Rader's ed. of the Chronicle does 
not appear in the latest ed. (Dindorf's).</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p1.2>An Apology is extant in a Syriac trans. in one of the 
Nitrian MSS. in the Brit. Mus., which bears the heading, "The oration of Melito 
the Philosopher held before Antoninus Caesar, and he spoke to Caesar that he 
might know God, and he shewed him the way of truth, and began to speak as 
follows." Probably the Syriac translator, finding in his Greek original that the 
Apology was "addressed" to the emperor, made a blunder in supposing it delivered 
<I>viva voce</I>. It was printed in Syriac, with English trans. by Cureton 
(<I>Spicileg. Syr.</I>) and by Pitra, with a Latin trans. by Renan (<I>Spicil. 
Solesm.</I> vol. ii.) which has been revised in Otto's <I>Apologists</I>, vol. 
ix. Although this Syriac Apology appears complete, it contains none of the 
passages cited by Eusebius, and its character seems entirely different from that 
of the work known to Eusebius. The latter was mainly intended to induce the 
emperor to stop the persecution by shewing that the Christians did not deserve 
the treatment inflicted. The Syriac Apology is a calm argument against the 
absurdities of polytheism and idolatry, such as might have been written with the 
hope of making a convert of the emperor, but does not exhibit any of the mental 
tension of one suffering under unjust persecution. The Syriac Apology is, 
therefore, probably not the same as that from which Eusebius made extracts. Did, 
then, Melito write two apologies? The <I>Paschal Chronicle</I> records an 
Apology of Melito under both A.D. 164 and 169, but this is clearly only a double 
mention of one Apology, probably caused by the double mention in Eus. iv. 13, 
26. The ascription of the Syriac Apology to Melito is probably an error, though 
the document is perhaps not much later. There are slight, but we think decisive, 
traces of the use of Justin Martyr's Apology: it must therefore be later than 
that. It is addressed to an emperor Antoninus, who might have been Pius, 
Aurelius, Caracalla, or Elagabalus. Probably one of the latter two is intended. 
The writer's point of view seems to be Syrian. In enumerating heathen idolatries 
he omits (as we should not expect from Melito writing in Asia Minor) Cybele and 
the Ephesian Diana; while he speaks in much detail of Syrian objects of worship, 
and seems to be personally acquainted with the city of Mabug, the Syrian 
Hierapolis. The, admonition, "if they wish to dress you in a female garment, 
remember that you are a man," suggests Elagabalus rather than any of the other 
emperors mentioned. One other passage supports a presumption of Syrian 
authorship. The writer speaks of the world as destined to suffer from three 
deluges--one of wind, one of water, one of fire; the first two already past, the 
third still to come. The deluge of wind is that by which the tower of Babel was 
supposed to have been destroyed (see the Sibylline verses quoted by Theophilus, 
<I>ad Autol.</I> ii. 31, and also Abydenus, quoted by Eus. <I>Praep. Evan.</I> 
ix. 14). "Flood of wind" occurs in the work called <I>The Cave of Treasures</I> 
(Cureton, <I>Spicil. Syr.</I> p. 94), and in the Ethiopic book of Adam (Ewald's 
<I>Jahrbücher der Bibl. Wiss.</I> 1853). It has been contended that the 
reference to the deluge of fire shews acquaintance with II. Peter; but it seems 
to us that this can by no means be positively asserted. On N.T. allusions in 
this Apology ee Westcott (<I>N. T. Canon</I>, p. 219). Against placing it so 
late as Elagabalus it may be urged that its conclusion, if interpreted 
naturally, speaks of the emperor as having children; and though the apologist 
might be merely expressing a wish on behalf of the emperor's unborn successors, 
it is simpler to refer the work to the time of Caracalla, who<PB id=Page_721

Tertullian, who was acquainted with the Eusebian Apology of Melito, also used 
this one. Such perhaps may be the identification of Serapis with Joseph and the 
remark that the old heathen gods were practically less honoured than the 
emperors, since their temples had to pay taxes.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p1.3>Of other works of Melito the <FONT face=symbol>peri 
tou pasca</FONT> is first in the list of Eusebius. The date is limited by the 
opening sentence which Eusebius quotes: "In the proconsulate over Asia of 
Servilius Paulus, at the time that Sagaris suffered martyrdom, there took place 
much dispute at Laodicea about the Paschal celebration <FONT 
face=symbol>empesontoV kata kairon</FONT> in those days, and these things were 
written." Rufinus here reads "Sergius Paulus," and this appears from other 
authorities to have been the real name of the proconsul in question, probably 
within the limits 164-166.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p1.4>The appeal of Polycrates to the authority of Melito 
makes it clear that the latter, in his work on Easter celebration, took the 
Quartodeciman side. Eusebius says that the work of Melito drew forth another, no 
doubt on the opposite side, from Clement of Alexandria. It has been conjectured 
that Melito was the Ionian whom Clement (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> v. 11) enumerates as 
among his teachers. It should be noticed that the extant fragments of Melito 
refute the notion that Quartodecimanism was inconsistent with the reception of 
the Fourth Gospel. Melito speaks of our Lord's three years' ministry after His 
baptism, which he could not have learned from the Synoptists. He accounts for 
the fact that a ram, not a lamb, was substituted as a sacrifice for Isaac, by 
the remark that our Lord, when He suffered, was not young like Isaac, but of 
mature years. Possibly here may be an indication that Melito held the same 
theory concerning our Lord's age as Irenaeus and other Asiatics, derived no 
doubt from John viii. 57. The whole passage shews that Melito believed strongly 
in the atoning efficacy of Christ's death, and looked on Him as the sacrificial 
lamb. The word he uses is <FONT face=symbol>amnoV</FONT>, as in the Gospel, not 
<FONT face=symbol>arnion</FONT> as in the Apocalypse.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p2>The next work of Melito from which Eusebius has given an 
extract is called <I>Selections</I>, addressed to a friend named Onesimus, who 
had asked Melito to make selections from the law and the prophets of passages 
concerning our Saviour, and concerning all our faith, and also to give him 
accurate information as to the number and order of the O.T. books. Melito 
relates that he had gone up to the East to the place where the things were 
preached and done, and had accurately learned the books of the O.T. He 
enumerates the five books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four of Kings, two of 
Chronicles, Psalms of David, Proverbs of Solomon, also called Wisdom, 
Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job; of the Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, the twelve 
Minor Prophets in one book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras. The last, no doubt, 
includes Nehemiah and possibly Esther, which is otherwise omitted. This list 
gives the Hebrew canon adopted by the Church of England; but gives a different 
order of the books from that of Josephus, and does not attempt to make the 
number of books 22. The expressions "the Old Books," "the Books of the O.T.," 
shew clearly that the church of Melito's time had a <I>New</I> Testament 
canon.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p2.1>Eusebius enumerates other works of Melito as being 
known to him. The titles enable us imperfectly to guess at their contents, and 
sometimes the titles themselves are uncertain. (4) <FONT face=symbol>ta peri 
politeiaV kai profhtvn</FONT>, very likely two separate works "on Christian 
Conversation" and "on the Prophets" coupled together by Eusebius, because 
contained in the same volume in the Caesarean Library. (5) <FONT 
face=symbol>peri ekklhsiaV</FONT>. It has been conjectured that the breaking out 
of Montanism may have made it necessary to insist on the authority of the 
church. (6) <FONT face=symbol>peri kuriakhV</FONT>. Possibly the Quartodeciman 
controversy led to discussion about the Lord's Day. This word <FONT 
face=symbol>kuriakh</FONT>, used in Rev. i. 10, is found also in Ignatius's Ep. 
to the Magnesians, c. 9, and in the letter of Dionysius of Corinth to Soter 
(Eus. iv. 33). (7) <FONT face=symbol>peri fusewV anqrwpou</FONT>. (8) <FONT 
face=symbol>peri plasewV</FONT>. This book on the formation of man, and (7) on 
the nature of man, if that be the reading, are conjectured to have been directed 
against Gnostic theories. (9) <FONT face=symbol>peri upakohV pistewV 
aisqhthriwn</FONT>. What was the subject of a treatise on the obedience of faith 
of the senses has perplexed ancient as well as modern readers of this list. 
Jerome thinks that a <FONT face=symbol>peri</FONT> may have dropped out of the 
text, and that there were two treatises, one on the Obedience of Faith, one on 
the Senses. (10) <FONT face=symbol>peri yuchV kai swmatoV kai nooV</FONT>, 
probably on Human Nature. (11) <FONT face=symbol>peri loutrou</FONT>. (12) <FONT 
face=symbol>peri alhqeiaV</FONT>, perhaps an apologetic work in commendation of 
Christianity. (13) <FONT face=symbol>peri ktisewV kai genesewV Cristou</FONT>. 
Ancient writers with one consent apply to our Lord the <FONT face=symbol>KurioV 
ektise me archn odvn autou</FONT> of Prov. viii. 22. For a full discussion of 
this verse see Athan. <I>Or. Cont. Ar.</I> ii. 44. (14) <FONT face=symbol>peri 
proqhteiaV</FONT>. A work with the same title written, or intended to be 
written, by Clement of Alexandria, was directed against the Montanists 
(<I>Strom.</I> iv. 13, p. 605), and this may also have been the design of this 
work of Melito, if the Montanist controversy had broken out before his death. 
(15) <FONT face=symbol>peri filoxeniaV</FONT>. (16) <FONT face=symbol>h 
kleiV</FONT>. What was the nature of this work we have no information. A Latin 
work entitled <I>Melitonis Clavis Sanctae Scripturae</I> mentioned by Labbe in 
1653 as preserved in the library of the Clermont College is a medieval Latin 
composition. (17) (18) <FONT face=symbol>ta peri tou diabolou kai thV 
apokaluyewV</FONT> '<FONT face=symbol>Iwannou</FONT>. The form of expression 
would indicate that both subjects were discussed in a single treatise. (19) 
<FONT face=symbol>peri enswmatou qeou</FONT>. It would be natural to translate 
this, On God Incarnate, and we have other evidence that Melito wrote on the 
Incarnation. When he speaks of the two natures which our Lord combined, there is 
no trace of anthropomorphism in the attributes which he ascribes to the Divine 
nature. On the other hand Origen, commenting on Gen. i. 26 (vol. viii. 49, 
Lomm.) and arguing against the Anthropomorphites, says "of whom is Melito, who 
has left a certain treatise, <FONT face=symbol>peri tou enswmaton einai ton 
qeon</FONT>." Probably Origen made a mistake, and that the<PB id=Page_722

it is not impossible that a writer as orthodox as Melito may have held the 
opinions which Origen imputes to him.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p2.2>The list given shews Melito's great activity as a 
writer, and the wide range of his writings.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p2.3>Of spurious writings ascribed to Melito, we need only 
mention a commentary on the Apocalypse, the ascription to Melito apparently 
having been made by the fraud or ignorance of some transcriber, and not intended 
in the work itself, which is a compilation from various writers, some as late as 
the 13th cent. Through two works, <I>de Passione S. Joannis</I> and <I>de 
Transitu b. Mariae</I>, with which Melito's name was connected, it became widely 
known in the West, though with various disguises of form, such as Mileto, 
Miletus, and Mellitus, the last being the most common.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxvii.p2.4>The remains of Melito are given by Routh (<I>Rel. 
Sac.</I> i. 113-153), and more fully by Otto (<I>Corp. Apol. Chr.</I> ix. 
375-478). See also Piper (<I>Stud. und Krit.</I> 1838, p. 54), Westcott (<I>N.
