<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.1><B>Valentinus (1)</B> (<FONT 
face=symbol>OualentinoV</FONT>), founder of one of the Gnostic sects which 
originated in the first half of 2nd cent.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.2>1. <I>Biography.</I>--According to the tradition of the 
Valentinian school witnessed to by Clemens Alexandrinus (<I>Strom.</I> vii. 17, 
106, p. 898, Potter), Valentinus had been a disciple of Theodas, who himself, it 
is very improbably said, knew St. Paul. Valentinus cannot have begun to 
disseminate his Gnostic doctrines till towards the end of the reign of Hadrian 
(117-138). Before this he is said to have been a Catholic Christian. It must 
have been, therefore, at most only shortly before his appearance as the head of 
a Gnostic sect that Valentinus became a hearer of Theodas and received, as he 
said, his doctrines from him. The Gnostics were fond of claiming for their 
secret doctrines apostolic tradition and tracing them back to disciples of the 
apostles. To this otherwise unknown Theodas the Valentinians appealed as an 
authority in much the same way as Basilides was said to have been a disciple of 
Glaucias, and he, in turn, an "interpreter of Peter."</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.3>Irenaeus (i. 11, 1) speaks of Valentinus as the first who 
transformed the doctrines of the Gnostic "Heresy" to a peculiar doctrinal system 
of his own (<FONT face=symbol>eis idion carakthra didaskaleiou</FONT>). By the 
expression <FONT face=symbol>gnwstikh</FONT> we understand a party which called 
themselves "Gnostics," whom we may recognize in the so-called Ophites, described 
by Irenaeus (i. 30), when he remarks that the Valentinian school originated from 
those unnamed heretics as from the many-headed Lernean Hydra (i. 30, 15). 
Concerning the home and locality of these so-called "Gnostics" Irenaeus tells us 
nothing. But we know from other sources that those Ophite parties to whom he 
refers had their homes both in Egypt and Syria.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.4>Concerning the fatherland of Valentinus himself Epiphanius 
is the first to give accurate information, which, however, he derived simply, it 
appears, from oral tradition (Epiph. <I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 2). According to this 
his native home was on the coast of Egypt, and he received instruction in Greek 
literature and science at Alexandria. Epiphanius, who makes him begin to teach 
in Egypt, relates<PB id=Page_999 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y" 
n="999"> 
<TABLE align=left bgColor=#660000 class=marg>
  <TBODY>

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>further that he also went to Rome, and appealed as a 
religious teacher there, but that, both in Egypt and at Rome, he was regarded as 
orthodox, and first made shipwreck of faith in Cyprus and began to disseminate 
heretical opinions. But this statement rests merely on a combination of 
different accounts. According to Irenaeus, Valentinus "flourished" at Rome in 
the times of Pius and Anicetus. Epiphanius, on the other hand, read (as we learn 
from Philaster, <I>Haer.</I> 38) in the <FONT face=symbol>suntagma</FONT> of 
Hippolytus, that Valentinus stood once in the communion of the church, but being 
drawn by overweening pride into apostasy had, during his residence in Cyprus, 
propounded his heretical doctrine. But we cannot doubt that when Irenaeus speaks 
of Valentinus's flourishing at Rome during the times of Pius and Anicetus, he 
refers to the fact that his chief activity as a religious teacher was then 
displayed, and that under Anicetus he stood at the head of his own Gnostic 
school. With this there is no difficulty in reconciling Tertullian's statement, 
that Valentinus no more than Marcion separated himself from the Church on his 
arrival at Rome (<I>Praescript. Haeret.</I> 36). For the Gnostics, for the very 
sake of disseminating their doctrines the more freely, made a great point of 
remaining in the Catholic church, and made use for that end of a twofold mode of 
teaching, one exoteric for the simpler sort of believers, the other esoteric for 
the initiated, as is shewn in the fragments which have come down to us, the most 
part of which purposely keep the peculiarly Gnostic doctrines in the 
background.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.5>We may, then, conclude that Valentinus, towards the end of 
Hadrian's reign (<I>c.</I> 130), appeared as a teacher in Egypt and in Cyprus, 
and early in the reign of Antoninus Pius he came to Rome, and during the long 
reign of Antoninus was a teacher there. He had probably developed and secretly 
prepared his theological system before he came to Rome, whither he doubtless 
removed for the same motive as led other leaders of sects, <I>e.g.</I> Cerdon 
and Marcion, to go to Rome--the hope to find a wider field for his activity as a 
teacher. From a similar motive he attached himself at first to the communion of 
the Catholic church.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.6><I>II. History of the Sect.</I>--Valentinus had numerous 
adherents. They divided themselves, we are told, into two schools--the anatolic 
or oriental, and the Italian school (Pseud-Orig. <I>Philosoph.</I> vi. 35, p. 
195, Miller, cf. Tertullian, <I>adv. Valentinian.</I> c. 11, and the title 
prefixed to the excerpts of Clemens <FONT face=symbol>Ek tou Qeudotou tai thV 
AnatolikhV kaloumenhV didaskaliaV</FONT>). The former of these schools was 
spread through Egypt and Syria, the latter in Rome, Italy, and S. Gaul. Among 
his disciples, Secundus appears to have been one of the earliest. Tertullian 
<I>(adv. Valentinian.</I> 4) and the epitomators of Hippolytus mention him after 
Ptolemaeus (Pseudo-Tertull. <I>Haer.</I> 13; Philast. <I>Haer.</I> 40); the 
older work, on the other hand, excerpted by Irenaeus is apparently correct in 
naming him first as Valentines s earliest disciple (<I>Haer.</I> i. 11, 2). Then 
follows, in the same original work as quoted by Irenaeus (<I>Haer.</I> i. 11, 
3), another illustrious teacher (<FONT face=symbol>alloV epifanhV 
didaskaloV</FONT>), of whom a misunderstanding of later heresiologists has made 
a Valentinian leader, named Epiphanes; who this illustrious teacher was is 
matter of dispute. The more probable conjecture is with Neander (<I>Gnostische 
Systeme</I>, p. 169) and Salmon to suppose it was <A 
href="http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/" id=iii.xxii.v.p0.7>M<SMALL 
id=iii.xxii.v.p0.8>ARCUS</SMALL> (17)</A>, whose first Tetrad exactly 
corresponds to that of this unnamed teacher (cf. <I>Haer.</I> i. 15, 1, <FONT 
face=symbol>kaQ a proeirhtai</FONT>). Marcus himself will, in any case, be among 
the earliest of Valentinus's disciples (Lipsius, <I>Quellen der ältesten 
Ketzergesch.</I> p. 33). His labours in Asia were probably contemporaneous with 
Valentinus's residence and activity at Rome, and there a "godly elder and herald 
of the truth," whom Irenaeus quotes from as an older authority, made him the 
subject of metrical objurgation as the "forerunner of anti-Christian malice" 
(Iren. <I>Haer.</I> i. 15, 6).</P>
<P>Ptolemaeus, on the 
other hand, was a contemporary of Irenaeus himself, and one of the leaders of 
the Italian school (Iren. <I>Haer. Praef.</I> 2, Pseud-Orig. <I>Philos.</I> vi. 
35), whom Hippolytus in the <I>Syntagina</I>, and probably on the basis of an 
arbitrary combination of Iren. i. 8, 5 with 11, 2, puts at the head of all other 
disciples of Valentinus. Heracleon was still 
younger than Ptolemaeus, and the second head of the Italian school. His 
doctrinal system appears to be that mainly kept in view in the 
<I>Philosophumena</I> (cf. vi. 29, 35). Irenaeus names him as it were in passing 
(<I>Haer.</I> ii. 4, 1), while Tertullian designates his relation to his 
predecessors with the words, Valentinus shewed the way, Ptolemaeus walked along 
it, Heracleon struck out some side paths (<I>adv. Valentinian.</I> 4). He makes 
also the like remark concerning Secundus and Marcus. Clemens speaks of Heracleon 
(<I>c.</I> 193) as the most distinguished among the disciples of Valentinus 
(<I>Strom.</I> iv. 9, 73, p. 595), meaning, of course, among those of his own 
time. Origen's statement, therefore, that he had a personal acquaintance with 
Valentinus (Origen, <I>in Joann.</I> t. ii. 8) is to be received with caution. 
In part contemporaneously with him appear to have worked the heads of the 
anatolic (oriental) school Axionikos and Bardesanes ('<FONT 
face=symbol>ArdhsianhV</FONT>, <I>Philos.</I> vi. 35), who both lived into the 
first decennia of cent. iii.</P>
<P>Axionikos was still working at Antioch when Tertullian 
composed his book against the Valentinians, therefore <I>c.</I> 218 (Tertull. 
<I>l.c.</I>). We cannot here discuss how far the celebrated Edessene Gnostic Bardesanes (<I>ob.</I> 223) is rightly accounted 
a Valentinian. Tertullian indicates Axionikos as the only one who in his day 
still represented the original teaching of Valentines. Theotimus, therefore, who 
is previously mentioned by Tertullian, and seems to have occupied himself much 
with the "Figures of the Law," was, it appears, an older teacher. The same was 
also probably the case with Alexander, the Valentinian whose syllogisms 
Tertullian had in his hands (<I>de Carne Christi</I> cc. 16 sqq.).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.17>Concerning the later history of the Valentinian sect we 
have but meagre information. Tertullian, writing <I>c.</I> 218, speaks of the 
Valentinians in his book against them as the "frequentissimum collegium inter 
haereticos." This is confirmed by what is told us of the local extension of the sect. From Egypt it seems to 
have spread to Syria, Asia Minor, and to Rome. Its division into an oriental and 
an Italian school shews that it had adherents even after the death of its 
founder, in both the East (Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia) and West (specially at 
Rome). In Asia Minor the doctrine appears to have been mainly disseminated by 
Marcus, who was so vigorously attacked (<I>c.</I> 150) by the "godly elder," 
quoted by Irenaeus (<I>Haer</I>. i. 15, 6). Disciples of Marcus were found by 
Irenaeus in the Rhone districts (<I>Haer</I>. i. 13, 7), where also he appears 
to have met with adherents of Ptolemaeus (<I>Haer. Praef. </I>2). In Rome, 
<I>c.</I> 223, an important work of the Italian school came into the hands of 
the writer of the <I>Philosophumena, </I>who speaks of both schools as being in 
existence in his time (<I>Philos</I>. vi. 35, p. 195). Tertullian also mentions 
the <I>duae scholae</I> and <I>duae cathedrae</I> of the party in his time 
(<I>adv. Valent.</I> 11). Remains of the sect were still found in Egypt in the 
time of Epiphanius (<I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 7). Theodoret, on the other hand (<I>H. 
f. Praef.</I>), can only speak of the Valentinians as of other Gnostic sects 
(whom he deals with in his first book) as belonging to the past--<FONT 
face=symbol>palaiaV aireseiV</FONT>--of whom he possesses a mere historical 
knowledge.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.18>III. <I>Writings.</I>--The fragments of the writings of 
Valentinus have been collected by Grabe (<I>Spicilegium</I>, ii. 45-48), and 
more completely by Hilgenfeld (<I>Ketzergeschichte</I>, pp. 93-207). They 
consist of fragments of letters and homilies preserved by Clemens Alexandrinus 
(<I>Strom.</I> ii. 8, 36, p. 448; ii. 20, 114, pp. 488 seq.; iii. 7, 59, p. 538; 
iv. 13, 91, p. 603; vi. 6, 52, p. 767), and of two pieces contained in the 
<I>Philosophumena</I>, the narrative of a vision (<FONT 
face=symbol>orama</FONT>) seen by Valentinus (<I>Philos.</I> vi. 42, p. 203), 
and the fragment of a psalm composed by him (<I>Philos.</I> vi. 37, pp. 197 
seq.). Psalms of Valentinus's authorship are mentioned by Tertullian (<I>de 
Carne Christi</I>, 17, 20).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.19>Remains of the writings of the school of Valentinus are 
more abundant. Beside the numerous fragments and quotations in Irenaeus and the 
<I>Philosophumena</I>, and in the excerpts from Theodotus, and the anatolic 
school, which seem yet to need a closer investigation, we may mention: the 
letter of Ptolemaeus to Flora (<I>ap.</I> Epiphan. <I>Haer.</I> xxxiii. 3-7), 
numerous fragments from the commentaries (<FONT face=symbol>upomnhmata</FONT>) 
of Heracleon on St. Luke (<I>ap.</I> Clem. Alex. <I>Strom.</I> iv. 9, 73 seq., 
pp. 595 seq.; excerpt. ex prophet. § 25, p. 995), and on St. John (ap. Origen 
<I>in Joann.</I> passim), collected by Grabe (<I>Spicil.</I> i. 80-117) and 
Hilgenfeld (<I>Ketzergeschichte</I>, 472-498); lastly, a rather large piece out 
of an otherwise unknown Valentinian writing preserved by Epiphanius 
(<I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 5 and 6).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.20>IV. <I>Accounts given by the Fathers.</I>--Statements 
concerning Valentinus and his school are very numerous, but many are so 
contradictory that it is difficult to distinguish the original doctrine of 
Valentinus from later developments. Even in his day Tertullian made the 
complaint (<I>adv. Valentinian.</I> 4), "Ita nunquam jam Valentinus, et tamen 
Valentiniani, qui per Valentinum." Among those who before him had controverted 
the Valentinians, Tertullian enumerates (<I>ib.</I> 5): Justin Martyr, 
Miltiades, Irenaeus, and the Montanist Proculus. Of the writings of these four 
on this subject one only has been preserved, the great work of Irenaeus in five 
books, entitled <FONT face=symbol>ElegcoV kai anatroph thV yeudwnumou 
gnwsewV</FONT>, which has come down to us in great part only in the ancient 
Latin version. This work was written (see iii. 3, 3) in the time of the Roman 
bp. Eleutherus, <I>c.</I> 180-185. The greater part of bk. i., which Epiphanius 
has preserved to us almost completely, deals exclusively with the Valentinians, 
and the refutations in the following books are principally concerned with 
them.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.21>The sources which Irenaeus used are of sufficient 
variety. In the preface to bk. i. (c. 2 ) he refers to the writings of those who 
call themselves disciples of Valentinus, adding that he had met some of them 
himself and heard their opinions from their own mouths. Immediately afterwards 
he indicates that the contemporary Valentinians, whose doctrine he promises to 
describe, are those of the school of Ptolemaeus. In bk. i. (c. 8, 5) he 
introduces into a detailed description of the Valentinian method of interpreting 
Scripture a large fragment which undertakes to prove the truth of the higher 
Ogdoad of the Valentinian Pleroma from the prologue of the Gospel of St. John. 
The concluding notice (found only in the Latin text) expressly ascribes the 
authorship of this fragment to Ptolemaeus. Irenaeus likewise obtained his 
information as to the doctrine and practices of the Marcosians partly from a 
written source, partly from oral communications. We can hardly assume that 
Marcus was still alive when Irenaeus wrote, but it is not unlikely that 
adherents of Marcus may have appeared then in the Rhone districts. The section 
which specially treats of Marcus (i. 12-15) is apparently from a written source; 
but what he brings to light for the first time (cc. 16-18) concerning the 
mysteries celebrated by the Marcosians is from oral information.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.22>Next in importance to the statements of Irenaeus, as a 
source of information concerning Valentinus and his school, are the fragments 
preserved among the works of Clemens Alexandrinus, and entitled '<FONT 
face=symbol>Ek tvn Qeodotou kai thV anatolikhV kaloumenhV didaskaliaV 
epitomai</FONT>. The text has come down to us in a somewhat forlorn condition. 
The best ed. is Bunsen's, in <I>Analecta Antinicaena</I>, vol. i. (Lond. 1854), 
pp. 205-278. The general character of these excerpts is similar to others in 
other writings of Clemens Alexandrinus, and does not justify the assumption that 
their present abrupt fragmentary form proceeded from Clemens himself.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.23>Very little is obtainable from the <I>Syntagma</I> of 
Hippolytus, preserved in the excerpts of Pseudo-Tertullian (<I>Haer.</I> 12) and 
by Philaster (<I>Haer.</I> 38), as also partly by Epiphanius (<I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 
8; cf. <I>Quellen d. alt. Ketzergesch.</I> p. 166). Hippolytus combined Irenaeus 
(cc. 1-7) with some authority belonging to the older anatolic system.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.24><I>Pseud-Origines,</I> now almost universally assumed to 
be Hippolytus, gives us in the <I>Philosophumena</I> 
(the larger '<FONT face=symbol>ElegcoV kata pasvn airesewn</FONT>) a quite 
peculiar account of the Valentinian system, one mere uniform and synoptical than that of Irenaeus. The original 
authority on which this description is based cannot have been the same as that 
in the <I>Syntagma</I> which belonged to the anatolic school, the former being a 
product of the Western or Italian. The doctrinal system reproduced by 
Pseud-Origines is in general akin to the Ptolemaic presented by Irenaeus. But 
his original authority is entirely independent of the sources used by 
Irenaeus.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.27>Tertullian's tractate <I>adversus Valentinianos</I> is 
not an independent authority. Apart from a few personal notices concerning him 
and his disciples which he may have taken from the lost work of Proculus (c. 4, 
cf. c. 11), his whole account is a paraphrase of Irenaeus, whom he follows 
almost word for word, and more or less faithfully from c. 7 onwards.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.28>Epiphanius (<I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 9-32) has incorporated the 
whole long section of Irenaeus (i. 1-10) in his <I>Panarion. Haer.</I> xxxii. 
</I>and xxxiv. (Secundus, Marcus) are simply taken from Irenaeus. He follows 
Irenaeus also in his somewhat arbitrary way in what he says about Ptolemaeus, 
Colarbasus, Heracleon (<I>Haer.</I> xxxiii. xxxv. xxxvi.). On the other hand, 
<I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 7, 8, is taken from the <I>Syntagma</I> of Hippolytus: 
<I>Haer.</I> xxxiii. 3-7 contains the important letter of Ptolemaeus to Flora. <I>Haer.</I> xxxi. 5 and 6 
gives a fragment of an unknown Valentinian writing, from which the statements in 
c. 2 are partly derived. This writing, with its barbarous names for the Aeons 
and its mixture of Valentinian and Basilidian doctrines, shows anatolic 
Valentinianism as already degenerate.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.31>Later heresiologists, <I>e.g.</I> Theodoret, who 
(<I>Haer. Fab.</I> i. 7-9) follows Irenaeus and Epiphanius, are not independent 
authorities.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p0.32>V. <I>The System.</I>--A review of the accounts given by 
the Fathers confirms the judgment that, with the means at our command, it is 
very difficult to distinguish between the original doctrine of Valentinus and 
the later developments made by his disciples. A description of his system must 
start from the <I>Fragments</I>, the authenticity of which (apart from the 
so-called <FONT face=symbol>oroV Oualentinou</FONT> in Dial. <I>de Recta 
Fide</I>) is unquestioned. But from the nature of these fragments we cannot 
expect to reconstruct the whole system out of them. From an abundant literature 
a few relics only have been preserved. Moreover, the kinds of literature to 
which these fragments belong--letters, homilies, hymns--shew us only the outer 
side of the system, while its secret Gnostic doctrine is passed over and 
concealed, or only indicated in the obscurest manner. The modes of expression in 
these fragments are brought as near as possible to those in ordinary church use. 
We see therein the evident desire and effort of Valentinus to remain in the 
fellowship of the Catholic church. Of specific Gnostic doctrines two only appear 
in their genuine undisguised shape, that of the celestial origin of the 
spiritual man (the Pneumaticos), and that of the Demiurge; for the docetic 
Christology was not then, as is clear from Clemens Alexandrinus, exclusively 
peculiar to the Gnostics. All the more emphatically is the anthropological and 
ethical side of the system insisted on in these fragments.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p1>As the world is an image of the living Aeon (<FONT 
face=symbol>tou zvntoV aivnoV</FONT>), so is man an image of the pre-existent 
man of the <FONT face=symbol>anqrwpoV prown</FONT>. Valentinus, according to 
Clemens Alexandrinus (<I>Valentini Homil.</I> ap. <I>Clem. Strom.</I> iv. 13, 
92), spoke of the Sophia as an artist (<FONT face=symbol>zwgrafoV</FONT>) making 
this visible lower world a picture of the glorious Archetype, but the hearer or 
reader would as readily understand the heavenly Wisdom of the Book of Proverbs 
to be meant by this Sophia as the 12th and fallen Aeon. Under her (according to 
Valentinus) stand the world-creative angels, whose head is the Demiurge. Her 
formation (<FONT face=symbol>plasma</FONT>) is Adam created in the name of the 
'<FONT face=symbol>AnqrwpoV prowm</FONT>. In him thus made a higher power puts 
the seed of the heavenly pneumatic essence (<FONT face=symbol>sperma thV anwqen 
ousiaV</FONT>). Thus furnished with higher insight, Adam excites the fears of 
the angels; for even as <FONT face=symbol>anqropoi</FONT> are seized with fear 
of the images made by their own hands to bear the name of God, <I>i.e.</I> the 
idols, so these angels cause the images they have made to disappear (<I>Ep. ad 
Amicos</I> ap. <I>Clem. Alex. Strom.</I> ii. 8, 36). The pneumatic seed (<FONT 
face=symbol>pneuma diaferon</FONT> or <FONT face=symbol>genoV diaferon</FONT>) 
nevertheless remains in the world, as a race by nature capable of being saved 
(<FONT face=symbol>fusei swzomenon genoV</FONT>), and which has come down from a 
higher sphere in order to put an end to the reign of death. Death originates 
from the Demiurge, to whom the word (Ex. xxxiii. 20) refers that no one can see 
the face of God without dying. The members of the pneumatic church are from the 
first immortal, and children of eternal life. They have only assumed mortality 
in order to overcome death in themselves and by themselves. They shall dissolve 
the world without themselves suffering dissolution, and be lords over the 
creation and over all transitory things (<I>Valent. Hom.</I> ap. <I>Clem. 
Strom.</I> iv. 13, 91 seq.). But without the help of the only good Father the 
heart even of the spiritual man (the pneumaticos) cannot be cleansed from the 
many evil spirits which make their abode in him, and each accomplishes his own 
desire. But when the only good Father visits the soul, it is hallowed and 
enlightened, and is called blessed because one day it shall see God. This 
cleansing and illumination is a consequence of the revelation of the Son 
(<I>ib.</I> ii. 20, 114).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p1.1>We learn from the fragments only (<I>Valent. Ep. ad 
Agathopoda</I> ap. <I>Clem. Strom.</I> iv. 7, 59) that Jesus, by steadfastness 
and abstinence, earned for Himself Deity, and by virtue of His abstinence did 
not even suffer to be corrupted the food which He received (<I>i.e.</I> it did 
not undergo the natural process of digestion), because He Himself was not 
subject to corruption. It must remain undetermined how Valentinus defined the 
relation of Jesus to the <FONT face=symbol>uioV</FONT>. If the text of the 
passage quoted above be sound, Jesus put Himself in possession of Godhead by His 
own abstinence, a notion we should expect in Ebionite rather than in Gnostic 
circles. But the true reading may be <FONT face=symbol>eikazeto</FONT> (not 
<FONT face=symbol>eirgazeto</FONT>), and in that case the meaning will be that 
by an extraordinary asceticism Jesus avoided every kind of material pollution, 
and so became Himself the image of the incorruptible and
imperishable Godhead. At any rate, this fragment does 
not tell us whether, according to the teaching of Valentinus, the body of Jesus 
was pneumatic or psychical. According to another fragment attributed to 
Valentinus, and preserved by Eulogius of Alexandria (ap. Photium, <I>Bibl. 
Cod.</I> 230), he appears to have treated with ridicule the opinion of the 
"Galileans" that Christ had two natures, and to have maintained that He had but 
one nature composed of the visible and the invisible. Hilgenfeld (<I>l.c.</I> 
pp. 302 seq.) supposes the Valentinus of this fragment to be the Gnostic, while 
others take him to have been the Apollinarian. But we have no other instance of 
any Gnostic giving to Catholic Christians (as did the emperor Julian later) the 
epithet "Galilean." Further, although Tertullian (<I>adv. Prax.</I> 29) and 
Origen (<I>de Princip.</I> i. 2, 1) may have spoken of two natures or two 
substances in Christ, we can hardly imagine Valentinus pronouncing a doctrine 
ridiculous, and yet it finding acceptance in his school. For we find the 
Occidental Valentinians actually teaching in very similar terms, that Soter, the 
common product of the whole Pleroma, united himself with the Christus of the 
Demiurge the Man Jesus. Could we otherwise assume that the fragment is genuine, 
it would serve to prove that the doctrine of the Oriental school concerning the 
pneumatic body of Christ was in fact the original teaching of Valentinus. How 
Valentinus thought concerning the origin of matter and of evil cannot be made 
out from existing fragments. When, however, we find him designating the Demiurge 
as author of death, we can hardly suppose that he derived the transitory nature 
and other imperfections of the terrestrial universe from an originally evil 
material substance. The view, moreover, which underlies the psalm of Valentinus, 
of which the <I>Philosophumena</I> have preserved a fragment (<I>Philos.</I> vi. 
37, pp. 197 seq.) is decidedly monastic. He there sees in the spirit how "all 
things are hanging (<FONT face=symbol>kremamena</FONT>) and are upborne (<FONT 
face=symbol>ocoumena</FONT>), the flesh hanging on the soul, the soul upborne by 
the air, the air hanging on the aether, from Bythos fruits produced and from the 
womb the child." An interpretation of these sayings current in the Valentinian 
school is appended. According to this interpretation, flesh is the <FONT 
face=symbol>ulh</FONT> which depends upon the soul (the psychical nature) of the 
Demiurge. Again the Demiurge hangs from the spirit which is outside the Pleroma, 
<I>i.e.</I> the Sophia in the kingdom of the Midst, the Sophia from Horus and 
from the Pleroma, and finally the world of Aeons in the Pleroma from the abyss, 
<I>i.e.</I> their Father. If this interpretation be, as we may assume, correct, 
Valentinus must have conceived the whole universe as forming a grand scale of 
being, beginning with the abysmal ground of all spiritual life, and thence 
descending lower and lower down to matter. The whole scale then is a descent 
from the perfect to ever more and more imperfect images; according to the 
principle expressly laid down by Valentinus, that the cosmos is as inferior to 
the living Aeon as the image is inferior to the living countenance (ap. <I>Clem. 
Strom.</I> iv. 13, 92). This view of the nature of the universe exhibits a much 
nearer relationship to Platonic philosophy than to the Oriental dualism which 
underlay the older Gnostic systems; and Hippolytus is therefore completely 
right, when dealing with the psalm of Valentinus, to speak of <I>Platonising</I> 
Gnostics (<I>Philos.</I> vi. 37, p. 197).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p1.2>The fragments do not give us any detailed acquaintance 
with the doctrine of Valentinus concerning the Aeons. The <FONT 
face=symbol>Pathr</FONT> or <FONT face=symbol>BuqoV</FONT> stands at their head; 
but what place in the Valentinian Pleroma was assigned to the '<FONT 
face=symbol>AnqropoV prowm</FONT> in whose name Adam was created, is difficult 
to determine.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p1.3>Of a two-fold Sophia, a higher and a lower, we read 
nothing. Sophia is the artist (<FONT face=symbol>zwgrafoV</FONT>) who forms the 
world after the archetype of the living Aeon, in order to be honoured by his 
name. The world as formed obtains credit and stability through the invisible 
nature of God (<I>Strom.</I> iv. 13, 92).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p1.4>To what authority Valentinus made appeal as the source of 
his doctrine cannot be made out from the fragments. <I>From the Homily to the 
Friends</I> Clemens Alexandrinus has preserved a sentence which defines "many of 
the things written in the public books" (<FONT face=symbol>dhmosioiV 
biblioV</FONT>: he means doubtless the writings of the O.T.) as "found written 
in the church of God"--"for," he adds, "those things which are common" 
(<I>i.e.</I> not <I>merely</I> found in books--read, with Heinrici <FONT 
face=symbol>koina</FONT> instead of <FONT face=symbol>kena</FONT>) "are words 
from the heart"; and proceeds, "The law written in the heart is the People of 
the Beloved One, both loved and loving" (Grabe was wrong in proposing to emend 
<FONT face=symbol>laoV</FONT> into <FONT face=symbol>logoV</FONT>). The meaning 
is that this "People" is in virtue of the inward revelation of the Logos a law 
unto itself (cf. Rom. ii. 14). But this inward revelation has reference 
only to "that which is common" (<FONT face=symbol>ta koina</FONT>), <I>i.e.</I> 
to the universal ethical truths written in the heart which "the church of God" 
needs not first to learn from "the public books." But this passage tells us 
nothing about the sources whence Valentinus derived his Gnosis. For these we 
must go back to the statement of Clemens (<I>Strom.</I> vii. 17, 106), according 
to which the Valentinians spoke of their leader as having learned of a certain 
Theodas, a disciple of St. Paul. But the actual statement of Irenaeus is more to 
be depended on, that Valentinus was the first who transformed the old doctrines 
of "the Gnostics" into a system of his own (<I>Haer.</I> i. 11, 1; cf. Tert. 
<I>adv. Valentinian.</I> 4.). The fragments, moreover, give a series of points 
of contact with the opinions of these older "Gnostics." We may therefore regard 
as an axiom to be adhered to in our investigations that of any two Valentinian 
doctrines, that is the older and more original which approaches more closely to 
the older and vulgar Gnosis (Iren. i. 30). Yet the system of Valentinus had a 
peculiar character of its own. He was the first to breathe a really philosophic 
spirit into the old vulgar Gnosis, by making use of Plato's world of thought to 
infuse a deeper meaning into the old Gnostic myths. Baur, therefore, was quite 
right in emphasizing the Platonism of Valentinus (<I>Christliche Gnosis</I>, pp 
124 seq.), to which the <I>Philosophumena</I> had already called attention 
(<I>Philos.</I> vi. 21 sqq.).</P>
<P>Irenaeus completes the information afforded by the fragments concerning Valentinus's doctrine of 
the Aeons. At the head of them stands a <FONT face=symbol>duaV 
anonomastoV</FONT>, the '<FONT face=symbol>ArrhtoV</FONT> (called also <FONT 
face=symbol>BuqoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>Pater agennhtoV</FONT>) and his 
<FONT face=symbol>suzugoV</FONT> the <FONT face=symbol>Sigh</FONT>. From this 
Dyad proceeds a second Dyad, <FONT face=symbol>Pathr</FONT> and '<FONT 
face=symbol>Alhqeia</FONT>, which with the first Dyad forms the highest Tetrad. 
From this Tetrad a second Tetrad proceeds--<FONT face=symbol>LogoV</FONT> and 
<FONT face=symbol>Zwh</FONT>, '<FONT face=symbol>AnqrwpoV</FONT> and '<FONT 
face=symbol>Ekklhsia</FONT>, and these complete the First Ogdoad. From <FONT 
face=symbol>LogoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>Zwh</FONT> proceed a Decad, from 
<FONT face=symbol>AnqrwpoV</FONT> and '<FONT face=symbol>Ekklhsia</FONT> a 
Dodecad of Aeons. In this the number 30 of Aeons forming the Pleroma is 
completed. The names of the Aeons composing the Decad and the Dodecad are not 
given. We may, however, venture to assume that the names elsewhere given by 
Irenaeus (i. 1, 2), and literally repeated by Pseud-Origenes (<I>Philos.</I> vi. 
30), and then again by Epiphanius (xxxi. 6) with some differences of detail, in 
his much later account, did really originate from Valentinus himself. They are 
as follows: From <FONT face=symbol>LogoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>Zwh</FONT> 
proceed <FONT face=symbol>BuqioV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>MixiV</FONT>, 
'<FONT face=symbol>AghratoV</FONT> and '<FONT face=symbol>EnwsiV, 
AutofnhV</FONT> and '<FONT face=symbol>Hdonh,</FONT> '<FONT 
face=symbol>AkinhtoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>Sugkrasis, MonogenhV</FONT> 
and <FONT face=symbol>Makaria</FONT>. From '<FONT face=symbol>AnqrwpoV</FONT> 
and '<FONT face=symbol>Ekklhsia</FONT> proceed: <FONT 
face=symbol>ParaklhtoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>PistiV, PatrikoV</FONT> and 
'<FONT face=symbol>ElpiV, MhtrikoV</FONT> and '<FONT face=symbol>Agape</FONT>, 
'<FONT face=symbol>AeinouV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>SunesiV</FONT>, '<FONT 
face=symbol>EkklhsiastikoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>MakariothV, 
QelhtoV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>Sofia</FONT>. However arbitrary this 
name-giving may seem, it is evident that the first four masculine Aeons repeat 
the notion of the First Principle, and the first four feminine the notion of his 
syzygy, in various forms of expression. The names <FONT 
face=symbol>MonogenhV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>NouV</FONT> (here '<FONT 
face=symbol>AeinouV</FONT>) meet us again among the Valentinians of Irenaeus as 
expressions for the secend Masculine Principle, and <FONT 
face=symbol>ParaklhtoV</FONT> as that for the common product of all the 
Aeons--the Soter. <FONT face=symbol>PatrikoV, MhtrikoV,</FONT> '<FONT 
face=symbol>EkklhsiastikoV</FONT> are names simply expressing that the Aeons 
which bear them are derived from the higher powers within the Pleroma. The 
feminine names <FONT face=symbol>Makaria, PistiV,</FONT> '<FONT 
face=symbol>ElpiV</FONT>, '<FONT face=symbol>Agaph, SunesiV, Sofia</FONT>, 
describe generally the perfection of the Pleroma by means of Predicates borrowed 
from the characteristics of the perfect Pneumaticos. So that all these inferior 
Aeon names are but a further and more detailed expression of the thought 
contained in the names of the first and second Tetrad. The first Tetrad 
expresses the essence of the Upper Pleroma in itself, the second Tetrad divided 
into two pairs of Aeons expresses its revelation to the Pneumatici and the 
Pneumatic World.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.1>The last of the 30 Aeons, the Sophia or <FONT 
face=symbol>Mhthr</FONT>, falls out of the Pleroma. In her remembrance of the 
better world she gives birth to Christus with a shadow (<FONT face=symbol>meta 
skiaV tinoV</FONT>), Christus being of masculine nature, cuts away the shadow 
from himself and hastens back into the Pleroma. The mother, on the other hand, 
being left behind and alone with the shadow, and emptied of the pneumatic 
substance, gives birth to another Son the Demiurge, called also <FONT 
face=symbol>Pantokratwr</FONT>, and at the same time with him a sinistrous 
archon (the <FONT face=symbol>Kosmokratwr</FONT>). So then from these two 
elements, "the right and the left," the psychical and the hylical, proceeds this 
lower world. This the original doctrine of Valentinus appears to have had in 
common with that of the Ophites (Iren. i. 30), that both doctrines knew of only 
one Sophia, and that for the Ophites also Christus leaves the Sophia behind and 
escapes himself into the upper realm of light.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.2>The notion of a fall of the last of the Aeons from the 
Pleroma, and the consequent formation of this lower world as the fruit of that 
fall, is new and peculiar to Valentinus in his reconstruction of the older 
Gnosticism. He set his Platonic Monism in the place of the Oriental Dualism. The 
Platonic thought of the soul's fall and longing after the lost world of light he 
combined with the other Platonic thought of the things of this lower world being 
types and images of heavenly Archetypes, and so obtained a new solution of the 
old problems of the world's creation and the origin of evil.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.3>The statements of Irenaeus concerning his teaching are, 
alas! too fragmentary and too uncertain to supply a complete view of the system 
of Valentinus. But the excerpts in Clemens Alex. taken from Theodotos and the 
anatolic school contain a doctrine in §§ 1-42, which at any rate stands much 
nearer to the views of Valentinus than the detailed account of Ptolemaic 
doctrines which Irenaeus gives in i. 1-8. We have in these excerpts a somewhat 
complete whole, differing in some important respects from the doctrinal system 
of the Italic school, and agreeing with that of Valentinus in that it knows of 
only one Sophia, whose offspring Christus, leaving his mother, enters the 
Pleroma, and sends down Jesus for the redemption of the forsaken One.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.4>The doctrine of the Aeons stands as much behind the 
anthropological and ethical problems in these excerpts as it does in the 
fragments. We find something about the Pleroma in an interpretation of the 
prologue of St. John's Gospel (<I>Excerpt.</I> §§ 6, 7). By the <FONT 
face=symbol>arch</FONT> of St. <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:1," 
id=iii.xxii.v.p2.5>John i. 1</A>, in which the Logos "was," we must understand 
the <FONT face=symbol>MonogenhV</FONT> "Who is also called God" (the reading 
<FONT face=symbol>o monogenhV qeoV</FONT> <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:18," 
id=iii.xxii.v.p2.6>John i. 18</A> being followed). "The Logos was <FONT 
face=symbol>en arch</FONT>" means that He was in the Monogenes, in the <FONT 
face=symbol>NouV</FONT> and the '<FONT face=symbol>Alhqeia</FONT>--the reference 
being to the syzygy of <FONT face=symbol>LogoV</FONT> and <FONT 
face=symbol>Zwh</FONT> which is said to have proceeded from <FONT 
face=symbol>NouV</FONT> and '<FONT face=symbol>alhqeia</FONT>. The Logos is 
called God because He is in God, in the <FONT face=symbol>NouV</FONT>. But when 
it is said <FONT face=symbol>o gegonen en autv zwh hn</FONT>, the reference is 
to the <FONT face=symbol>Zwh</FONT> as <FONT face=symbol>suzugoV</FONT> of the 
Logos. The Unknown Father (<FONT face=symbol>pathr agnwstoV</FONT>) willed to be 
known to the Aeons. On knowing Himself through His own '<FONT 
face=symbol>EnqumhsiV</FONT>, which was indeed the spirit of knowledge (<FONT 
face=symbol>pneuma gnwsewV</FONT>), He, by knowledge, made to emanate the 
Monogenes. The Monogenes having emanated from the Gnosis, <I>i.e.</I> the 
Enthymesis of the Father, is in Himself Gnosis, <I>i.e.</I> Son, for it is 
through the Son that the Father is <I>known</I>. The <FONT face=symbol>pneuma 
agaphV</FONT> mingles itself with the <FONT face=symbol>pneuma gnwsewV</FONT> as 
the Father with the Son (<I>i.e.</I> the Monogenes or <FONT 
face=symbol>NouV</FONT>) and the Enthymesis with '<FONT 
face=symbol>Alhqeia</FONT>, proceeding from the Aletheia as the Gnosis proceeds 
from the Enthymesis. The <FONT face=symbol>monogenhV nioV</FONT>, Who abides in 
the bosom of the Father, emanates from the Father's bosom and thereby declares 
(<FONT face=symbol>exhgeitai</FONT>) the Enthymesis through Gnosis to the Aeons. Having become visible on earth, He is no 
longer called by the apostle Monogenes (simply), but <FONT face=symbol>wV 
monogenhV</FONT>. For though remaining in Himself one and the same, He is in the 
creation called <FONT face=symbol>prwtokotoV</FONT>, and in the Pleroma <FONT 
face=symbol>MonogenhV</FONT>, and appears in each locality as He can be 
comprehended there.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.7>The preceding survey shews that in the first 42 paragraphs 
or sections of Clemens's fragments from Theodotus we really have a 
well-connected and consistent doctrinal system. The scattered notices in §§ 1-28 
fit tolerably well into the dogmatic whole, and doubtless we have here an 
account of the so-called anatolic school, and in substance the oldest form of 
the Valentinian system.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.8>The historical development of the Valentinian doctrine can 
be traced with only approximate certainty and imperfectly. The roots of the 
system are to be found in the old vulgar Gnosis. For even if the original 
dualistic foundation is repressed and concealed by a Platonizing pantheism, it 
still gives evident tokens of its continued existence in the background. The 
<FONT face=symbol>ulh</FONT> and "dark waters" into which the Ophitic Sophia 
sinks down (Iren. i. 30, 3) are here changed into the <FONT 
face=symbol>kenwma</FONT> or <FONT face=symbol>usterhma</FONT>, which in 
antithesis to the <FONT face=symbol>plhrwma</FONT> is simply an equivalent for 
the Platonic <FONT face=symbol>mh on</FONT>.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.9>The notion of a psychical Christus who passes through Mary 
as water through a conduit (Iren. vii. 2) is to be found everywhere in the 
Italic school (<I>Philos.</I> vi. 35, pp. 194 seq.).</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.10>The centre of gravity of the whole system lies 
undoubtedly in its speculative interests. The names alone of the 30 Aeons are a 
proof of this. It deserves notice that the designations <FONT 
face=symbol>NouV</FONT> and <FONT face=symbol>MonogenhV</FONT> applied to the 
first masculine principle emanating from the supreme Father do not seem to have 
been used by Valentinus himself. It was called simply <FONT 
face=symbol>Pathr</FONT> or '<FONT face=symbol>AnqrwpoV</FONT> (<FONT 
face=symbol>nioV anqrwpou</FONT>). It is a genuinely speculative feature that 
the knowledge of the Father through the Son is derived from a union of the 
Spirit of Love with the Spirit of Knowledge.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.11>Since the doctrine of Valentinus concerning the Aeons 
originated in the cosmogonic and astral powers of the old Syrian Gnosis, one 
cannot doubt that the Aeons were originally thought of as mythological 
personages and not as personified notions, although Tertullian (<I>adv. 
Valentin.</I> 4) would refer the former view to Ptolemaeus, and not Valentinus, 
as its first author.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.12>A yet more widely different conception of the Valentinian 
doctrine of Aeons is found in the fragment given by Epiphanius (xxxi. 5-6). 
Here, too, the speculative interest is manifest in the endeavour to follow up in 
detail the process of the emanation of individual Aeons within the Pleroma from 
the <FONT face=symbol>Autopatwr</FONT>. But the whole description, bathed as it 
is in sensuous warmth, with its peculiar plays with numbers and its barbarous 
names for individual Aeons, appears to be merely a degenerate Marcosian form of 
Gnosis.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.13>Finally, we have a quite peculiar transformation of the 
Valentinian system in the doctrine of the so-called Docetae, as preserved in the 
<I>Philosophumena</I> (viii. 8-11). From the <FONT face=symbol>prvtoV 
qeoV</FONT>, who is small as the seed of a fig-tree but infinite in power, 
proceed first of all three Aeons, which by the perfect number ten enlarge 
themselves to thirty Aeons; from these proceed innumerable other bisexual Aeons, 
and from these an infinite multiplicity of Ideas, of which those of the third 
Aeon are expressed and shapen in the lower world of darkness as <FONT 
face=symbol>fwteinai carakthreV</FONT>.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.14>The Platonic foundation of the Valentinian system is very 
perceptible in this its last offshoot, though mixed up in a peculiar way with 
Oriental Dualism. At the same time these Docetae endeavour to reduce the 
metaphysical distinctions which they maintain to merely gradual ones. No part of 
Christendom therefore is entirely excluded from the knowledge of the Redeemer, 
and participation in His Redemption: all, even those of the lower grades of the 
spirit-world, participate at least <FONT face=symbol>ek merouV</FONT> in the 
Truth. The way in which all, and each according to his measure, attain knowledge 
of the truth, is, as in the doctrine of the church, <I>Faith</I>. Since the 
Redeemer's advent--so we read expressly--"Faith is announced for the forgiveness 
of sins."</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p2.15>Beside working out philosophical problems, the disciples 
of Valentinus were much occupied with seeking traces of their Master's doctrine 
in Holy Scripture. The excerpts of Clemens and abundant notices in Irenaeus tell 
of an allegorical method of scriptural exposition pursued with great zeal in the 
Valentinian schools, not limited to the Gospels or the Pauline Epistles, but 
extending to the O.T., and attaching special significance to the history of 
creation in Genesis. Valentinian expositors shew a special preference for St. 
John's Gospel, and above all for its prologue. Some allegorical expositions have 
been preserved belonging to the anatolic school (<I>Exc. ex Theod.</I> §§ 6, 7) 
and others derived from Ptolemaeus (Iren. i. 8, 5). But before all we must make 
mention of the labours of Heracleon, of which Origen has preserved numerous 
specimens. From Heracleon proceeded the first known commentary on St. John's 
Gospel.</P>
<P id=iii.xxii.v.p3>VI. <I>Literature.</I>--Valentinus occupies a distinguished 
place in all works on Gnosticism, <I>e.g.</I> in Neander, Baur, Matter, Lipsius, 
Möhler (<I>Geschichte der Kosmologie in der Christlichen Kirche</I>), Mansel 
(<I>The Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries</I>--a posthumous 
work, ed. by Bp. Lightfoot), and in the Prolegomena of Harvey's ed. of Irenaeus. 
The best monograph is by Heinrici (<I>Die Valentinianische Gnosis und die 
Heilige Schrift</I>, Berlin, 1851), with which cf. the review by Lipsius 
(<I>Protestantische Kirchenzeitung</I>, 1873, pp. 174-186). [H<SMALL
