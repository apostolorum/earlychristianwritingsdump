INTRODUCTORY NOTICE TO 
THE TEACHING OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES 
<P>The interest so generally excited in the learned world by the ("Bryennios") 
discovery of a very primitive document, rendered it indispensable that this 
republication should be enriched by it, in connection with the <I>Apostolic 
Constitutions</I> (so called), which had been reserved for the concluding volume 
of the series. The critics were greatly divided as to the genuineness of the 
<I>Bryennios</I> Ms.; and, in order to gain time, I had relegated the 
<I>Constitutions</I>, with this document as its sequel or its preface, to a 
place with the <I>Apocrypha.</I> Dissatisfied with my own impressions and 
conjectures, I soon decided that the task of editing the <I>Teaching</I>, as the 
Bryennios document is entitled, must be entrusted to an "expert," and that, if 
possible, it should be taken in hand with the <I>Constitutions.</I> In order to 
give sufficient time, I entrusted the task, a year ago, to the well-qualified 
head and hands of Professor Riddle of Hartford, who most kindly accepted my 
proposals, and who now enables me to present his completed work to the public 
with the volume to which it properly belongs. It will be hailed by literary men 
generally as a timely reviewal of the whole subject, nor should I be surprised 
to find Dr. Riddle's estimate of the <I>Teaching</I> accepted as the most 
important contribution yet made to the literature of inquiry touching its worth 
and character. Appearing, as it does in this place, in close relations with the 
<I>Constitutions</I>, and with the editorial comparisons so felicitously 
introduced by the learned annotator, the student will find himself in a position 
to weigh and to decide for himself all the questions that have been raised in 
previous examinations of the case. Without risking any judgment of my own upon 
the decisions which have been reached by Dr. Riddle in the exercise of his great 
critical skill, I cannot withhold an expression of gratitude for the 
impartiality and scientific conscientiousness with which he has handled the 
matter. Uninfluenced by prepossessions, he presents the case with judicial 
calmness and with due consideration of what others have suggested. I am 
gratified to find that impressions of my own are strengthened by his 
conclusions. In an early notice of the Bryennios discovery, contributed to a 
leading publication, I stated my surmise that the <I>Teaching</I>, and its 
parallels in the <I>Constitutions</I> and other primitive writings, would prove 
to be based upon some original document, common to all. Even Lactantius, in his 
<I>Institutes</I>, shapes his instructions to Constantine by the <I>Duae 
Viae</I>, which seem to have been formulated in the earliest ages for the 
training of catechumens. The elementary nature and the "childishness" of the 
work are thus accounted for, and I am sure that the "mystagogic" teaching of 
Cyril receives light from this view of the matter. This work was "food for 
lambs:" it was not meant to meet the wants of those "of full age." It may prove, 
as Dr. Riddle hints, that the <I>Teaching</I> as we have it, in the Bryennios 
document, is tainted by the views of some nascent sect or heresy, or by the 
incompetency of some obscure local church as yet unvisited by learned teachers 
and evangelists. It seems to me not improbably influenced by views of the 
<I>charismata</I>, which ripened into Montanism, and which are illustrated by 
the warnings and admonitions of Hermas. </P>
<P align=center><FONT size=+2>Introductory Notice by Professor M. B. Riddle, 
D.D.</FONT></P>

<P align=center><A name=P4911_1840035></A><FONT size=3>Section 1.-The Discovery 
of the Codex, and Its Contents. </FONT></P>
<P>In 1873 Philotheos Bryennios, then Head Master of the higher Greek school at 
Constantinople, but now Metropolitan of Nicomedia, discovered a remarkable 
collection of manuscripts in the library of the Jerusalem Monastery of the Most 
Holy Sepulchre at Constantinople. This collection is bound in one volume, and 
written by the same hand. It is signed "Leon, notary and sinner," and bears the 
Greek date of 6564 = A.D. 1056. There is no reason to doubt the age of the 
manuscripts. The documents have been examined by Professor Albert L. Long of 
Robert College, Constantinople; and some of the pages, reproduced by photography, were published by the Johns 
Hopkins University, Baltimore, April, 1885. The jealousy of its guardians does 
not imply any lack of confidence in the age and value of the Codex. The contents 
of the 120 folios (240 pp.) are as follows:-</P>
<P>I. Synopsis of the Old and New Testaments, by St. Chrysostom (fol. 1-32).</P>
<P>II. The Epistle of Barnabas (fol. 33-51<I>b</I>).</P>
<P>III. The two Epistles of Clement to the Corinthians (fol. 
51<I>b</I>-76<I>a</I>).</P>
<P>IV. The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (fol. 76<I>a</I>-80).</P>
<P>V. The Epistle of Mary of Cassoboli to Ignatius (fol. 81-82<I>a</I>).</P>
<P>VI. Twelve Epistles of Ignatius (fol. 82<I>a</I>-120<I>a</I>).</P>
<P>The last part of fol. 120<I>a</I> contains the signature and date; then 
follows an account of the genealogy of Joseph, continued on the other page of 
the leaf.</P>
<P>Schaff (p. 6) gives a facsimile of fol. 120<I>a</I>.</P>
<P>Of these, I. supplies some unpublished portions, and furnishes matter for 
textual criticism. II. gives the second Greek copy of Barnabas, also furnishing 
new readings. III. is very valuable; the text of both Epistles is now complete. 
Two-fifths of that of the second was previously unknown. The value for purposes of textual criticism is also great. IV. is the 
<I>Teaching</I>, the value of which is discussed below. V. and VI. both belong 
to the Ignatian literature, and furnish new readings, which have already 
appeared in the editions of Funk (<I>Opera Patr. Apost.</I>, ii., Tübingen, 
1881) and Lightfoot (<I>Epistles of St. Ignatius</I>, London and Cambridge, 
1885).</P>
<P align=center><A name=P4925_1842255></A><FONT size=3>Section 2.-Publication of 
the Discovered Works: the Effect.</FONT></P>
<P>In 1875 Bryennios, who had been chosen Metropolitan of Serrae during his 
absence at the Old Catholic conference in Bonn, published at Constantinople the 
two Epistles of Clement, with prolegomena and notes; giving the text found in 
the Jerusalem Codex, as he termed it. All patristic scholars welcomed his work, 
which bore every mark of care and learning; showing the results of his contact, 
as a student, with German methods. Bishop Lightfoot and many others at once made 
use of this new material. The remaining contents of the Codex were named in the 
volume of Bryennios, and some interest awakened by the mention of the 
<I>Teaching</I>. The learned Metropolitan furnished new readings from other 
parts of the Codex to German scholars. At the close of 1883 he published in 
Constantinople the text of the <I>Teaching</I>, with prolegomena and notes. A 
copy of the volume was received in Germany in January, 1884; was translated into 
German, and published Feb. 3, 1884; translated from German into English, and 
published in America, Feb. 28, 1884; Archdeacon Farrar published 
(<I>Contemporary Review</I>) a version from the Greek in May, 1884. Before the 
close of the year the literature on the subject, exclusive of newspaper 
articles, covered fifty titles (given by Schaff) in Western Europe and 
America. </P>
<P align=center><A name=P4929_1843660></A><FONT size=3>Section 3.-Contents of 
Teaching, and Relation to Other Works.</FONT></P>
<P>In the Babel of conflicting opinions, it is best to notice first the obvious 
internal phenomena. The first part of the <I>Teaching</I> (now distinguished as 
chaps. i.-vi.) sets forth the duty of the Christian; in chaps. vii.-x., xiv., we 
find a directory for worship; chaps. xi.-xiii., xv., give advice respecting 
church officers, extraordinary and local, and the reception of Christians; the 
closing chapter (xvi.) enjoins watchfulness in view of the coming of Christ, 
which is then described.</P>
<P>The amount of matter is not so great as that of the Sermon on the Mount.</P>
<P>The peculiarities of language are marked, but can only be indicated here in 
footnotes. They point to a period of transition from New-Testament usage to that 
of ecclesiastical Greek. The citations from the Scriptures resemble those of the 
Apostolic Fathers. The Gospel of Matthew is most frequently used, especially 
chaps. v.-vii. and xxiv.; but some of the passages fairly imply a knowledge of 
the Gospel of Luke. There are some remarkable correspondences with expressions 
and thoughts found in the Gospel of John, while there is good reason for 
inferring the writer's acquaintance with all the groups of Pauline Epistles. His 
allusions to the other New-Testament books are less marked. There is nothing to 
prove that he did not know all of our canonical books. If an early date is 
accepted, the tone of the whole opposes the tendency-theory of the Tübingen 
school.</P>
<P>The most striking internal phenomena are, however, the correspondences of 
this document with early Christian writings, from A.D. 125 to the fourth 
century. With the so-called <I>Epistle to Barnabas</I>, chaps. xviii.-xx., the 
resemblances are so marked as to demand a critical theory which can account for 
them. A few passages in the <I>Shepherd of Hermas</I> show some resemblance; but 
only two sentences, in Commandment Second, are verbally the same. There is a 
still greater agreement with the so-called <I>Apostolical Church Order</I>, of 
Egyptian origin, probably as old as the third century. It is now known in the 
Coptic (Memphitic), and also in Arabic and Greek. The first thirteen canons correspond quite closely, both in order and words, 
with chaps. i.-iv. of the <I>Teaching.</I></P>
<P>Most noteworthy, however, is the parallel with the <I>Apostolic 
Constitutions</I>, vii. 1-32, which contain more than half the <I>Teaching</I>, 
in precisely the same order, with very close verbal resemblances. The parts 
omitted are in most cases such as had lost their pertinence in the fourth 
century, while they seem appropriate to a much earlier period. The details will 
be found in the footnotes to the <I>Teaching</I> in this volume. These phenomena 
have called forth voluminous discussions, and are the most important facts in 
determining the authenticity and age of the <I>Teaching.</I></P>
<P align=center><A name=P4937_1846618></A><FONT size=3>Section 
4.-Authenticity.</FONT></P>
<P>By this is meant, in this case, the substantial identity of the recently 
discovered document with the work known and referred to by early Christian 
writers under the same (or a similar) title. Of apostolic origin no one should 
presume to speak, since the text of the document makes no such claim, and 
internal evidence is obviously against such a suggestion. On the other hand, 
there is no reason for doubting the age of the Codex, or the accuracy of the 
edition published by Bryennios.</P>
<P>Eusebius (<I>d</I>. 340) of Caesarea, in the famous passage of his history 
(iii. 25) which treats of the canonical books of the New Testament, names among 
the "spurious" works (<FONT face=SPIonic>noxqoi</FONT>) "the so-called 
<I>Teachings of the Apostles</I>" (<FONT face=SPIonic>tw=n a0posto/lwn ai9 
lego/menai didaxai/</FONT>), The plural form does not forbid a reference to the 
work under discussion, since Athanasius (<I>d</I>. 373) has a notice clearly 
pointing to the same writing, in which he uses the singular (Festal Epistle, 
39). Rufinus (<I>d</I>. 410) speaks of a brief work called <I>The Two Ways</I>, 
or <I>The Judgment of Peter</I>; and this fact, in view of the contents of the 
<I>Teaching</I>, furnishes one of the most important data for the critical 
discussion. The last notice of the <I>Teaching</I> was made by Nicephorus 
(<I>d</I>. 828) more than two hundred years before Leon made this copy. Clement 
of Alexandria (<I>d. circa</I> 216) and Irenaeus (<I>mart.</I> 202) use 
expressions that may indicate an acquaintance with this writing. The more 
extended correspondences with Barnabas and later disciplinary works are noticed 
above (sec. 3). The existence of an old Latin translation of the 
<I>Teaching</I>, of the tenth century, a fragment of which has been preserved, 
furnishes general evidence to the authenticity of the Greek copy, but by its 
variations suggests the presence of many textual corruptions. Its closer 
correspondence with Barnabas has led to the theory that the translator used both 
documents. Others suppose that its form points to a document which was the 
common source of the Greek form of the <I>Teaching</I> and of Barnabas.</P>
<P>The various theories based on the above facts cannot even be stated. The 
following positions seem, on the whole, most tenable:-</P>
<P>1. The Greek Codex presents substantially the writing referred to by Eusebius 
and Athanasius.</P>
<P>2. Owing to an absence of other copies, we cannot determine the purity of the 
text; but there is every probability of many minor corruptions.</P>
<P>3. This probability calls for care that we do not infer too much from verbal 
resemblances.</P>
<P>4. The resemblances to book vii., <I>Apostolic Constitutions</I>, are, 
however, of such a character as establish, not only a literary connection 
between the two works, but also the priority of the <I>Teaching.</I></P>
<P>5. In the case of Barnabas, the resemblances can be accounted for (<I>a</I>) 
by accepting the priority of the <I>Teaching</I>, or (<I>b</I>) by assuming a 
common (earlier and unknown) source, or (<I>c</I>) by accepting the priority of 
Barnabas, and assuming such corruptions in the Greek copy of the <I>Teaching</I> 
as will account for the supposed marks of its priority. Despite the general 
adoption of (<I>a</I>), there remains a strong probability that (<I>b</I>) is 
the correct solution of the problem.</P>
<P>6. The <I>Duae Viae</I>, spoken of by Rufinus, may be the common source. We 
have no positive evidence, but the "two ways" form so prominent a topic in most 
of these documents which indicate literary relationship, as to encourage this 
theory. If there was a common source, it probably contained only matter similar 
to chaps. i.-v., which was variously used by the subsequent compilers. Here a 
number of theories have been suggested. None of them, however, necessarily call for a very late date of the 
<I>Teaching</I>, or compel us to deny that Eusebius and Athanasius referred to 
substantially the same work as that now existing in the Codex at Constantinople. 
Many resemblances have been noticed in other works. Probably in the course of a 
few years all the data will have been collected, and a well-defined result based 
upon them. But, even in this period of discussion, there is remarkable agreement 
among critics in regard to the main question of authenticity.</P>
<P align=center><A name=P4949_1850846></A><FONT size=3>Section 5.-Time and Place 
of Composition.</FONT></P>
<P>Granting the general authenticity of the Greek work, the time of composition 
must be at least as early as the first half of the second century. If the 
<I>Teaching</I> is older than Barnabas, then it cannot be later than A.D. 120. 
If both are from a common source, the interval of time was probably not very 
great. The document itself bears many marks of an early date:-</P>
<P>(1) Its simplicity, almost amounting to childishness, not only 
discountenances all idea of forgery, but points to the sub-apostolic age, during 
which Christianity manifested this characteristic. The fact is an important one 
in the discussion of the canon of the New Testament.</P>
<P>(2) The undeveloped Christian thought, as well as the indications of 
undeveloped heresy, confirms this position. Christianity was at first a life, for which the Apostles 
furnished a basis of revealed thought. But the Christians of the sub-apostolic 
age had not consciously assimilated the thought to any large extent, while their 
ethical striving was stimulated by the gross sins surrounding them. </P>
<P>(3) The Church polity indicated in the <I>Teaching</I> is less developed than 
that of the genuine Ignatian Epistles, and shows the existence of extraordinary 
travelling teachers ( "Apostles" and "Prophets," chap. xi.). This points to a 
date not later than the first half of the second century, probably as early as 
the first quarter. </P>
<P>Most of these phenomena would, however, consist with a date as late as that 
of the Ignatian Epistles on the theory that the <I>Teaching</I> was written for 
a community of Christians in some obscure locality. But this theory must admit 
that there existed for a long time great variety of Church polity and 
worship. Of this there is, indeed, considerable evidence. The undeveloped form of the 
doctrinal elements of the work constitutes the most serious objection to the 
theory of a late origin. On the other hand, it seems on many accounts improbable 
that the work, in its present form, was written earlier than the beginning of 
the second century: (1) Such a document would not be penned during the lifetime 
of any of the Apostles. (2) There is no allusion in chap. xvi. to the 
destruction of Jerusalem. If the author was a Jewish Christian, as seems most 
probable, such silence implies an interval of at least one generation. (3) The 
position of the document in the Codex is <I>after</I> the Clementine Epistles, 
and <I>before</I> the Ignatian. This probably marks the chronological position. 
(4) The extreme simplicity scarcely consists with the view that the author was 
nearly contemporary with the Apostles.</P>
<P>Bryennios and Harnack assign, as the date, between 120 and 160; Hilgenfeld, 
160 and 190; English and American scholars vary between A.D. 80 and 120. Until 
the priority to Barnabas is more positively established, the two may be regarded 
as of the same age, about 120, although a date slightly later is not impossible. 
All attempts to discover the author are, with our present lack of data, 
necessarily futile. Even the region in and for which it was composed cannot be 
determined. Jewish-Christian tendencies are not sufficiently indicated to 
warrant the assumption of a polemical aim. The document has been assigned to Alexandria, to Antioch, to Jerusalem; indeed, 
many other places have been named. In favour of the Syrian origin is the 
literary connection with the <I>Apostolic Constitutions</I>, while the 
correspondences with the Epistle to Barnabas suggest Egypt as the locality. If 
the <I>Teaching</I> and Barnabas have a common basis, e.g., the <I>Duae 
Viae</I>, the last may be assigned to Egypt, and the <I>Teaching</I>, in its 
present form, to Syria. The Palestinian origin is urged by those who lay stress 
upon the absence of Pauline doctrine in the <I>Teaching.</I> [If meant for 
catechumens only, this fact is sufficiently accounted for.]</P>
<P>The question is still an open one.</P>
<P>As regards the doctrine, polity, usages, and ethics expressed and implied in 
the <I>Teaching</I>, the reader can judge for himself. The writer is of the 
opinion that the work represents, on many of these points, only a very small 
fraction of the Christians during the second century, and that, while it casts 
some light upon usages of that period, it cannot be regarded as an authoritative 
witness concerning the universal faith and practice of believers at the date 
usually assigned to it. The few notices of it, and its early disappearance, 
confirm this position. The theory of a composite origin also accords with this 
estimate of the document as a whole. </P>
<P>The version of the <I>Teaching</I> here given is that of Professor Isaac H. 
Hall and Mr. John T. Napier, which first appeared in the <I>Sunday-School 
Times</I> (Philadelphia), April 12, 1884. It is now republished by permission of 
the editor of that periodical and of the joint authors. A few slight changes 
have been made, some of them in accordance with suggestions from Professor Hall, 
others to indicate correspondences with book vii of <I>Apostolic 
Constitutions</I>.</P>
<P>The division of verses agrees with that of Harnack as given by Schaff. The 
headings to the chapters have been inserted by the editor. The Scripture 
references have been selected and verified. The notes have been kept within 
narrow limits. They serve to indicate the relation of the matter to that in 
other early writings, mainly the <I>Apostolic Constitutions</I>, and to give 
various readings and renderings. Occasionally explanations and comments have 
been inserted. In dealing with this, as with most other books, the best method 
of study is historico-exegetical. To read the book intelligently is better than 
to read about it. The editor has sought to furnish some help in this method. 
</P>
