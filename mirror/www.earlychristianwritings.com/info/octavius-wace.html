<P id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1><B>Minucius Felix, Marcus,</B> one of the earliest and 
most pleasing of the Latin Christian apologists. His personal history can only 
be gathered from his own book. The earliest writer to mention him by name is 
Lactantius (<I>Institut.</I> v. 1), who describes him as a lawyer, "non 
ignobilis inter causidicos loci," but Lactantius may be merely drawing a natural 
inference from the introduction to the book itself, where Minucius tells how he 
had taken advantage of the court holidays to leave Rome for Ostia, "ad vindimeam 
fenae judiciariam curam relaxaverant." St. Jerome three times mentions Minucius 
(<I>Ep.</I> 48 <I>ad Pammach.</I> vol. i. p. 221; <I>Ep.</I> 70 <I>ad 
Magnum</I>, vol. i. p. 427; <I>de Vir. Illust.</I> c. 58, vol. ii. p. 883), and 
describes him as "insignis causidicus Romani fori"; but it seems clear that 
Jerome drew this description from Lactantius, whom he quotes. It has been 
attempted to deduce the date of Minucius from the place which Jerome assigns him 
in his list of illustrious men; but there is no evidence that Jerome really knew 
more than we know ourselves.<PB id=Page_728 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y"

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Still more may the same be said of Eucherius, who 
speaks of Minucius (<I>Ep. ad Valer.</I> in <I>Patr. Lat.</I> l. 719). The 
<I>gens Minucia</I> was widely spread at Rome, and an inscription (Gruter, p. 
918) shows among its families one with the cognomen Felix.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.1>The only extant work of Minucius is a dialogue 
entitled "Octavius," modelled on the philosophical works of Cicero, whose 
writings, particularly <I>de Natura Deorum</I> and <I>de Divinatione</I>, 
Minucius has carefully studied. Minucius recalls a conversation of his lately 
deceased friend Octavius which resulted in the conversion to Christianity of 
their common friend Caecilius. He tells how Octavius had come to Rome, and gives 
a charming description of the morning walk on the beach taken by the three 
friends after they had gone from Rome to Ostia, until at last they sat down for 
rest and serious discussion on large stones placed for protection of the baths. 
At the beginning of the walk the heathen Caecilius, as they were passing an 
image of Serapis, had saluted it, as was customary, by kissing hands, whereupon 
Octavius charged Minucius with culpable negligence in having allowed his friend 
to continue in such degrading superstition. Caecilius challenges Octavius to a 
formal dispute.. The little treatise then divides itself into two parts, 
containing first a lively attack by Caecilius on the Christian doctrines and 
practices, then a reply, about twice as long, by Octavius, refuting and 
retorting the heathen arguments. Each point of the attack is dealt with in 
order. Caecilius confesses himself vanquished, gladly ranging himself on the 
conquering side.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.2>The following is an abstract of the arguments used by 
Caecilius on the heathen side. He censures the presumption of the Christians, 
who, though unlettered men, venture to pronounce positively on questions about 
which the greatest philosophers have doubted; he denies that there is any good 
ground for believing in the existence of a God, since the chance concourse of 
atoms will sufficiently account for the origin of the world, while the 
prosperity of the wicked and the misfortunes of the good shew that the world is 
governed by no Providence. Then shifting his ground, he urges the duty of 
worshipping the gods whom their ancestors had worshipped, and the folly of 
rejecting what universal experience and the consent of all nations had found to 
be salutary. Each nation had its peculiar god: the Romans, the most religious of 
all, worshipped gods of all nations, and so had attained the highest prosperity. 
The power of their deities bad been exhibited in many oracles and prodigies; 
only one or two philosophers had ventured to deny their agency, and one of 
these, Protagoras, had in consequence been banished by the Athenians. Was it not 
then deplorable that the gods should be assailed by men of the dregs of the 
people, who, collecting credulous women and silly men, banded them in a fearful 
conspiracy, cemented by secret and detestable rites? Tales are repeated, for 
some of which the authority of Fronto is cited, of the initiation of Christian 
neophytes by partaking of the blood of a slaughtered infant, and other customary 
charges. If these things were not true, at least the obscurity in which they 
shrouded their rites shewed that they were such as they had cause to be ashamed 
of. These members of an illegal society dreaded to bring their doctrines into 
the light of day; they had no altars, no temples, no images, and were not even 
in their manner of worship like the Jews, the only people besides themselves who 
worshipped that wretched lonely God Who had not been able to save His own people 
from captivity; yet wished to meddle with everything and pry into every thought 
and every action. Nor was this the only absurdity of Christian doctrine. They 
threatened destruction to the world, which always had lasted and was bound 
together by fixed laws, and said that one day it would be burnt up. Yet for 
themselves, who were not eternal like the world, but were seen to be born and 
die, they dared to hope for immortality, and expect that their dust and ashes 
would live again. In the prospect of this imaginary life they gave up all 
enjoyment of their real present life, trusting in a God Whose impotence was 
exhibited in their daily sufferings from which He was unable to save His 
worshippers. In fine, if the Christians had any modesty, let them give up 
philosophy, of which their want of education had made them incapable ; or if 
they must philosophize, let them fallow that greatest of philosophers, Socrates, 
whose maxim was, "What is above us we have nothing to do with," otherwise the 
result will be either the destruction of all religion or the adoption of anile 
superstition.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.3>Octavius replies that a hearing shall not be refused 
to the arguments of Christians because of their low worldly condition. Reason is 
the common property of all men. It is the rich who, intent on their wealth, are 
too often unable to lift their eyes to things divine. Some of those afterwards 
recognized as the greatest philosophers were at first despised as poor and 
plebeian. He then establishes, by the ordinary arguments from the order of the 
universe, the existence and providence and unity of God, confirming his 
conclusions by the authority of various philosophers, whose opinions respecting 
the Deity he extracts from Cicero's treatise. In proof how natural is the belief 
in God's unity, he appeals to the common use of the singular Deus, both in 
common speech and in the writings of the poets. He shews that the gods whom the 
heathen worshipped were but deified men, and exposes the absurdity of the fables 
commonly told of them, the folly of image-worship, and the cruelty and 
licentiousness of the rites by which the gods were honoured. He shews that it is 
false that the Romans owed their prosperity to their religion, since it was by a 
multitude of irreligious acts that their empire grew, and because their original 
native gods, to whom, if to any, must be ascribed the origin of their greatness, 
had been deposed from their position by the adoption of gods of the conquered 
peoples. He traces the source of all idolatry to the operation of the demons 
who, having lost their first estate, desired to draw others into the same ruin 
as themselves, who inspired oracles, wrought fictitious cures and other 
pretended miracles to deceive men, and were also the inventors and instigators

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>the calumnies against Christianity. All this was 
attested by their own confession when exorcised by Christians. Turning to the 
charges made against the Christians, Octavius not only denies and refutes them, 
but retorts them on the heathen, who had been the more ready to believe that 
others had been guilty of them because they had done the like themselves. If the 
Christians had not temples, or images, or altars, it was because they would not 
degrade the majesty of the infinite God by limiting Him to a narrow place. Man 
himself was God's best image, a holy life the best sacrifice that could be 
offered Him. God is invisible, but so is the wind whose effects we witness; so 
is our own soul; the sun itself, the source of all light, we cannot look at. As 
for the Christian doctrines which Caecilius had represented as absurd and 
incredible, different heathen philosophers had taught a future destruction of 
the world by fire or otherwise; some of them had taught a transmigration of 
souls, a doctrine quite as difficult as that of the resurrection of the body and 
less natural. The doctrine of a future life is recommended by countless 
analogies of nature; and though men whose lives are bad dislike to believe in 
future retribution, and prefer to think that death ends all, yet the current 
popular belief in Pyriphlegethon and Styx, a belief derived from information 
given by demons and from the Jewish prophets, shews how deep-seated is the 
conviction that the time will come when it shall not be well with the wicked. 
Nor is it to be thought that God deals ill with His worshippers because He does 
not give them a larger share of prosperity in this life: the Christians do not 
covet earthly riches; they look on trials as their discipline, persecutions as 
their warfare, in which they are not deserted by their God, but combat under His 
eye. The Romans honour with their praises such sufferers as Mucius Scaevola and 
Regulus, yet the heroism of these men has been repeatedly surpassed by that of 
Christian women and children. Lastly, we need not be disturbed by the failure of 
sceptical philosophers to arrive at any certain knowledge of truth. These men's 
lives gave the lie to their professions of wisdom; we, whose excellence is in 
life and not merely in word, may boast that we have succeeded in finding what 
they sought in vain, and have only cause for gratitude that a revelation was 
reserved for our hands which was denied to them.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.4>It will be seen how meagre Minucius is in his 
exposition of Christian doctrine, thus differing from all the other apologists. 
The doctrines of the unity of God, the resurrection of the body, and future 
retribution make up nearly the whole of the system of Christian doctrine which 
he sets forth. The doctrine of the Logos, so prominent in the apologies of 
Justin, Athenagoras, and Tertullian, is absent; our Lord's name is not 
mentioned, and though from the manner in which Octavius repels the charge that 
the Christians worshipped a man who had been punished for his crimes, it may 
reasonably be inferred that he believed our Lord to be more than man, yet this 
is not plainly stated. Minucius clearly shews that the topics he omits are 
excluded, not from disbelief in, or ignorance of, them, but from a designed 
limitation of the objects of his work, because at the end, when Caecilius has 
declared himself satisfied on the main questions of the existence of God and of 
Providence and of the general truth of the Christian religion, he asks for 
another conversation, not because of remaining doubts, but because he desires to 
be taught other things still necessary to perfect instruction. It cannot be 
accident that Minucius does not imitate the entire unreserve with which Justin 
speaks of Christian doctrines and Christian rites. The work of Minucius was 
doubtless intended mainly to influence intelligent heathen; and we must infer 
that in the West at least the feeling prevailed when Minucius wrote which made 
Christians fear to cast their pearls before swine. One striking difference 
between Minucius and Justin is the former's complete omission of the argument 
from prophecy, yet the inspiration of the Jewish prophets is incidentally 
recognized (c. 35). Minucius never mentions the writings of either O. or N. T., 
and has scarcely any coincidence of language with them. There is (c. 29) an echo 
of <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Jeremiah+17:5," 
id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.5>Jer. xvii. 5</A>, and perhaps (c. 34) of <SCRIPREF 
id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.6 passage="I. Cor. xv. 36, 42">I. Cor. xv. 36, 
42</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.xxxvi.p1.7>His date is generally agreed to have been before 250, 
somewhere about which time Cyprian published his <I>de Idolorum Vanitate</I>, in 
which large use is made of Minucius. A nearer limit depends on settling the 
relation of Minucius to Tertullian. His dialogue and the apology of Tertullian 
have in common so many arguments, sometimes in nearly the same words, that one 
of the two undoubtedly used the work of the other, but as to which was the 
follower critics have held opposite opinions. The difficulty is mainly caused by 
the excellent use both writers have made of their materials, whencesoever 
obtained, and the thoroughness with which they have incorporated them. We have 
already shewn the perfect workmanship of the dialogue of Minucius. Tertullian's 
<I>Apology</I> is equally excellent, though its plan is entirely different. It 
is an advocate's speech, written for presentation to heathen magistrates to 
convince them that Christians did not deserve persecution. It is more loosely 
constructed, and evidently more hastily written, than that of Minucius, but 
bears a strong stamp of originality. Many points briefly touched on in Minucius 
are expanded in Tertullian, so that either Minucius has abridged Tertullian or 
Tertullian has used and developed the suggestions of Minucius. This has 
furnished the best argument for the priority of Tertullian. Tertullian, it has 
been said, is one of the most original of writers, Minucius quite the reverse. 
We have already mentioned his obligations to Cicero; his work is also largely 
indebted to Seneca, besides containing traces of Juvenal and other writers. Is 
it not, then, most natural to believe that as he has drawn his arguments for 
Theism from Cicero, he has taken his defence of Christianity from Tertullian? In 
the common matter there are considerable differences as to arrangement and form 
of expression. If Tertullian were the original, Minucius would have a change of 
arrangement forced on him by the plan of his work, while the changes in form of 
expression either improve the Latinity or make the sentence more pointed;

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>if Minucius were the original, Tertullian's changes can 
hardly have any other object than to disguise his obligation. Notwithstanding, a 
very careful comparison of the common matter led Ebert (<I>K. Sächs. Ges. der 
Wissenschaften; philol.-histor. Classe</I>, Bd. v.) to consider Minucius the 
original, and Ebert's ability in arguing the case obtained for a time general 
acceptance of his opinion. But recently new evidence has been obtained. The 
dialogue would seem to describe Minucius as a native of Cirta and 
fellow-townsman of Fronto, of whom he speaks as "Cirtensis noster," while 
Octavius refers to him as "Fronto tuus." Now at Cirta (Constantine in Algeria) 
the French have found six inscriptions containing the name of Caecilius Natalis 
(Mommsen, <I>Lat. Insc.</I> viii. 6996 and 7094-7098). This Caecilius was chief 
magistrate of Cirta in 210, and on the completion of five years of office raised 
at his own expense a triumphal arch in honour of Caracalla, brazen statues in 
honour of "Indulgentia domini nostri," exhibited "ludos scenicos" for seven 
days, and in other ways exhibited munificence. See an art. by Dessau 
(<I>Hermes</I>, 1880, p. 471). We see no good reason for refusing to identify 
this Caecilius Natalis with the Caecilius of the dialogue. He is not likely to 
have been a Christian when discharging the functions just described; the 
conversation related by Minucius would therefore have occurred somewhat later 
than 215; and the composition itself might be a score of years later. We thus 
fall back on the opinion held by the best critics before the publication of 
Ebert's memoir, that the work of Minucius was written in the peaceful days of 
Alexander Severus, say A.D. 234.</P>
