<UL>The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that John's was a maverick 
  Christian group, and that the nature and quality of this group can be seen in 
  the nature and quality of the language used in the gospel. By employing 
  insights from speech accommodation theory, antilanguage perspectives and the 
  sociolinguistics of intimacy, one can establish the general lines of the 
  Johannine association that might assist in a more adequate interpretation of 
  this gospel.</UL><BR><BR>
<HR>
<BR><BR><FONT size=4>1. Introduction</FONT><BR>
<DD>Beginners in New Testament Greek often start with the document called the 
gospel of John (= John). To many, John's language is distinctive if only because 
it is simpler than that of any other New Testament writing. John has a rather 
straightforward vocabulary and syntax. But vocabulary and syntax are at the 
wording level of language (<A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 1978). 
Language is a three-tiered affair both for the sociolinguist and for the 
ordinary person. People often speak of changing wording that is too harsh or too 
weak, but yet imparting the same meaning. Such a perspective intimates that 
language consists of (a) soundings/spellings that (b) realize wordings that (c) 
realize meanings. The soundings and spellings are quite concrete; they are in 
fact the only dimension of language that impacts on the senses. The next level, 
wording is about patterning soundings and spellings. Wording patterns range from 
textual forms, through sentence forms, to word forms. The third level, meaning, 
is the socially significant feature expressed and realized by means of wording 
which is realized by means of sounding and spelling. Given the experience of 
human beings as essentially social beings, those meanings come from and in fact 
constitute the social system. This three-tiered model of language would have the 
Bible reader ask: What social system or social meaning is being expressed in the 
textual wordings realized in the spellings of biblical documents?<BR>
<DD>It seems easy to learn Greek wording by analyzing and memorizing the 
patterns that emerge in John's gospel since they are so few in number. But 
wording is not meaning. Rather wording is the way humans realize and express 
meaning in language. The meanings themselves derive from some social system. 
Often beginning Greek students learn to express meanings from their own social 
system by means of the wording and spelling found in John's gospel. In this 
sense, they learn to speak English in Greek. The question basic to a considerate 
interpretation, of course, is how to recover the social system of the author so 
as to understand that author's meanings conveyed in the wording and spelling of 
the document.<BR>
<DD>On the other hand, at the wording level, the document called John is a text; 
it is a meaningful configuration of language intended to communicate. We know it 
is intended to communicate—and not just a bunch of doodling—because people in 
our social system told us it is a gospel. This they learned from people before 
them, ranging back, presumably, to the first collectors of such works in the 
second century. People speak or produce documents such as gospels in order to 
have some social effect. In fact language is essentially a form of social 
interaction. People direct language at each other each other in order to mean in 
some social context.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>1.1. Considering a Text</FONT><BR>
<DD>Now who spoke John to whom for what purpose? Can social context be inferred 
from the language that people use? Not a few German biblical scholars early in 
this century did attempt to describe the social situation of early Christian 
groups on the basis of the wording level of language, that is the level of the 
patterns of writing and/or speaking, or "literary" forms found in the New 
Testament. While these biblical scholars came up with some fine insights, most 
often their assessment of the social situations available to early Christian 
groups mirrored modern church situation and concerns (preaching, miracles, 
teaching, and the like). They were not much focused on situations and concerns 
of the first-century Mediterranean with its domestic and political religions. 
<BR>
<DD>There was little to correct the trend on the part of linguistics, since 
during this period the study of language was innocent of social concerns.<BR>
<UL>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the study of language focused on 
  explaining why it was that persons could produce an endless stream of novel 
  sentences, many of which had never been uttered by anyone else before, and yet 
  were readily understood by others. The answer at that time was that there were 
  a limited number of, albeit complex, grammatical rules from which an infinite 
  number of sentence can be transformed (<A 
  href="#Gile">Giles and 
  Wiemann</A> 1987:351-52).</UL>This, of course, is the "language without social 
context" approach, replicated in so much literary criticism. Without linguistics 
to break the approach, the many literary critics (structuralists, 
post-modernists, deconstructionists) claimed that the social system whose 
meanings were realized in the wording level of language, in "texts" as they like 
to designate these documents, is not knowable at all. All that one can know from 
a "text" is what one puts into it (see <A 
href="#1995b">Malina</A> 1995b 
forthcoming). And of course this position plays right into the concerns of those 
practical hermaneuticists who have a whole close-of-the- twentieth-century 
agenda to put into the "texts" so they can "discover" it, such as feminists, 
liberationists, Christian zionists, and other contextualists.<BR><BR><FONT 
size=4>1.2. Considering Communication</FONT><BR>
<DD>The fact is all ancient "texts," that is all ancient wordings, once did 
realize meanings from a social system. Now linguists tell us that what persons 
talk about is meaningful to their conversation partners not so much because 
these partners do not know what a speaker (or writer) is going to say, but 
because the partners do know. Any listener or reader has abundant evidence of 
what some speaker or writer is going to say both from his/her knowledge of how 
the language works and from practiced sensibility to what one in fact can say in 
specific situations. Human beings tend to adapt their language to the language 
of those with whom they interact. As a rule, members of various social groups 
can predict the types of meanings that might be exchanged from the situations in 
which speaking takes place. The other side of the coin looks to the speaker (or 
writer). Considerate authors take their audience into account, just like 
considerate conversation partners. Authors develop their scenarios with a view 
to have effect on their readers and/or listeners. There can be little doubt that 
the author of John, whoever he may have been, accommodated his language to his 
audience. This means that he did not invent or create his own distinctive 
language characteristics. John is not the "Maverick Gospel" (thus <A 
href="#Ky">Kysar</A> 1976; rev ed. 
1993) so much as John's audience was the "Maverick Christian Group."<BR>
<DD>As I hope to show rather abundantly, when a speaker or author views his or 
her conversation partners positively, language users inevitably make alterations 
in language so as to draw closer to the listener(s) or reader(s) and to draw the 
listener(s) or reader(s) closer to the language user as they communicate. Such 
drawing closer to one's audience is social convergence. (On the other hand, with 
partners viewed negatively, the language user will utilize a range of language 
features to accentuate differences and thus keep the listener(s) or reader(s) at 
a distance as they communicate. Such drawing away from the audience is social 
divergence.)<BR>
<DD>The importance of giving attention to the way speakers and writers 
accommodate by focusing on convergence (and divergence) in language is further 
underscored by those who view this feature as essential to the activity of 
communication. Consider Rogers' definition of communication in the last edition 
of his work about the communication of innovation:<BR>
<UL>Communication is a process in which participants create and share 
  information with one another in order to reach a mutual understanding. This 
  definition implies that communication is a process of convergence (or 
  divergence) as two or more individuals exchange information in order to move 
  toward each other (or apart) in the meanings they ascribe to certain events 
  (<A href="#Ro">Rogers</A> 
  1983:5).</UL>Obviously, if communication is a process of linguistic convergence 
(or divergence), the distinctive features of this process should be of interest 
to those concerned with biblical interpretation.<BR>
<DD>In this essay, I consider the gospel of John as an instance of 
communication. I hope to show how one might come to know a group such as John's 
from the document that bears his name. Secondly, I wish to underscore some of 
the characteristic features of this group, again on the basis of John's 
communication. A theory that allows an investigator to envision an audience from 
a piece of communication is called speech accommodation theory. And the path I 
will follow to highlight the characteristic features of John's group consists of 
two dimensions of sociolinguistics called antilanguage and the language of 
intimacy.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2. Speech Accommodation Theory</FONT><BR>
<DD>Speech accommodation theory is based on the previously noted fact that human 
beings tend to adapt their language to the language of those with whom they 
interact. The theory deals with those cognitive, motivational, and affective 
processes that underlie the way in which persons adapt to another's use of 
language or accentuate linguistic differences.<BR>
<UL>SAT [Speech Accommodation Theory], developed by Giles and associates, 
  focuses on the social cognitive processes mediating individuals' perceptions 
  of the environment and their communicative behaviors. Its theoretical 
  framework developed out of a wish to demonstrate the value and potential of 
  social psychological concepts and processes for understanding the dynamics of 
  speech diversity in social settings. It purports to clarify the motivations 
  underlying, as well as the constraints operating upon, speech shifts during 
  social interactions and the social consequences of these. Specifically it 
  originated in order to elucidate the cognitive and affective processes 
  underlying speech convergence and divergence, although other speech strategies 
  (for example, speech complementarity and speech competition) have come into 
  its theoretical purview more recently (<A 
  href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
  1987:14).</UL>
<DD>The central notion of the Speech accommodation theory framework is that as 
they speak or as they write, those who communicate are motivated to adjust or to 
accommodate their linguistic styles to their audience as a strategy for gaining 
various social goals. Given the fact that the author of John is a first-century 
Mediterranean, for example, we can be sure he communicated with his group to 
evoke their social approval as well as to maintain their positive assessment of 
his social identity. Furthermore, he certainly sought to be effective in his 
communicational endeavor with the group to which he was so attached. After all 
"love" is group attachment. It was John's perception of his audience's language 
style that determined his evaluation of what his own appropriate style should be 
for the telling of his story. People constantly judge and assess their 
interlocutors or audience. They wish to be accepted and understood by their 
audience, and they seek to come away from the interaction with a positive self- 
assessment. In Mediterranean terms, to even write a document like the gospel of 
John is nothing less than to challenge the honor of one's fellows (and enemies 
as well) (see <A 
href="#1993">Malina</A> 1993: 
28-60). Simply as an author (that is, apart from concerns for being considerate 
of the audience), the author of John sought to allay the challenge quality of 
his presentation and transformed it into a group product to be shared rather 
than a gift requiring reciprocity. I think anyone who understands Mediterranean 
society will admit this (unless they postulate that John was insane). He carried 
off this transformation by techniques of accommodation, notably linguistic 
convergence with a view to audience acceptance—thus maintaining his own sense of 
honor. He equally underscored features of interpersonal intimacy—thus totally 
defusing any challenge quality in the work.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.1. Linguistic 
Convergence</FONT><BR>
<DD>Adaptation to another's use of language is called linguistic convergence 
(while the accentuation of differences is called linguistic divergence). People 
who intend to communicate converge to where they believe their partners are 
linguistically located for both intellectual reasons (to make sense and have 
effect) and affective reasons (to demonstrate solidarity, loyalty, commitment). 
Language convergence is often cognitively mediated by stereotypes of one's 
language partners. For in their desire to be considerate, speakers and writers 
have to work from socially categorized images of how others will use language 
(children, retarded, elderly, blind, foreigners). People learn how to converge 
with their interlocutors in the process of enculturation.<BR>
<DD>In John's case, the author adequately revealed who he thought his audience 
was and what sort of language they would understand. For it surely makes sense 
for us to believe John's original audience could follow the author in his 
assessment of the personages and interactions depicted in the gospel's various 
stories. And we can be sure this audience also shared his stereotypes of the 
gospel's range of characters and their reaction to what Jesus said and did. The 
gospel offers a fine sampling of various persons converging and diverging with 
Jesus' statements. However, as I will later demonstrate, it was not so much by 
general enculturation in the prevailing social system that John's audience could 
follow him. Rather it was by resocialization in the Johannine group that they 
acquired the ability needed to follow John's gospel. Convergence, thus, reflects 
an author's desire for social integration or identification with the group. The 
gospel of John provided members of the Johannine group with a verbal repertoire 
and verbal flexibility to modify and maintain their own language patterns so 
that they might better fit into the group.<BR>
<UL>Trudgill suggests that lexical shifts probably precede grammatical and 
  phonological convergence and that the latter also may be inhibited by 
  difficulties in restructuring as well as by a desire to avoid loss of contrast 
  and strongly stereotyped features. Thus different speakers may adopt different 
  convergent strategies as well as having different purposes for so doing (<A 
  href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
  1987:21).</UL>John's vocabulary would mirror the lexical selections in vogue 
among his associates. The distinctiveness of this vocabulary would indicate that 
other Christian associations did not converge in this regard. As a matter of 
fact, given what the author of 1 John writes, it would seem that that document 
emerged as a sort of linguistic broker. 1 John was written to compensate for the 
apparent lack of understanding of what John was about and to promote solidarity 
and empathy. 1 John was written to bridge the communicational gaps between that 
document's audience and John's gospel, so as not to detract from optimal 
outcomes sought by the gospel.<BR>
<UL>Convergence has been defined as a linguistic strategy whereby individuals 
  adapt to each other's language by means of a wide range of linguistic 
  features, including language rates, pauses and utterance length, 
  pronunciations and so on. Divergence refers to the way in which speakers 
  accentuate vocal differences between themselves and others. Both of these 
  linguistic shifts may be either upward or downward, where the former refers to 
  a shift in a societally valued direction and the later refers to modifications 
  toward more stigmatized forms (<A 
  href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
  1987:14).</UL>Considerate speakers and authors are masters of language 
accommodation. They know how to converge with their audience (see <A 
href="#1991">Malina</A> 1991). 
Given the preponderant interpersonal focus of John, the author of this document 
was undoubtedly a considerate author, that is one who was person-centered, 
receiver-focused, rhetorically sensitive. In the hands (or mouth) of a 
considerate author, language convergence is an active communicative strategy. 
Convergence facilitates interaction-maintenance and goals. Now, whether 
consciously or automatically and unawares, John applied a convergence script (or 
schema or scenario) to move toward the language he shared with his fellow group 
members.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.2. Linguistic Divergence</FONT><BR>
<DD>Language divergence is a symbolic tactic for maintaining intergroup 
distinctiveness. While language convergence erases intergroup boundaries, 
divergence underscores intergroup markers and division. Simply put, whoever did 
not speak "Johannine" was not a member of John's group. If John's language and 
style were so distinctive, that is because John's group was quite distinctive, 
hence set apart and divided from all other contemporary groups, Christian, 
Israelite and Hellenistic. Thus language divergence and convergence are "a more 
subtle measure in studies of in-group bias" (<A 
href="#Me">Messick and Mackie</A> 
1989). People use language styles as a symbolic tactic for maintaining identity, 
ideological focus, cultural pride and distinctiveness.<BR>
<DD>This tactic, so evident in John once one reads the Synoptics, marks a 
refusal to converge. Divergence is dis-accommodation. Dis-accommodation 
accentuates the linguistic and social differences between ingroup and outgroup. 
Such accentuation maintains social integrity, distance and identity.<BR>
<UL>It is likely that there is a hierarchy of strategies for psycholinguistic 
  distinctiveness varying in the degree of social dissociation that they 
  indicate. The range runs from a few pronunciations and content 
  differentiations through forms of accent and dialect divergences to verbal 
  abuse and naming, abrasive humor, and the maintenance or switch to another 
  language in response to an outgroup speaker (<A 
  href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
  1987:30).</UL>Everything depends on the repertoire of wording potential 
(language patterns, syntax, vocabulary) available to the speaker/writer and 
audience.<BR>
<DD>Divergence not only expresses attitudes, but also puts order and meaning 
into the interaction and provides a mutually understood basis for communication. 
Content and discourse differentiation in John and other forms of divergence 
serve to indicate that the speaker is not a member of the larger community or of 
other Christian groups, much less a member in good standing of "this world" or 
of "the Judeans." This is a socially self-handicapping tactic. For when the 
denizens of this world or of Judea or even of other Christian groups assessed 
John's linguistic divergence as purposeful, their accusations of dissidence and 
deviance could not be far behind. Divergence acts as a form of self-disclosure 
to indicate that certain norms and spheres of knowledge and behavior are not 
shared with the outgroup, and that ingroup interactions are at a 
premium.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.3. The Foundations of Speech 
Accommodation</FONT><BR>
<DD>Giles and his associates believe that a study of accommodation phenomena is 
worthwhile if only because such phenomena pervade human interaction. Speech 
accommodation is really communication accommodation (<A 
href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
1987: 41). And communication accommodation is rooted in the following social 
psychological principles: similarity of attraction, causal attribution and 
intergroup processes. Consider each of these principles in turn.<BR><BR><FONT 
size=4>2.3.1. Similarity of Attraction</FONT><BR>
<DD>As one person becomes more similar to another, the greater the likelihood 
that the second will like the first. Interpersonal convergence through language 
is a strategy to this end. The principle of the similarity of attraction 
evidences the fact that the author of John set forth the story of Jesus as he 
did because the people for whom he wrote shared similar modes of perception, 
evaluation and articulation. In sum, they "believed" as he did, hence he writes 
that they "may continue to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God" 
(John 20:31).<BR>
<DD>People converge in language because of their desire for social integration 
or social identification with others. The greater the speaker's or writer's need 
to gain another's approval or attraction, the greater the degree of convergence 
there will be, up to a certain optimal point. Interactants of this sort converge 
both to where they believe others are or even where they expect them to be as 
they carefully lead them along. Increasing similarity in communication increases 
a person's attractiveness, predictability, intelligibility, and interpersonal 
involvements (empiric proof cited by <A 
href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
1987: 17). Apart from the general feature that people are essentially social 
beings, people seek social approval for the following reasons: they will 
probably interact in the future; they wish to have social effect on each other; 
they can empathize; they previously benefitted from convergence; interaction 
fills their individual need for approval. Presumably all of these features 
applied to the author of John as member of the group that shared John's gospel. 
People tend to converge in the direction of those wielding symbols of social 
effectiveness. In other words, speakers converge up to those perceived to wield 
power, wealth, influence or loyalty and solidarity. In our society, for example, 
salesmen converge in the direction of their customers, parish members to clergy, 
soldiers to their officers and the like (<A 
href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
1987: 17, 22-23). Such convergence in the direction of others may mark 
divergence from group of origin. Thus a Christian coming from a Pauline or 
Petrine group would converge in speech usage in the direction of the Johannine 
one. Or such convergence in speech may simply reflect a person's actual social 
location as a member of the John's group.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.3.2. Causal 
Attribution</FONT><BR>
<DD>A second reason for communication accommodation is rooted in the fact that 
people attempt to understand and evaluate the behavior of others in terms of the 
motives and intentions they attribute as being the cause of the behavior. People 
behave as they do because they are motivated to behave that way. When people 
observe behavior of significance to them, they inevitably attribute motives to 
explain the behavior. A motive is a person's capacity to find satisfaction in a 
given state of affairs and a disposition to seek that satisfaction. Motives may 
be self-oriented or other-oriented, group-oriented or societally-oriented (<A 
href="#Za">Zander</A> 1971; 1985). 
In such causal attribution, three factors are involved: the ability of the other 
person, the effort expended by the other person and the external pressures 
impelling the person to act in a particular way.<BR>
<DD>In his assessment of his audience's motives, John would take into account 
the ability and effort of his audience members as well as the social pressures 
that propel their actions. They joined the Johannine group to find satisfaction; 
they were presumably well-disposed to seek satisfaction in that group (on John's 
group as individualistic, see <A 
href="#1986a">Malina</A> 1986a: 
55-61 and passim). Causal attribution would focus our attention on how and in 
what the Johannine group sought and found satisfaction. Presumably this 
satisfaction consisted in their effectively becoming "children of God" (John 
1:12), in experiencing the Spirit (John 19:30) that enabled them to understand 
the real meaning of what Jesus said and did (John 7:39; 14:26: 16:12-13), and in 
performing those even greater works (John 14:12) that Jesus promised to those 
who believe in him as God's revelatory agent. In sum, members of John's 
community saw, that is experienced, God (14:9).<BR>
<DD>On the other hand, throughout the story we have the opportunity to observe 
how John attributes motives to Jesus' opponents. The global opposition of "this 
world" and "the Judeans," and the specific opposition of single groups such as 
the Pharisees and the crowds facilitate John's divergence strategies. John's 
description of persons reacting to Jesus most often present them as 
representatives of different social groups even though they have individual 
names. Thus encounters with Jesus fall along an interindividual—intergroup 
continuum. At the interindividual end, interpersonal relationships and 
individual characteristics are highlighted in the encounter, often a 
conversation. But as the encounter develops beyond the conversation stage, Jesus 
addresses the intergroup dimension. Then members of the outgroup are treated as 
undifferentiated items in a unified social category ("this world," "the 
Judeans"). But ingroup members take on the characteristics of their own group 
("you") in a self-stereotyping way (after Tajfel and Turner, 1979, cited by <A 
href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
1987: 29). These features with their underlying causal attributions are quite 
apparent in the many conversations in John, where dialogue turns into monologue 
(John 3:1–4:42; 5:10ff; 6:22ff; 9:13–10:42; 11:1-44; 11:45–12:36a).<BR><BR><FONT 
size=4>2.3.3. Institutional Norms for Speech Accommodation</FONT><BR>
<DD>Obviously the quality and content of linguistic congruence and divergence 
depend to a large extent upon the institution in which communication takes 
place. In the first century Mediterranean, the overarching institutions were 
kinship and politics. Religion and economics were embedded in these with the 
following results as regards institutional arrangements. There was kinship with 
its domestic religion and domestic economics, and politics with its political 
religion and political economics (<A 
href="#1986b">Malina</A> 1986b; 
1994). What persons talk about is meaningful to their conversation partners 
because these partners know what a speaker or writer is going to say. John is 
writing for a fictive kin group consisting of fellow "disciples," (so unlike 
other New Testament groups which consist of fictive "brothers" and presumably 
"sisters"). First century Mediterranean teachers and their disciples were 
devoted to a way of living, a style of experiencing life that embrace God and 
fellow humans (see <A 
href="#Cu">Culpepper</A> 1975). 
Thus any listener aware of how a teacher and his disciples behaved in society 
would have abundant evidence of what John was going to say both from knowledge 
of how the language works in disciple-based fictive kin-groups, and from 
practiced sensibility to what one in fact can say in generic and specific 
situations of this sort. Johannine disciples took on their roles and developed 
social identities in the group in terms of their understanding of the generic 
institution that disciple-based fictive kinship was. This social identity was 
formed in terms of a central process that includes: social categorization 
(disciple of the teacher, Jesus), identification (living out discipleship), 
social comparison (between ingroup and outgroup discipleship), psychological 
distinctiveness (experiences as children of God). The sequence of stages in this 
process of social identity formation, then, are categorization, identification, 
comparison and distinctiveness. This sequence replicates the stages entailed in 
the foundation of a group (aware, share, compare, declare) as follows. In group 
formation, some individual becomes aware of a problem requiring a group for its 
solution, then shares this awareness with others; others then compare the 
solution with those available in the society and finally accept (or reject) it 
and let others know about it as well (see <A 
href="#1995b">Malina</A> 1995b 
forthcoming).<BR>
<DD>With a new social identity, as members of a new and significant group, a 
person's language usage changes accordingly.<BR>
<UL>When one of an individual's social group memberships is construed as 
  situationally salient, he or she will attempt to differentiate from relevant 
  outgroup individuals on dimensions that are valued as core aspects of their 
  group identity. Should language be a salient dimension of that group 
  membership, as it so often is for ethnic groups, then differentiation by means 
  of language or nonverbal divergence will ensue (on one or more of the 
  following dimensions: language, dialect, slang, phonology, discourse 
  structures, isolated words and phrases, posture, and so on) in order to 
  achieve a positive psycholinguistic distinctiveness (<A 
  href="#Gil">Giles, et al.</A> 
  1987:29, citing Giles, Bourhis and Taylor, 1977).</UL>Often the valued feature 
of a language interaction is the event at which language takes place along with 
the institutional expectations the event signals. Consider, for example, 
response to a question posed by a hostile questioner (John 7:14-24), 
conversation struck up with some unknown person (John 5:2-9), riposte to a 
challenge to one's honor (John 8:48-59), or a challenge directed to an unknown 
opponent (John 6:47-51). Language behavior at such events follows 
sociolinguistic norms for dealing with outgroup persons. Convergence here means 
adherence to strong social norms for dealing with outsiders, not adherence to 
the language-style of the other as though they were fellow ingroup members.<BR>
<DD>The fact is that in language interactions, people are constrained by social 
norms. The distinctiveness of John on the wording level alone clearly indicates 
how constrained he was by his group's norms and his unconcern with the social 
norms prevailing in the outgroup. Again, the language of John is that of the 
Johannine group, the "maverick Christian association." Since the right choice of 
language led to rewards such as increased perceived attractiveness, gains in 
listener's approval, cooperativeness, compliance, we can assume that John's 
right choices yielded social effectiveness. On the other hand, the costs 
involved in his choice involved outgroup evaluations of a negative sort: 
decrease in perceived competence, expended effort, the possible loss of personal 
or social identity, and sanctions accruing from antinormative or nonnormative 
communication. A number of these negative outcomes are alluded to in the story, 
as forecast by Jesus (John 15:20; 16:2).<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.4. Interactant 
Dimensions of Accommodation: Who Is Involved</FONT><BR>
<DD>"Language can reflect intraindividual, interindividual, intergroup and 
institutional characteristics" (<A 
href="#Gile">Giles and Wiemann</A> 
1987: 354). Given the fact that John is a document whose author and audience are 
no longer available for direct scrutiny and given the fact that first-century 
Mediterraneans were anti- introspective, collectivistic personalities (see <A 
href="#1994a">Malina</A> 1994a), I 
would not expect to find any certain intraindividual linguistic features. The 
psycholinguistic data are simply absent, and perhaps not very useful for 
exegetical purposes anyway. However the document does reveal a few interpersonal 
features and a host of intergroup and institutional characteristics sufficient 
for an analysis at a social level.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.4.1. Interindividual 
Dimensions</FONT><BR>
<DD>Interindividual situations are relational, depicting two persons, a couple 
or a dyadic comparison. Here interaction is fully determined by interpersonal 
relationships and individual stereotypical characteristics, and not at all 
affected by various social groups to which interactants belong. From a cognitive 
perspective, initial encounters between people involve the reduction of 
uncertainty. Mutual interrogation followed by self-disclosures allows 
participants to not only make their partner more predictable but engenders more 
certainty about responding "appropriately" themselves (cf. the initial 
encounters in John: e.g., Nathanael 1:43-51; Nicodemus 3:1-15; the Samaritan 
woman 4:7-42). Interpersonal encounters and apparent role relationships 
inevitably have an affective dimension. Address terms point to asymmetrical 
status and power roles. The author's description of aspects of physical features 
in such encounters (e.g., nonverbal distancing patterns, differences in 
interpersonal space, backward or forward lean, differences in gazing patterns) 
equally take on pragmatic significance and point up status and/or solidarity 
differences. Many of these descriptive features are distinctive of John (see 
below 4.6 and 4.7).<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.4.2. Intergroup Dimensions</FONT><BR>
<DD>Group situations depicting outsiders are intergroup interactions. Here 
interactions are fully determined by interactant's memberships in various social 
groups and are not at all affected by interindividual personal relationships. 
The more persons see the interaction as intergroup, the more behavioral 
uniformity do persons display toward outgroup members, and the more they will 
treat them in an undifferentiated manner rather than as individuals. When 
individuals identify with a social group, they desire to derive satisfaction 
from their membership in it. The realization of the affect associated with 
ingroup identity comes through; this results in the expression of intergroup 
comparisons between the position of one's own group and that of other groups on 
such valued dimensions as power, loyalty and solidarity, influence and 
wealth.<BR>
<DD>When a member of a group defines an encounter subjectively as an intergroup 
phenomenon, he or she will wish to assume a positive social identity, by 
differentiation from those who are outgroup members (note the conversation in 
which Peter denies Jesus, John 18:25-26; see <A 
href="#Gile">Giles and Wiemann</A> 
1987: 358). People who wish to join a new group will begin to speak like members 
of that group, dropping the ways of speaking typical of their former group 
affiliations (note the shifts in the Samaritan woman's language as the 
interaction proceeds, John 4:7-26).<BR>
<UL>Indeed it is no accident that cross-culturally what is 'standard,' 
  'correct,' and 'cultivated' language behavior is that of the aristocracy, the 
  upper or ruling classes and their institutions; that is, the language of the 
  most powerful—politically and economically (<A 
  href="#Gile">Giles and 
  Wiemann</A> 1987:361).</UL>Thus second language learning is dramatically 
unidirectional! It is not the socially higher who learn to speak as the lower 
status people, but always the other way around. Hence it was Israelites and 
other Semites who learned Greek. Romans and other Hellenists did not learn 
Hebrew and Aramaic. Significantly, in spite of their roots in first-century 
Israelite society, all Christian documents are written in Greek, the language of 
civilized Hellenism.<BR>
<DD>Social identity, mentioned previously, is concerned with behavior at the 
intergroup level of in terms of highly general, typical features. The more 
individuals define situations in intergroup terms and desire to maintain or 
achieve a positive ingroup identity, the more likely will they diverge in 
language from the other group. In other words, the more a member of the 
Johannine group defined himself or herself as part of that group and sought to 
achieve or maintain a positive ingroup identity, the more that member would 
converge with the discourse mode typical of John. Of course that "disciple" 
would likewise diverge from the discourse mode typical of Matthew, Mark, Luke 
and Paul.<BR>
<DD>For John and his group, Jesus was revealer of God, Son of God who enabled 
those in the association themselves to experience God as children (John 1:12). 
Jesus was not concerned with any theocracy for Israel, there is no proclamation 
of God's kingdom in that gospel. Rather, Jesus was concerned with giving the 
Spirit to all who would believe in God's presence in him (John 19:30; see <A 
href="#Ne">Neyrey</A> 1988: 
182-215). Redemption and salvation are of little concern. The mode of discourse 
that articulated such positions would situate the associates of John's group on 
some intergroup status hierarchy. As an association clearly rejected by the 
Judeans, among other groups, and equally avoided by other Christian associations 
(see 3 John), John's group seems to claim preeminence since it allows for no 
compromise whatsoever. The way it is treated replicates the way in which its 
Lord was treated. John's group claims superiority over other Christian groups, 
expecting them to join the John group ("that they may be one!" John 
17:11).<BR><BR><FONT size=4>2.5. Intermediate Summary</FONT><BR>
<DD>The fact that authors generally tend to accommodate to their audience allows 
us to believe that the author of John tended to converge with his group. Members 
of that group must have formed a maverick Christian association if John's gospel 
made sense to them. Speech accommodation means John's association shared many of 
his viewpoints, attitudes and perspectives, if not everything that he sets 
forth. Given first-century Mediterranean cultural constraints, from a document 
like John we learn nothing of the author, more about the document, but much more 
about the intended receiver.<BR>
<DD>Documents from antiquity are receiver focused in more ways than one. To read 
them from the viewpoint of modern authorship with its focus on the individualism 
of the subject and the paraphernalia of the Romantic period is historically 
inaccurate. John's gospel reveals to us John's community, and the reason for 
this is the author's desire to communicate. Of course the same may be said of 
the rest of the New Testament documents. They reveal precious little of their 
authors, including Paul, regardless of what so many people have said and 
written. And they necessarily, if not exclusively, revealed information about 
the groups to which they were addressed. Those who argue for "community 
authorship" (e.g. <A 
href="#Cu">Culpepper</A> 1975) are 
closer to the truth than those who would single out the personality of the 
author.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3. Antilanguage</FONT><BR>
<DD>To interpret documents requires the interpreter to trace back the meanings 
realized through texts to a culturally and historically appropriate social 
system. The question I wish to consider here is similar to that of traditional 
form critics: what sort of social system does John's wording realize? (see my 
previous treatment, <A 
href="#1985">Malina</A> 1985). 
More narrowly, what sort of situation, what set of concerns, might adequately 
explain the document called the gospel of John? Along with literary critics, 
past and present, I too will begin with the wording level of language, the 
language of text, sentence, and word, of style, syntax, and lexicography. 
Consider some of the features of this document at the wording 
level.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.1. Introduction: John's Wording Level</FONT><BR>
<DD>Perhaps the simplest way to approach John is to note its author's 
distinctive development of and penchant for new words in place of old ones. This 
trait bespeaks language relexicalized, but only partially. Its implicit 
principle seems to be: same grammar but different vocabulary, though only in 
certain areas. And these areas are those of central concern to the focal 
interests and activities of John's group. In John, this concern is articulated 
as follows: "that you may continue to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son 
of God, and that believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31). In other 
words, the author of John is concerned with spelling out the meaning of Jesus of 
Nazareth as Messiah and in developing emotional anchorage "in Jesus" for his 
collectivity. It is to this end that the author develops his very different 
vocabulary.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.1.1. Too Many Words: 
Overlexicalization</FONT><BR>
<DD>Furthermore, John does not simply relexicalize in his area of concern, but 
he overlexicalizes by employing a rather large range of lexical items to cover 
the same area. First of all, note his contrasts between spirit, the above, life, 
light, not of the/this world, freedom, truth, love, and their opposites: flesh, 
the below, death, darkness, the/this world, slavery, lie, hate. These words are 
variants used to describe contrasting spheres of existence, opposing modes of 
living and being. Similarly, and with extremely little appreciable difference in 
meaning, John speaks of "believing into Jesus," or "following" him, of "abiding 
in" him or "loving" him, of "keeping his word," of "receiving" him, or "having" 
him, or "seeing" him.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.1.2. Interpersonal Focus: Not Many 
Ideas</FONT><BR>
<DD>John likewise evidences a distinctive emphasis in the range of meanings 
communicated in the work. Languages can be said to entail three linguistic modes 
of meaning: the ideational, the interpersonal, and the textual. The ideational 
refers to what is being said or described; the interpersonal looks to the 
personal qualities of the communicating partners; and the textual pertains to 
the qualities of any piece of language to form text (such as cohesion). Again, 
what one says is ideational, with whom one speaks is interpersonal and how one 
speaks is textual (see <A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 1978: 
8-36; the model on 69 and its explanation on 125-26). We single out these 
components here because John typically deemphasizes the ideational (what he has 
to say) and focuses solely upon the interpersonal (with whom the conversation 
occurs) and textual (how one speaks). Thus Jesus can be "Revealer," with little 
or nothing to reveal (a solution to the confusion of <A 
href="#Bu">Bultmann</A> 1971: 
passim). For example, a comparison of the text of John (the whole gospel as 
story) with the texts of the Synoptics will readily indicate that John downplays 
the ideational feature of language. For in John there is no progressive 
description of who Jesus is, no progressively mounting opposition from enemies, 
no progressive presentation of Jesus' ministry and teaching, so special "gospel" 
of Jesus, no interest in the "kingdom of Heaven" or on the revitalization of 
Israel. All John really has to say is said in the prologue: We can become 
"children of God" because "God's Utterance has been enfleshed and has taken up 
residence in our midst" (John 1:12, 14). The vignettes in the gospel are 
variations on this theme.<BR>
<DD>On the other hand, John certainly highlights the interpersonal and textual 
functions of language. The linguistic dimensions of how Jesus speaks (textual 
component) and with whom he speaks (interpersonal component), come through in a 
way not found in the Synoptic narratives. Halliday notes that it is these two 
dimensions (interpersonal and textual) that account for overlexicalization. For 
example, overlexicalization based on the textual function of language (how Jesus 
speaks, how others speak to Jesus) is revealed in forms of verbal display such 
as punning and word play. This feature is quite apparent in John's pattern of 
ambiguity, misunderstanding and clarification (John 2:19ff; 3:3ff; 4:10ff; 
4:32ff; 6:33ff; 8:31ff; 8:38ff; 11:11ff; 11:23ff; 13:8ff; 14:4ff; 14:7ff; 
14:21ff; 16:16ff. All of these text-segments reveal verbal display or word plays 
relative to the following: the destruction of the temple, being born again, 
water, food, bread, freedom, father, sleep, resurrection, washing, way, seeing, 
manifestation, a little while—respectively). This feature is likewise manifested 
in John's penchant for irony (John 2:9-10; 4:12; 7:27; 7:42; 7:52; 11:16; 11:36; 
12:19; 13:37; 18:31; 18:38; 19:5; 19:14; 19:19ff.).<BR>
<DD>As for the interpersonal component, overlexicalization deriving from this 
function of language (who is involved, of whom and to whom Jesus speaks) is 
indicated by the set of words that have the same denotation, but have quite a 
different connotation based on the attitude and commitment they entail in an 
interpersonal context. This includes, for example, all the "I am . . . " 
statements previously referred to. The words "bread" (John 6:35), "light" 
(8:12), "door" (10:9), "life" (11:25-26), "way" (14:6), "vine" (15:5) have the 
same denotation in the contexts in which they are employed; they refer to 
various, real world objects. However when identified with Jesus in an "I am . . 
. " proposition, each takes on some interpersonal dimension. The synonyms for 
the activities of discipleship ("to believe, come, abide, follow, love, keep 
words, receive, have, see") and those for the two contrasting realms ("the 
above, spirit," etc., and "the below, flesh," etc. listed previously) point in 
the same direction, i.e. to the interpersonal component of language.<BR>
<DD>This orientation toward the interpersonal and textual modes of the 
linguistic system accounts for the way social values are foregrounded, 
highlighted, and underscored in antilanguage. This sort of emphasis on social 
values indicates that John and his group seek the implementation of new values 
in place of old ones, not new structures. The Synoptics and Paul, on the other 
hand, emphasize new structures in place of old ones. The new structures are 
fictive kin-groups called "church" or "the body of Christ" or those "in Christ" 
and the like. Emphasis on new structures underscores and features the ideational 
mode of the linguistic system. What is in fact happening and what should in fact 
be happening are emphasized, while who is involved and what is said are of 
lesser concern.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.2 Defining Antilanguage</FONT><BR>
<DD>The consistent relexicalization and overlexicalization along with a focus on 
the interpersonal and modal aspect of language point to what Halliday has 
labelled as "antilanguage" (<A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 1978: 
164-82). "Antilanguage" is the language of an "antisociety," that is "a society 
that is set up within another society as a conscious alternative to it. It is a 
mode of resistance, resistance which may take the form either of passive 
symbiosis or of active hostility and even destruction" (Ibid. 171). The 
instances of antilanguage that Halliday studied include the language of 
individuals put into prison as well as into reform schools in Poland, of members 
of the underworld in India, of vagabonds in Elizabethan England. All these 
individuals formed groups that were in fact anti- societies set up within a 
larger, broader society. And in this setting, their language came to express 
their social experience. Antilanguage and antisociety go hand in hand. Or as 
Giblett notes: "There can be no society without language, and no antisociety 
without an antilanguage" (<A 
href="#Gi">Giblett</A> 
1991:1).<BR>
<DD>It is curious to note that antisocieties, as a rule, have a negative 
relation to prevailing custom or law.<BR>
<UL>They are either on the margins of the law, or they have broken the law. 
  They are not outside society, but an outside hollowed within society. They are 
  both objects of the power of the law and subjects of their own 
  counter-language which resists and undermines the power of the law (<A 
  href="#Gi">Giblett</A> 
1991:2).</UL>Just as society is not opposed to antisociety, so too language is 
not opposed to antilanguage. As a matter of fact, users of normal language more 
or less understand antilanguage but miss the full meaning realized by the latter 
since normal language users do not inhabit the antisociety nor share its social 
system. And it is antisociety that is opposed to society, antilanguage to 
language. Halliday notes that "antilanguage arises when the alternative reality 
is a counter-reality, set up in opposition to some established norm" (<A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 1978: 
171).<BR>
<DD>What this means is that the individuals comprising John's group were not 
rejected by their opponents because of anything in John's gospel. The gospel 
does not present the beliefs and attitudes of group members that led to their 
expulsion by others. Rather John's gospel reflects the alternate reality John's 
group set up in opposition to its opponents, notably "this world" and "the 
Judeans." In the eyes of these opponents, John's group was anomalous. Because of 
the way it experienced God (as God's children did, John 1:12, contrary to "this 
world") and because of its believe in Jesus as distinctive Messiah (contrary to 
"the Judeans"), it stood either on the margins of community standards or broke 
those standards. On the margins, John's group was not illegal, but in a space 
which the custom or law did not (or could not) cover because the group was not 
really subject to the law. Or as norm breakers, the group subsisted in an 
outside location hollowed within society. In that location, it was the object of 
the power of community norms, but its members acted as subjects of their own 
antilanguage which resisted and undermined the power of those community norms. 
Like all antilanguage, John's too is "consciously used for strategic purposes, 
defensively to maintain a particular social reality or offensively for 
resistance and protest" (<A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 1978: 
178-79). In other words, an antilanguage is a language deriving from and 
generated by an antisocietal group. And an antisocietal group is an association 
that is set up within a larger society as a conscious alternative to it.<BR>
<DD>The reasons why persons come up with conscious alternatives to the society 
in which they are in some way embedded are varied and many. Sociolinguists can 
suggest a range of reasons. Persons might be labelled as deviant and treated 
with active hostility by members of society at large. Or a given category of 
persons might experience total lack of social concern, resulting in their living 
in the greater society in a state of passive social symbiosis. Or persons might 
be exiled or rejected due to negative outcomes of an uprising or revolt, and 
will have to fend for themselves. Finally, persons might be confined to 
concentration camps, maximum security prisons, restricted wards in mental 
hospitals, and the like.<BR>
<DD>All such persons are variously labelled as deviants: whether sinners, 
unbelievers, apostates, dissidents, subversives, prisoners, inmates or patients. 
As deviants, they often undergo daily and progressive public disconfirmation of 
their ability to act as adult persons. Their movements and choices are 
restricted. In extreme cases, officials of the broader society publicly evaluate 
them in terms of a moral system that socially denies that they are capable of 
being genuine agents on their own behalf. To use contemporary terms, they are 
declared to be non-persons. Their movements and utterances are denied the status 
of significant human actions. Since what they say and do is defined as mere 
behavior, going through meaningless motions, they must be, so it is pronounced, 
without capacities to act in human fashion. Antilanguage and its generating 
alternate society derive from individuals who have experienced socially 
sanctioned depersonalization (see <A 
href="#Har">Harris</A> 
1989:606).<BR>
<DD>In John's case, the document does point to an audience composed of 
individuals that emerged from and stands opposed to society and its competing 
groups. Concretely, the notable groups which John's collectivity opposes include 
Hellenistic society at large, that is, "the (this) world" (79 times in John; 9 
times in Matt and 3 each in Mark and Luke), and Judean society, "the Judeans" 
(71 times in John; 5 times in Matt and Luke; 7 times in Mark). These groups 
adamantly refuse to believe in Jesus as Messiah. <A 
href="#Br">Brown</A> (1979: 
168-69) discerns four more groups in the document: the adherents of John the 
Baptist who do not as yet believe in Jesus, and three groups which claim to 
believe in Jesus: crypto-Christians, Christians from the house of Israel and 
Christians of the apostolic churches. This last group is perhaps "the sheep not 
of this fold" (John 10:16) with which John's group has some relationship through 
the "shepherd." John's antilanguage is a form of resistance to this range of 
competing groups and develops for positive and negative reasons, to be 
considered shortly.<BR>
<DD>Antilanguage is not simply a specialized variety of language such as a 
technical variety of ordinary language used in a special way or in particular, 
technical contexts (e.g., technical jargons, argots and the like). Rather, an 
antilanguage arises among persons in groups espousing and held by alternative 
perceptions of reality, reality as experienced and set up in opposition to some 
established mode of conception and perception. Consequently, an antilanguage is 
nobody's "mother tongue," nor is it a predictable "mother tongue" derivative. 
Rather antilanguage exists solely in a social context of resocialization. Like 
any other language, it is a means of realizing the social (sub-)system and 
cultural script of the group in question, a means of expressing perceptions of 
the reality mediated by that script by actively creating and maintaining that 
reality by means of language. But unlike ordinary language, antilanguage creates 
and expresses a reality that is inherently an alternative reality, one that is 
constructed precisely in order to function as an alternative to society at 
large. In the antilanguage of John, we find the expression of an alternative to 
the society of first century Mediterranean Hellenism in general, and of the 
Judean version of Israelite ideology in particular. John's group is an 
alternative to "this world," and to "the Judeans." Thus what is significant in 
antilanguage is not its distance from the language of Hellenistic Judea, but the 
tension between the two. Both the Hellenistic "Judeans" at large and the 
alternative group share the same overarching system of meaning, just as both are 
part and parcel of the same overarching social system, "this world." Yet they 
stand in opposition to and in tension with each other. The reason for 
underscoring this point is that to appreciate the new values and perceptions 
generated by an antisocietal collectivity, one must understand the larger 
society to which it stands opposed.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.3. The Functions of 
Antilanguage</FONT><BR>
<DD>What uses do antilanguages serve? Halliday observes that antilanguages are 
generally replications of social forms based on highly distinctive values that 
are clearly set apart from those of the society from which antisocietal members 
derive. Like language itself, antilanguage is the bearer of social reality, but 
of an alternative social reality that runs counter to the social reality of 
society at large. Thus antilanguage serves to maintain inner solidarity (= 
"love") under pressure. The pressure, of course, stems from the surrounding 
broader society from which group members originally came and in which they are 
to a large extent still embedded. Furthermore, for individuals to maintain 
solidarity with their fellow antisocietal members and not fall back into the 
margins of the groups from which they left or were ejected, some sort of 
alternative ideology along with emotional anchorage in the new collectivity is 
necessary. This necessity is best served by demonstrations of mutual care and 
concern on the part of those in the antisocietal group so as to establish strong 
affective identification on the part of newcomers into the group as well as 
those on its fringes ready to swing out. Of course, this describes the process 
of resocialization (see <A 
href="#Mo">Mol</A> 1976:50-54; 
142-201). Just as language is crucial for the social interpretation of reality 
and for the socialization of new members into that reality, so too antilanguage 
is crucial for the social reinterpretation of reality and for the 
resocialization of newcomers into that reality. John is an instance of such 
antilanguage in the Christian tradition.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.2.1. 
Resocialization</FONT><BR>
<DD>From the viewpoint of linguistics, the process of resocialization and 
solidarity maintenance makes special demands on the antilanguage. In particular, 
the antilanguage in question must facilitate the process of establishing 
strongly affective ties with both the reputational legitimate authority who is 
the central influence in the collectivity ("the disciple whom Jesus loved") as 
well as with significant others in the group (the "disciples"). And this process 
has to be geared to the individual group member, just as the original 
socialization process was. Now the linguistic genre most appropriate to this end 
is conversation and its implicit modes of reciprocity. In John again, there is 
ample evidence of distinctive conversations with Jesus that serve a 
resocialization function (John 3:1–4:42; 5:10ff; 6:22ff; 9:13–10:42; 11:1-44; 
11:45–12:36a; 13–17). How these conversations unfold is common knowledge. Jesus 
begins to converse with some individual person, moves on to address that person 
in monologue fashion, and the monologue turns into an address to the 
reader/hearer. Throughout these text-segments, there is heavy foregrounding of 
interpersonal meanings directed to individuals. It seems that these 
conversations are the feature of John that hold constant and perennial appeal 
for individualistically oriented persons. Jesus speaks to them in an individual 
way, not as group members as is the case in the rest of the Synoptics (or for 
the addressees of the remaining New Testament writings). It must be emphasized 
that it is John's characteristic antilanguage that accounts for this feature of 
the gospel. (In this regard, the use of the pronoun "you" singular in Greek is 
distinctive: 60 times in John, 10 times in Mark, 18 in Matt and 26 times in 
Luke; similarly the pronoun "you" plural in Greek: 68 times in John, 11 in Mark, 
30 in Matt, and 28 times in Luke—such emphatic use of the pronoun in Greek 
simply underscores the interpersonal dimension).<BR>
<DD>The alternative reality generated by groups such as John's has certain 
implications. First of all, it implies an emphasis on new core values and an 
attempt to create standards and situations to implement those values. It 
likewise implies a preoccupation with social boundaries, with social definition 
and defense of identity by means of repeated and varied articulation of the new 
reality now so clearly perceived. Of course both of these points are realized in 
John's strong contrast between the above, spirit, etc. and the below, flesh, 
etc. and the forms of experience proper to each. Further the counter-reality in 
question implies a special conception of information and knowledge—a feature 
more than amply highlighted in John (the word "to know" occurs more than 150 
times). Finally such counter-reality implies that social meanings will be seen 
as oppositions; values are defined in terms of what they are not. Again, in John 
it is quite clear that Jesus' signs are simply not about what is going on, i.e. 
healing or rescue, but about something more and something other than one can 
ostensibly witness. Perhaps the clearest articulation of this process is to be 
found in the narrative of the man born blind (John 9:1-41).<BR>
<DD>Further, as Halliday has observed, the overlexicalization of antilanguages 
is a form of variant in linguistics. In general, a variant is an alternative 
realization of a linguistic element on the next, or some higher level of 
abstraction in the linguistic system. A higher level realization always has the 
same meaning in some respect as the items falling beneath it. For example, the 
lexical items, "fruit," "vegetables," "meat," and "bread" have "food" as their 
variant. "Food" is an alternative realization of a linguistic element such as 
"bread" or "meat" on a higher level in the linguistic system. Similarly, this 
higher level realization, "food," always has the same meaning in some respect as 
the items falling beneath it, in this case, "fruit, vegetables, meat, bread." 
Thus "fruit" can mean "food," "vegetables" can mean "food," "meat" can mean 
"food," and "bread" can mean "food," while the lexical item "food" can be used 
to mean any of the foregoing; they are technically variants of the word, "food." 
Similarly, in John "spirit, the above, life, light, not of the/this world, 
freedom, truth, love" are all variants of the "new reality" which John 
identifies with and in Jesus of Nazareth. On the contrary, "the flesh, the 
below, death, darkness, this/the world, slavery, lie, hate" are all variants of 
what John and the collectivity addressed in the work oppose, the "old reality" 
of the society from which they came.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.2.2. Uniquely New 
Meanings</FONT><BR>
<DD>However the significant thing about the lexical items (words and sentences) 
distinctive of an antilanguage, as Halliday notes, is that many of them have no 
equivalent meanings at all in the standard language of the broader society. 
Sentences such as: "I and the Father (= God) are one" (John 10:30); "Truly, 
truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am (8:58); or the identification of 
Jesus of Nazareth with the pre-existing Word of God become flesh (1:1ff) would 
simply be meaningless in the language of the broader society. This does not mean 
that they could not be understood and judged to be meaningless, or that they 
could not be translated (after all, our English versions do them adequate 
justice). Rather, what it does mean is that such propositions do not function as 
meaning bearing language in the semantic system of regular language, even the 
regular "religious" language of contemporary early Christianity and the house of 
Israel. It is quite significant to note that there are no such sentences in the 
writings of Paul or the other gospels and non-Johannine New Testament 
documents.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.2.3. Metaphorical Meaning</FONT><BR>
<DD>The foregoing considerations point to the fact that an antilanguage is a 
metaphor for the regular language of society at large. Metaphorization takes 
place when some common, often implicit, quality proper to one entity is 
predicated of another, e.g., "My brother is a lion." Here the implicit property 
is strength or ferocity; thus the explicit sentence would read: "My brother is 
as strong as/as ferocious as a lion." In antilanguage, such a metaphorical 
quality appears all the way through the system. Halliday tells us that it is 
this metaphorical quality that defines an antilanguage. In John, this 
metaphorical quality can be seen in the "I am . . ." statements where Jesus says 
of himself: "I am bread, light, a door, life, way, vine," and the like. The 
metaphorical quality inherent in the list of 
ambiguity—misunderstanding—clarification sequences noted previously also point 
to the same thing. Metaphor constitutes the element of antilanguage that is 
present in all language to some extent. For much of everyday language is in fact 
metaphorical, e.g., horsepower in an automobile, a cell in biology, conceiving 
ideas. Yet the metaphorical quality of everyday language is lost and has come to 
be identified with regular speech, with reality itself. On the other hand, what 
distinguishes an antilanguage is that when it is compared with the existing 
language system of the culture in which it emerges and the society against which 
it stand, it is itself a metaphorical entity. Hence in antilanguage, 
metaphorical modes of expression are the norm. Metaphorical modes of expression 
are an antilanguage's regular pattern of realization.<BR>
<DD>As pointed out previously, the main form of discourse used in socialization 
and in reality maintenance is conversation. The reality generating and 
maintaining power of language lies in conversation. It is cumulative and depends 
for its effectiveness on continuous enforcement in social interaction. Now 
John's gospel is really the only New Testament writing presenting extended 
conversations. Furthermore, all the great Johannine metaphors emerge in 
conversations. Their metaphorical points are made in conversation, thus 
maintaining the resocialization quality of the work in the reader's/hearer's 
being addressed by Jesus in these conversations as the dialogue becomes 
monologue. In the resocialization process conversation relies heavily upon 
foregrounding and highlighting interpersonal meanings, and the great Johannine 
conversations surely do that. Finally, conversation depends for its power to 
generate reality on its being casual. In John, again, Jesus' many and frequent 
conversations so often point to casual encounters with individuals with whom the 
group member can empathize and thus take on the role of conversation partner as 
Jesus moves on to monologue in the second part of these conversations.<BR>
<DD>A final point Halliday makes is that within the ideational mode of meaning 
(what is being talked about), an antilanguage may adopt linguistic structures 
and lexical collocations that are self-consciously opposed to the norms of 
established language. This is typical of the more intellectual antilanguages. 
Now there is evidence of this feature in John, although many such items are 
"translated out" in English versions, e.g. in John the verb "to believe" most 
often has the preposition "into"; Jesus refers to his death as "being lifted 
up"; and for John seeing is believing throughout the story of Jesus' activity. 
Consequently, the modes of linguistic expression in antilanguage, when seen from 
the standpoint of the established language, appear diffuse, round about and 
metaphorical—and so they are from that angle.<BR>
<DD>But seen on their own terms, they appear direct and forceful, powerful 
manifestations of the linguistic system in the service of socialization into a 
new reality. It is the reality being experienced and newly interpreted that is 
oblique, since it can only be seen as a metaphorical transformation of the 
"true" reality of the greater society. But the function of an antilanguage text 
with respect to that reality is a reinforcing one, all the more direct because 
it is a reality which needs much reinforcement. It is the new reality, the new 
experience and perceptions, of their group.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3.3. Another 
Intermediate Summary</FONT><BR>
<DD>It should be clear by now that John's is, indeed, quite different from the 
other gospels and that John's group was quite different from other Christian 
associations in the first century Mediterranean. The foregoing considerations 
deriving from sociolinguistics point up precisely why this is the case. One can 
readily see the quality of the John's group. John writes for persons actually 
living in an alternate society embedded in a larger society, that of "this 
world" and of "Judeans." While we may presume that John's social situation does 
not determine his personal genius or the exact form that his work has taken, we 
can be reasonably certain that this social situation did determine and define 
the limits within which he was able to select features that would make sense to 
his audience as well as the general shape of the patterns of perception 
available to members of his group. The perceptions of the author of John and of 
the association to which he belonged were realized and articulated in language, 
and John's language is antilanguage.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4. Speech 
Accommodation, Antilanguage and Love</FONT><BR>
<DD>While many persons are motivated to read the gospels to "follow Christ" and 
discover a way of life, those who read John are bound to be disappointed. For 
aside from the ritual of foot-washing (standing for forgiveness and 
reconciliation, see <A 
href="#1993">Malina</A> 1993: 
75-81) and Jesus insistence that his disciples follow his commandments, only a 
single commandment is to be found in the whole gospel, the commandment to "love 
one another." What is curious about this gospel, then, is that it has little if 
any indication of what it takes to be a disciple except to be attached to Jesus 
and to the group. Thus the foot-washing ritual and the love command are the 
burden of John for the ingroup. There are really no other commandments.<BR>
<DD>Yet speech accommodation theory suggests that the successful author must 
converge with the audience. Within the framework of an antisociety, the thrust 
of antilanguage is to underscore the interpersonal and result in bonding among 
members. Jesus' repeated love command in John does the same and looks to 
identical outcomes. Such interpersonal solidarity and bonding requires a degree 
of intimacy (see <A 
href="#Kn">Knapp</A> 1983; 1984). 
"Intimacy . . . refers to variations in knowledge of and/or commitment to one's 
relationship partner" (<A 
href="#Kn">Knapp</A> 1983: 192). 
As a sort of appendix to our consideration of John's speech accommodation and 
antilanguage, I should like to present a typology of linguistic features that 
underscore group attachment in terms of intimacy. Knapp has developed a scale of 
the general dimensions of communication associated with relationship 
development. The scale moves in either direction from more to less intimacy and 
vice-versa. The dimensions he employs represent the content, diversity, quality, 
patterning and interpretation of messages and interactions (<A 
href="#Kn">Knapp</A> 1983; 1984: 
13-23). Knapp's General Dimensions of Communication Associated with Relationship 
Development<BR><BR><BR>

<DD>After briefly presenting each of these features, I offer a sampling of 
evidence from John to indicate how John's language moves toward greater intimacy 
throughout the work.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4.1. Narrow/Broad</FONT><BR>
<DD>This dimension refers to the variety and quality of messages communicated: a 
contracting or expanding number of messages as well as the refinement of ideas 
and feelings to communicate. John surely points to an expanding number of 
messages for group members.<BR>
<UL>* Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were 
  to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not 
  yet glorified (John 7:39).<BR>* But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the 
  Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your 
  remembrance all that I have said to you (John 14:26).<BR>* I have yet many 
  things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth 
  comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own 
  authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the 
  things that are to come (John 16:12- 13).<BR>* But there are also many other 
  things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that 
  the world itself could not contain the books that would be written (John 
  21:25).</UL>Presumably persons in John's group knew about these "many other 
things" and shared their information with group members.<BR><BR><FONT 
size=4>4.2. Stylized/Unique</FONT><BR>
<DD>First contact with others takes place in terms of stylized behavior widely 
employed and understood by others. As a person gets to know another better in 
terms of difference from others, greater intimacy is revealed by more 
personalized communication devices adapted to the peculiar nature of the 
interactants.<BR>
<DD>Intimates develop more specialized and unique communication patterns adapted 
to the particular characteristics of their personalities and relationship. 
Consider the opening conversations with those who would become intimates:<BR>
<UL>* He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "So you are 
  Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas" (which means Peter) (John 
  1:42).</UL>Jesus gives Simon a nickname right from the outset. Ingroup nicknames 
are indication of unique relations.<BR>
<UL>* Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, "Behold, an 
  Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" Nathanael said to him, "How do you 
  know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under 
  the fig tree, I saw you." Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of 
  God! You are the King of Israel!" (John 1:47-49).</UL>Again, notice the lavish 
title, right from the outset, again, pointing to unique relations.<BR>
<DD>Further indications in the direction of uniqueness: Jesus' knowledge of the 
Samaritan woman's singular situation of having five husbands and her recognizing 
him as "prophet" (John 4:17-19); Mary, sister of Lazarus, anointing Jesus (John 
11:2); Jesus' socially incredible washing of his disciple's feet (John 
13:5).<BR>
<DD>However less intimacy is indicated by return to stylized expressions. Judas' 
kiss (Mark 14:45; Matt 26:49; Luke 22:47-48) was a stylized greeting of a 
friend. Mention of this kiss is lacking in John (but not Judas' traitorous 
presence: John 18:2-3), perhaps alluding to previous intimate 
relationship.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4.3. Difficult/Efficient</FONT><BR>
<DD>As intimacy increases, there is a gradual increase in accuracy and 
efficiency of communication. This is a dimension of supplying context. Greater 
intimacy points to high context communication in which relatively little has to 
be spelled out. The whole of John's gospel, directed at the ingroup as it is, is 
an instance of extremely high context communication.<BR>
<UL>* I tell you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place 
  you may believe that I am he (John 13:19).<BR>* Jesus knew that they wanted to 
  ask him; so he said to them, "Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I 
  meant by saying, 'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little 
  while, and you will see me'? (John 16:19)<BR>* Then he said to Thomas, "Put 
  your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my 
  side; do not be faithless, but believing (John 20:27).</UL>
<DD>On the other hand, no intimacy points to extremely low context. The 
ignorance of outgroup persons indicates misunderstanding and non-understanding, 
hence low context situations, requiring much explanation and clarification:<BR>
<UL>* When they heard these words, some of the people said, "This is really 
  the prophet." Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Is the Christ 
  to come from Galilee? Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended 
  from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?" So there 
  was a division among the people over him (John 7:40-43).</UL>On the other hand, 
high context may lead to overconfidence that leads to periods of 
difficulty—periods when old assumptions are no longer valid (hence 
misunderstanding and non-understanding).<BR>
<UL>* Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a 
  woman, but none said, "What do you wish?" or, "Why are you talking with her?" 
  (John 4: 27).<BR>* Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let 
  us also go, that we may die with him" (John 11:16).</UL><BR><FONT size=4>4.4. 
Rigid/Flexible</FONT><BR>
<DD>As persons know each other, they are able to communicate the same idea or 
feeling in several different ways. This is what flexibility points to. Yet it is 
possible that only some messages are subjected to message flexibility, while 
others are not. On the other hand, new acquaintances and persons terminating 
relationships have fewer channels of communication and maintain more consistent 
ways of communicating any given message.<BR>
<DD>Previously, I noted that the synonyms for the activities of discipleship and 
being related to Jesus ("to believe, come, abide, follow, love, keep words, 
receive, have, see") and the terms for the two contrasting realms ("the above, 
spirit," etc., and "the below, flesh," etc.) point in the direction of the 
antilanguage, interpersonal component of language. Yet it is equally true that 
this whole vocabulary fits this flexibility pattern that moves in the direction 
of intimacy.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4.5. Awkward/Smooth</FONT><BR>
<DD>Intimates have an inclination toward fusion—psychologically and 
behaviorally. They understand what the other is up to; they can anticipate moves 
and choices. They often accommodate their language styles to those of others in 
order to enhance perceptions of similarity and to increase attraction. The 
metaphor of Jesus the vine points to social fusion in John's association (John 
15:1-7). One cannot get closer than: "Abide in me, and I in you" (15:4). 
Disciples will even find the words for such smooth speech:<BR>
<UL>* For I have given them [disciples] the words which you [God] gave me, and 
  they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have 
  believed that you did send me (John 17:8).</UL>
<DD>New acquaintances display less interpersonal meshing or synchrony; they are 
more awkward and less synchronized. Yet some people show a high degree of 
smoothness on certain limited topics (e.g., salesmen, TV preachers, con 
men).<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4.6. Public/Personal</FONT><BR>
<DD>We first reveal our public selves to others. As intimacy increases, we 
gradually reveal more and more of our personal and private selves to our 
relationship partners. Revelation of personal thoughts, feelings, and beliefs 
provide personal information. Such access to the personal sphere is replicated 
in (1) increased proximity, (2) more bodily touching in general, (3) touching 
certain body parts inaccessible to others, (4) looking into the eyes of another 
for extended periods (5) looking at another's body or specific body parts, (6) 
relaxation of any body tension suggesting a "guarded" approach, etc. Verbalized 
feedback increases as intimacy increases.<BR>
<DD>In John this movement from public to private comes through in the very 
structure of the work. From John 1:19 to 12:50 we are amid the outgroup, as 
disciples observe greater and lesser degrees of closeness with Jesus; but from 
13:1 to 17:26 we are in the exclusive presence of the ingroup and privacy. John 
reports a well wrought piece of personal revelation simply not meant for the 
public. That the disciples are moving in this direction even in the first part 
of the story is indicated by Peter: "Simon Peter answered him, 'Lord, to whom 
shall we go? You have the words of eternal life'" (John 6:68).<BR>
<DD>With the collapse of intimacy, behaviors representing public selves 
increase.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4.7. Hesitant/Spontaneous</FONT><BR>
<DD>Intimacy brings an increase in spontaneity, a lack of observable planning. 
Knapp notes that the explicitness of a person's hesitancy or spontaneity may 
vary, but nonverbal indications in gesture such as the style and speed of 
gestures and their quality underscore the spontaneity of the direction of 
intimacy or its opposite. Communication with new acquaintances and former 
intimates (less predictable others) is likely to be cautious and hesitant.<BR>
<DD>Thus in John, we find spontaneity, hence intimacy, indicated by the 
following:<BR>
<UL>* One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying close to the breast of 
  Jesus; so Simon Peter beckoned to him and said, "Tell us who it is of whom he 
  speaks." So lying thus, close to the breast of Jesus, he said to him, "Lord, 
  who is it?" Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I 
  have dipped it." So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the 
  son of Simon Iscariot (John 13:23-26).</UL>Perhaps the same is indicated by the 
behavior of Mary, sister of Lazarus (John 11:2) and of Thomas who acts like a 
former intimate restored to intimacy by Jesus' invitation: "Put your finger 
here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side" (John 
20:27).<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4.8. Overt Evaluation Suspended/Given</FONT><BR>
<DD>With intimates, we begin sharing our previously covert evaluations first in 
general and positive dimensions, and subsequently with both positive and 
negative feedback. Further, evaluations move beyond stereotypical cues and are 
articulated to intimates with highly significant evaluative signals. The longer 
intimates are with each other, the more they have at stake. Evaluations are 
avoided in emotionally sensitive areas.<BR>
<UL>* Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not 
  know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, 
  'Show us the Father'? (John 14:9).</UL>
<DD>All the dimensions of intimacy generally stabilize within a range that is 
below the peak achieved or achievable. Yet even in more intimate relationships, 
the discussion of certain topics or on certain occasions may take on the 
qualities of non-intimate relationships. Significantly in John's story, Jesus 
presumably broaches an off-limits topic when he really never tells his disciples 
where he is ultimately going:<BR>
<UL>* "A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and 
  you will see me." Some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this 
  that he says to us, 'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a 
  little while, and you will see me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?" They 
  said, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We do not know what he means." 
  Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them, "Is this what you 
  are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, 'A little while, and you will 
  not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'? Truly, truly, I 
  say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be 
  sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy" (John 16:16-20).</UL>Even worse, 
he tells them they cannot come anyway:<BR>
<UL>* Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and 
  as I said to the Judeans so now I say to you, "Where I am going you cannot 
  come" (John 13:13).</UL><BR><FONT size=4>5. Conclusion</FONT><BR>
<DD>In sum, the whole of John abounds in statements, scenes and behavioral 
descriptions that are redolent of "love," that is of group attachment, of the 
interpersonal dimension of language, in sum of intimacy. The story of Jesus 
moves in the direction of greater intimacy between Jesus and his own. In fact, 
in the end, the focal personage in the story with whom the audience would 
identify is the disciple whom Jesus loved, the beloved disciple (13:23; 
18:15-16; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7,20).<BR>
<DD>While speech accommodation theory and the sociolinguistic mode of analysis 
are simply first steps to understanding the Johannine group by means of the text 
of John, they are important first steps. For they furnish insight into and an 
explanation for the distinctive Johannine ways of describing God and human 
relations with God. This insight and explanation, of course, are rooted in the 
social behavior of John's association, behavior used as analogy to explain the 
God revealed in Jesus. Further, this mode of analysis enables the interpreter to 
come to know and appreciate the personages who embodied faith in Jesus in first 
century, Mediterranean contexts typical of alternate societies—their willingness 
to identify Jesus as access to the divinity of Israelite tradition, their 
self-distancing from their original mooring in temple-based Israelite Yahwism, 
and their emphatic stance relative to interpersonal commitment within their 
group.<BR>
<DD>And it helps the modern student to discover the sort of persons to be found 
in that difficult yet exhilarating social situation, persons who made sense of 
the overarching meaning of human existence "in Jesus" in highly creative and 
significant ways. Finally, such analysis highlights the ever present problem of 
individuals and their groups who lived in alternate societies. Alternate 
societies are impermanent arrangements within a broader society. Persons who 
form alternate societies must eventually face the need to return to stable 
society and an articulation of Christianity befitting such stable society. 
Perhaps the Johannine letters likewise intimate this movement, with the 
beginnings of the dissolution of John's antisocietal group.<BR><BR>
