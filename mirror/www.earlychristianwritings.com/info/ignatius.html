INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE 
EPISTLE OF IGNATIUS TO THE EPHESIANS.

<P>[a.d. 30-107.] The seductive myth which represents this Father as the little 
child whom the Lord placed in the midst of his apostles (Matthew 18: 2) 
indicates at least the period when he may be supposed to have been born. That he 
and Polycarp were fellow-disciples under St. John, is a tradition by no means 
inconsistent with anything in the Epistles of either. His subsequent history is 
sufficiently indicated in the Epistles which follow.</P>
<P>Had not the plan of this series been so exclusively that of a mere revised 
reprint, the writings of Ignatius themselves would have made me diffident as to 
the undertaking. It seems impossible for any one to write upon the subject of 
these precious remains, without provoking controversy. This publication is 
designed as an <I>Eirenicon</I>, and hence "few words are best," from one who 
might be supposed incapable of an unbiased opinion on most of the points which 
have been raised in connection with these Epistles. I must content myself 
therefore, by referring the studious reader to the originals as edited by Bishop 
Jacobson, with a Latin version and copious annotations. That revered and reamed 
divine honoured me with his friendship; and his precious edition has been my 
frequent study, with theological students, almost ever since it appeared in 
1840. It is by no means superannuated by the vigorous Ignatian literature which 
has since sprung up, and to which reference will he made elsewhere. But I am 
content to leave the whole matter, without comment, to the minds of Christians 
of whatever school and to their independent conclusions. It is a great thing to 
present them in a single volume with the shorter and longer Epistles duly 
compared, and with the Curetonian version besides. One luxury only I may claim, 
to relieve the drudging task-work of a mere reviser. Surely I may point out some 
of the proverbial wisdom of this great disciple, which has often stirred my 
soul, as with the trumpet heard by St. John in Patmos. In him, indeed, the lions 
encountered a lion, one truly begotten of "the Lion of the tribe of Judah." 
Take, then, as a specimen, these thrilling injunctions from his letter to 
Polycarp, to whom he bequeathed his own spirit, and in whom he well knew the 
Church would recognize a sort of survival of St. John himself If the reader has 
any true perception of the rhythm and force of the Greek language, let him learn 
by heart the originals of the following aphorisms:-</P>
<UL>
  <P>1. Find time to pray without ceasing.</P>
  <P>2. Every wound is not healed with the same remedy. </P>
  <P>3. The times demand thee, as pilots the haven.</P>
  <P>4. The crown is immortality.<SUP><A 
  href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/footnote/fn10.htm#P1062_193900">1</A></SUP> 
  </P>
  <P>5. Stand like a beaten anvil.<SUP><A 
  href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/footnote/fn10.htm#P1064_193986">2</A></SUP> 
  </P>
  <P>6. It is the part of a good athlete to be bruised and to prevail. </P>
  <P>7. Consider the times: look for Him who is above time. </P>
  <P>8. Slight not the menservants and the handmaids. </P>
  <P>9. Let your stewardship define your work.</P></UL>
<P>10. A Christian is not his own master, but waits upon God.</P>
<P>Ignatius so delighted in his name Theophorus (sufficiently expounded in his 
own words to Trajan or his official representative), that it is worth noting how 
deeply the early Christians felt and believed in (2 Corinthians 6: 16) the 
indwelling Spirit.</P>
<P>Ignatius has been censured for his language to the Romans, in which he seems 
to crave martyrdom. But he was already condemned, in law a dead man, and felt 
himself at liberty to glory in his tribulations. Is it more than modern 
Christians often too lightly sing?-</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <P>"Let cares like a wild deluge come,</P>
    <P>And storms of sorrow fall," etc.</P></UL></UL>
<P>So the holy martyr adds, "Only let me attain unto Jesus Christ."</P>
<P>The Epistle to the Romans is utterly inconsistent with any conception on his 
part, that Rome was the see and residence of a bishop holding any other than 
fraternal relations with himself. It is very noteworthy that it is devoid of 
expressions, elsewhere made emphatic, which would have been much insisted upon had they been found herein. Think what 
use would have been made of it, had the words which he addresses to the 
Smyrnaeans (chap. viii.) to strengthen their fidelity to Polycarp, been found in 
this letter to the Romans, especially as in this letter we first find the use of 
the phrase "Catholic Church" in patristic writings. He defines it as to be found 
"where Jesus Christ is," words which certainly do not limit it to communion with 
a professed successor of St. Peter.</P>
<P>The following is the original Introductory Notice:-</P>
<P>The epistles ascribed to Ignatius have given rise to more controversy than 
any other documents connected with the primitive Church. As is evident to every 
reader on the very first glance at these writings, they contain numerous 
statements which bear on points of ecclesiastical order that have long divided 
the Christian world; and a strong temptation has thus been felt to allow some 
amount of prepossession to enter into the discussion of their authenticity or 
spuriousness. At the same time, this question has furnished a noble field for 
the display of learning and acuteness, and has, in the various forms under which 
it has been debated, given rise to not a few works of the very highest ability 
and scholarship. We shall present such an outline of the controversy as may 
enable the reader to understand its position at the present day.</P>
<P>There are, in all, fifteen Epistles which bear the name of Ignatius. These 
are the following: One to the Virgin Mary, two to the Apostle John, one to Mary 
of Cassobelae, one to the Tarsians, one to the Antiochians, one to Hero, a 
deacon of Antioch, one to the Philippians; one to the Ephesians, one to the 
Magnesians, one to the Trallians, one to the Romans, one to the Philadelphians, 
one to the Smyrnaeans, and one to Polycarp. The first three exist only in Latin: 
all the rest are extant also in Greek.</P>
<P>It is now the universal opinion of critics, that the first eight of these 
professedly Ignatian letters are spurious. They bear in themselves indubitable 
proofs of being the production of a later age than that in which Ignatius lived. 
Neither Eusebius nor Jerome makes the least reference to them; and they are now 
by common consent set aside as forgeries, which were at various dates, and to 
serve special purposes, put forth under the name of the celebrated Bishop of 
Antioch.</P>
<P>But after the question has been thus simplified, it still remains 
sufficiently complex. Of the seven Epistles which are acknowledged by Eusebius 
(Hist. Eccl., iii. 36), we possess two Greek recensions, a shorter and a longer. 
It is plain that one or other of these exhibits a corrupt text, and scholars 
have for the most part agreed to accept the shorter form as representing the 
genuine letters of Ignatius. This was the opinion generally acquiesced in, from 
the time when critical editions of these Epistles began to be issued, down to 
our own day. Criticism, indeed, fluctuated a good deal as to which Epistles 
should be accepted and which rejected. Archp. Usher (1644), Isaac Vossius 
(1646), J. B. Cotelerius (1672), Dr. T. Smith (I709), and others, edited the 
writings ascribed to Ignatius in forms differing very considerably as to the 
order in which they were arranged, and the degree of authority assigned them, 
until at length, from about the beginning of the eighteenth century, the seven 
Greek Epistles, of which a translation is here given, came to be generally 
accepted in their <I>shorter</I> form as the genuine writings of Ignatius.</P>
<P>Before this date, however, there had not been wanting some who refused to 
acknowledge the authenticity of these Epistles in either of the recensions in 
which they were then known to exist. By far the most learned and elaborate work 
maintaining this position was that of Daillé (or Dallaeus), published in 1666. 
This drew forth in reply the celebrated <I>Vindiciae</I> of Bishop Pearson, 
which appeared in 1672. It was generally supposed that this latter work had 
established on an immoveable foundation the genuineness of the shorter form of 
the Ignatian Epistles; and, as we have stated above, this was the conclusion 
almost universally accepted down to our own day. The only considerable exception 
to this concurrence was presented by Whiston, who laboured to maintain in his 
<I>Primitive Christianity Revived </I>(1711) the superior claims of the longer 
recension of the Epistles, apparently influenced in doing so by the support 
which he thought they furnished to the kind of Arianism which he had 
adopted.</P>
<P>But although the shorter form of the Ignatian letters had been generally 
accepted in preference to the longer, there was still a pretty prevalent opinion 
among scholars, that even it could not be regarded as absolutely free from 
interpolations, or as of undoubted authenticity. Thus said Lardner, in his 
<I>Credibility of the Gospel History</I> (1743): "have carefully compared the 
two editions, and am very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger 
are an interpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or 
abridgment of the larger.... But whether the smaller themselves are the genuine 
writings of Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, is a question that has been much 
disputed, and has employed the pens of the ablest critics. And whatever 
positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own I have found it a 
very difficult question."</P>
<P>This expression of uncertainty was repeated in substance by Jortin (1751), 
Mosheim (1755), Griesbach (1768), Rosenmüller (1795), Neander (1826), and many 
others; some going so far as to deny that we have any authentic remains of 
Ignatius at all, while others, though admitting the seven shorter letters as 
being probably his, yet strongly suspected that they were not free from 
interpolation. Upon the whole, however, the shorter recension was, until 
recently, accepted without much opposition, and chiefly in dependence on the 
work of Bishop Pearson above mentioned, as exhibiting the genuine form of the 
Epistles of Ignatius.</P>
<P>But a totally different aspect was given to the question by the discovery of 
a Syriac version of three of these Epistles among the mss. procured from the 
monastery of St. Mary Deipara, in the desert of Nitria, in Egypt. In the years 
1838, 1839, and again in 1842, Archdeacon Tattam visited that monastery, and 
succeeded in obtaining for the English Government a vast number of ancient 
Syriac manuscripts. On these being deposited in the British Museum, the late Dr. 
Cureton, who then had charge of the Syriac department, discovered among them, 
first, the Epistle to Polycarp, and then again, the same Epistle, with those to 
the Ephesians and to the Romans, in two other volumes of manuscripts.</P>
<P>As the result of this discovery, Cureton published in 1845 a work, entitled, 
<I>The Ancient Syriac Version of the Epistles of St. Ignatius to Polycarp, the 
Ephesian, and the Romans</I>, etc., in which he argued that these Epistles 
represented more accurately than any formerly published what Ignatius had 
actually written. This, of course, opened up the controversy afresh. While some 
accepted the views of Cureton. others very strenuously opposed them. Among the 
former was the late Chev. Bunsen; among the latter, an anonymous writer in the 
<I>English Review</I>, and Dr. Hefele, in his third edition of the <I>Apostolic 
Fathers</I>. In reply to those who had controverted his arguments, Cureton 
published his <I>Vindiciae Ignatianae</I> in 1846, and his <I>Corpus 
Ignatianum</I> in 1849. He begins his introduction to the last-named work with 
the following sentences: "Exactly three centuries and a half intervened between 
the time when three Epistles in Latin, attributed to St. Ignatius, first issued 
from the press, and the publication in 1845 of three letters in Syriac bearing 
the name of the same apostolic writer. Very few years passed before the former 
were almost universally regarded as false and spurious; and it seems not 
improbable that scarcely a longer period will elapse before the latter be almost 
as generally acknowledged and received as the only true and genuine letters of 
the venerable Bishop of Antioch that have either come down to our times, or were 
ever known in the earliest ages of the Christian Church."</P>
<P>Had the somewhat sanguine hope thus expressed been realized, it would have 
been unnecessary for us to present to the English reader more than a translation 
of these three Syriac Epistles. But the Ignatian controversy is not yet settled. 
There are still those who hold that the balance of argument is in favour of the 
shorter Greek, as against these Syriac Epistles. They regard the latter as an 
epitome of the former, and think the harshness which, according to them, exists 
in the sequence of thoughts and sentences, clearly shows that this is the case. 
We have therefore given all the forms of the Ignatian letters which have the 
least claim on our attention. The reader may judge, by comparison for himself, which of these is to be 
accepted as genuine, supposing him disposed to admit the claims of any one of 
them. We content ourselves with laying the materials for judgment before him, 
and with referring to the above-named works in which we find the whole subject 
discussed.As to the personal history of Ignatius, almost nothing is known. The 
principal source of information regarding him is found in the account of his 
martyrdom, to which the reader is referred. Polycarp alludes to him in his 
Epistle to the Philippians (chap. ix.), and also to his letters (chap. xiii.). 
Irenaeus quotes a passage from his Epistle to the Romans (Adv. Haer., v.28; 
<I>Epist. ad Rom.</I>, chap. iv.), without, however, naming him. Origen twice 
refers to him, first in the preface to his Comm. on the Song of Solomon, where 
he quotes a passage from the Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, and again in his 
sixth homily on St. Luke, where he quotes from the Epistle to the Ephesians, 
both times naming the author. It is unnecessary to give later references.</P>
<P>Supposing the letters of Ignatius and the account of his martyrdom to be 
authentic, we learn from them that he voluntarily presented himself before 
Trajan at Antioch, the seat of his bishopric, when that prince was on his 
<I>first </I>expedition against the Parthians and Armenians (a.d. 107); and on 
professing himself a Christian, was condemned to the wild beasts. After a long 
and dangerous voyage he came to Smyrna, of which Polycarp was bishop, and thence 
wrote his four Epistles to the Ephesians, the Magnesians, the Trallians, and the 
Romans. From Smyrna he came to Troas, and tarrying there a few days, he wrote to 
the Philadelphians, the Smyrnaeans, and Polycarp. He then came on to Neapolis, 
and passed through the whole of Macedonia. Finding a ship at Dyrrachium in 
Epirus about to sail into Italy, he embarked, and crossing the Adriatic, was 
brought to Rome, where he perished on the 20th of December 107, or, as some 
think, who deny a twofold expedition of Trajan against the Parthians, on the 
same day of the year a.d. 116. </P>
