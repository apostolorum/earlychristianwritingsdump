Introductory 
Note.

<P>[a.d. 145-220.] When our Lord repulsed the woman of Canaan (Matt. xv. 22) 
with apparent harshness, he applied to her people the epithet dogs, with which 
the children of Israel had thought it piety to reproach them. When He accepted 
her faith and caused it to be recorded for our learning, He did something more: 
He reversed the curse of the Canaanite and showed that the Church was designed 
"for all people;" Catholic alike for all time and for all sorts and conditions 
of men.</P>
<P>Thus the North-African Church was loved before it was born: the Good Shepherd 
was gently leading those "that were with young." Here was the charter of those 
Christians to be a Church, who then were Canaanites in the land of their father 
Ham. It is remarkable indeed that among these pilgrims and strangers to the West 
the first elements of Latin Christianity come into view. Even at the close of 
the Second Century the Church in Rome is an inconsiderable, though prominent, 
member of the great confederation of Christian Churches which has its chief 
seats in Alexandria and Antioch, and of which the entire Literature is Greek. It 
is an African presbyter who takes from Latin Christendom the reproach of 
theological and literary barrenness and begins the great work in which, upon his 
foundations, Cyprian and Augustine built up, with incomparable genius, that 
Carthaginian School of Christian thought by which Latin Theology was dominated 
for centuries. It is important to note (1.) that providentially not one of these 
illustrious doctors died in Communion with the Roman See, pure though it was and 
venerable at that time; and (2.) that to the works of Augustine the Reformation 
in Germany and Continental Europe was largely due; while (3.) the 
<I>specialties</I> of the Anglican Reformation were, in like proportion, due to 
the writings of Tertullian and Cyprian. The hinges of great and controlling 
destinies for Western Europe and our own America are to be found in the period 
we are now approaching.</P>
<P>The merest school-boy knows much of the history of Carthage, and how the 
North Africans became Roman citizens. How they became Christians is not so 
clear. A melancholy destiny has enveloped Carthage from the outset, and its 
glory and greatness as a Christian See were transient indeed. It blazed out all 
at once in Tertullian, after about a century of missionary labours had been 
exerted upon its creation: and having given a Minucius Felix, an Arnobius and a 
Lactantius to adorn the earliest period of Western Ecclesiastical learning, in 
addition to its nobler luminaries, it rapidly declined. At the beginning of the 
Third Century, at a council presided over by Agrippinus, Bishop of Carthage, 
there were present not less than seventy bishops of the Province. A period of 
cruel persecutions followed, and the African Church received a baptism of 
blood.</P>
<P>Tertullian was born a heathen, and seems to have been educated at Rome, where 
he probably practiced as a jurisconsult. We may, perhaps, adopt most of the 
ideas of Allix, as conjecturally probable, and assign his birth to a.d. 145. He 
became a Christian about185, and a presbyter about 190. The period of his strict 
orthodoxy very nearly expires with the century. He lived to an extreme old age, 
and some suppose even till a.d. 240. More probably we must adopt the date 
preferred by recent writers, a.d. 220.</P>
<P>It seems to be the fashion to treat of Tertullian as a Montanist, and only 
incidentally to celebrate his services to the Catholic Orthodoxy of Western 
Christendom. Were I his biographer I should reverse this course, as a mere act 
of justice, to say nothing of gratitude to a man of splendid intellect, to whom 
the filial spirit of Cyprian accorded the loving tribute of a disciple, and 
whose genius stamped itself upon the very words of Latin theology, and prepared 
the language for the labours of a Jerome. In creating the Vulgate, and so 
lifting the Western Churches into a position of intellectual equality with the 
East, the latter as well as St. Augustine himself were debtors to Tertullian in 
a degree not to be estimated by any other than the Providential Mind that 
inspired his brilliant career as a Christian.</P>
<P>In speaking of Tatian I laid the base for what I wished to say of Tertullian. 
Let God only be their judge; let us gratefully recognize the debt we owe to 
them. Let us read them, as we read the works of King Solomon. We must, indeed, 
approve of the discipline of the Primitive Age, which allowed of no compromises. 
The Church was struggling for existence, and could not permit any man to become 
her master. The more brilliant the intellect, the more dangerous to the poor 
Church were its perversions of her Testimony. Before the heathen tribunals, and 
in the market-places, it would not answer to let Christianity appear 
double-tongued. The orthodoxy of the Church, not less than her children, was 
undergoing an ordeal of fire. It seems a miracle that her Testimony preserved 
its unity, and that heresy was branded as such by the instinct of the Faithful. 
Poor Tertullian was cut off by his own act. The weeping Church might bewail him 
as David mourned for Absalom, but like David, she could not give the Ark of God 
into other hands than those of the loyal and the true. I have set the writings 
of Tertullian in a natural and logical order,' so as to aid the student, and to 
relieve him from the distractions of such an arrangement as one finds in 
Oehler's edition. Valuable as it is, the practical use of it is irritating and 
confusing. The reader of that edition may turn to the slightly differing schemes 
of Neander and Kaye, for a theoretical order of the works; but here he will find 
a classification which will aid his inquiries. He will find, first, those works 
which connect with the Apologists of the former volumes of this series: which 
illustrate the Church's position toward the outside world, the Jews as well as 
the Gentiles. Next come those works which contend with internal differences and 
heresies. And then, those which reflect the morals and manners of Christians. 
These are classed with some reference to their degrees of freedom from the 
Montanistic taint, and are followed, last of all, by the few tracts which belong 
to the melancholy period of his lapse, and are directed against the Church's 
orthodoxy.</P>
<P>Let it be borne in mind, that if this sad close of Tertullian's career cannot 
be extenuated, the later history of Latin Christianity forbids us to condemn 
him, in the tones which proceeded from the Virgin Church with authority, and 
which the law of her testimony and the instinct of self-preservation forced her 
to utter. Let us reflect that St. Bernard and after him the Schoolmen, whom we 
so deservedly honour, separated themselves far more absolutely than ever 
Tertullian did from the orthodoxy of Primitive Christendom. The schism which 
withdrew the West from Communion with the original seats of Christendom, and 
from Nicene Catholicity, was formidable beyond all expression, in comparison 
with Tertullian's entanglements with a delusion which the See of Rome itself had 
momentarily patronized. Since the Council of Trent, not a theologian of the 
Latins has been free from organic heresies, compared with which the fanaticism 
of our author was a trifling aberration. Since the late Council of the Vatican, 
essential Montanism has become organized in the Latin Churches: for what are the 
new revelations and oracles of the pontiff but the deliria of another claimant 
to the voice and inspiration of the Paraclete ? Poor Tertullian ! The sad 
influences of his decline and folly have been fatally felt in all the subsequent 
history of the West, but, surely subscribers to the Modern Creed of the Vatican 
have reason to "speak gently of <I>their father's fall</I>" To Dollinger, with 
the "Old Catholic" remnant only, is left the right to name the Montanists 
heretics, or to upbraid Tertullian as a lapser from Catholicity.</P>
<P>From Dr. Holmes, I append the following Introductory Notice: </P>
<P>(I.) Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus, as our author is called in the 
mss. of his works, is thus noticed by Jerome in his <I>Catalogus Scriptorus 
Ecclesiasticorum</I> : "Tertullian, a presbyter, the first Latin writer after Victor and Apollonius, 
was a native of the province of Africa and city of Carthage, the son of a 
proconsular centurion: he was a man of a sharp and vehement temper, flourished 
under Severus and Antoninus Caracalla, and wrote numerous works, which (as they 
are generally known) I think it unnecessary to particularize. I saw at 
Concordia, in Italy, an old man named Paulus. He said that when young he had met 
at Rome with an aged amanuensis of the blessed Cyprian, who told him that 
Cyprian never passed a day without reading some portion of Tertullian's works, 
and used frequently to say, <I>Give me any master</I>, meaning Tertullian. After 
remaining a presbyter of the church until he had attained the middle age of 
life, Tertullian was, by the envy and contumelious treatment of the Roman 
clergy, driven to embrace the opinions of Montanus, which he has mentioned in 
several of his works under the title of the New Prophecy.... He is reported to 
have lived to a very advanced age, and to have composed many other works which 
are not extant." We add Bishop Kaye's notes on this extract, in an abridged 
shape: "The correctness of some parts of this account has been questioned. 
Doubts have been entertained whether Tertullian was a presbyter, although these 
have solely arisen from Roman Catholic objections to a married priesthood; for 
it is certain that he was married, there being among his works two treatises 
addressed to his wife.... Another question has been raised respecting the place 
where Tertullian officiated as a presbyter-whether at Carthage or at Rome. That 
he at one time resided at Carthage may be inferred from Jerome's statement, and 
is rendered certain by several passages of his own writings. Allix supposes that 
the notion of his having been a presbyter of the Roman Church owed its rise to 
what Jerome said of the envy and abuse of the Roman clergy impelling him to 
espouse the party of Montanus. Optatus, and the author of the work <I>de Haeresibus</I>, which Sirmond edited under tile 
title of Praedestinatus, expressly call him a Carthaginian presbyter. Semler, 
however, in a dissertation inserted in his edition of Tertullian's works, contends that he was a presbyter of the Roman Church. Eusebius tells us that he was accurately acquainted with the Roman laws, and on other 
accounts a distinguished person at Rome. Tertullian displays, moreover, a knowledge of the proceedings of the Roman 
Church with respect to Marcion and Valentinus, who were once members of it, 
which could scarcely have been obtained by one who had not himself been numbered 
amongst its presbyters. Semler admits that, after Tertullian seceded from the church, he left and 
returned to Carthage. Jerome does not inform us whether Tertullian was born of 
Christian parents, or was converted to Christianity. There are passages in his 
writings which seem to imply that he had been a Gentile; yet he may perhaps mean to 
describe, not his own condition, but that of Gentiles in general, before their 
conversion. Allix and the majority of commentators understand them literally, as 
well as some other passages in which he speaks of his own infirmities and 
sinfulness. His writings show that he flourished at the period specified by 
Jerome-that is, during the reigns of Severus and Antoninus Caracalla, or between 
the years a.d. 193 and 216; but they supply no precise information respecting 
the date of his birth, or any of the principal occurrences of his life. Allix 
places his birth about 145 or 150; his conversion to Christianity about a.d. 
185; his marriage about 186; his admission to the priesthood about 192; his adoption of the opinions of Montanus about 199; and his death 
about a.d. 220. But these dates, it must be understood, rest entirely on 
conjecture." </P>
<P>(II.) Tertullian's work against Marcion, as it happens, is, <I>as to its 
date</I>, the best authenticated-perhaps the only well authenticated-particular 
connected with the author's life. He himself s mentions the fifteenth year of 
the reign of Severus as the time when he was writing the work: "Ad xv. jam 
Severi imperatoris." This agrees with Jerome's Chronicle, where occurs this 
note: "Anno 2223 Severi xvº Tertullianus ... celebrator." This year is assigned to the year of our Lord 207 but notwithstanding the certainty of this date, it is far from clear that it 
describes more than the time of the publication of the First look. On the 
contrary, it is nearly certain that the other books, although connected 
manifestly enough in the author's argument and purpose (compare the initial and 
the final chapters of the several books), were yet issued at separate times. 
Noesselt shows that between the Book i. and Books ii.-iv. Tertullian issued his <I>De 
Praescript. Haeret.</I>, and previous to Book v. he published his tracts, <I>De 
Carne Christi</I> and <I>De Resurrectione Carnis</I>. After giving the 
incontestable date of the xv. of Severus for the first book, he says it is a 
mistake to suppose that the other books were published with it. He adds: 
"Although we cannot undertake to determine whether Tertullian issued his Books 
ii., iii., iv., against Marcion, together or separately, or in what year, we yet 
venture to affirm that Book v. appeared apart from the rest. For the tract <I>De 
Resurr. Carnis</I> appears from its second chapter to have been published after 
the tract <I>De Carne Christi</I>, in which latter work (chap. vii.) he quotes a 
passage from the fourth book against Marcion. But in his Book v. against Marcion 
(chap. x.), he refers to his work <I>De Resurr. Carnis</I>; which circumstance 
makes it evident that Tertullian published his Book v. at a different time from 
his Book iv. In his Book i. he announces his intention (chap. i.) of some time 
or other completing his tract <I>De Praescript. Haeret</I>., but in his book 
[<I>De Carne Christi</I> (chap. ii.), he mentions how he had completed it,-a 
conclusive proof that his Book i. against Marcion preceded the other books."</P>
<P>(III.) Respecting Marcion himself, the most formidable heretic who had as yet 
opposed revealed truth, enough will turn up in this treatise, with the notes 
which we have added in explanation, to satisfy the reader. It will, however, be 
convenient to give here a few introductory particulars of him. Tertullian mentions Marcion as being, with Valentinus, in communion with the Church at 
Rome, "under the episcopate of the blessed Eleutherus." He goes on to charge 
them with "ever-restless curiosity, with which they infected even the brethren;" 
and informs us that they were more than once put out of communion-"Marcion, 
indeed, with the 200 sesterces which he brought into the church." He goes on to say, that "being at last condemned to the banishment of a 
perpetual separation, they sowed abroad the poisons of their doctrines. 
Afterwards, when Marcion, having professed penitence, agreed to the terms 
offered to him, that he should receive reconciliation on condition that he 
brought back to the church the rest also, whom he had trained up for perdition, 
he was prevented by death." He was a native of Sinope in Pontus, of which city, 
according to an account preserved by Epiphanius, which, however, is somewhat doubtful, his father was bishop, and of high 
character both for his orthodoxy and exemplary practice. He came to Rome soon 
after the death of Hyginus, probably about a.d. 141 or 142; and soon after his 
arrival he adopted the heresy of Cerdon. </P>
<P>(IV.) It is an interesting question as to what edition of the Holy Scriptures 
Tertullian used in his very copious quotations. It may at once be asserted that 
he did not cite from the Hebrew, although some writers have claimed for him, 
among his varied learning, a knowledge of the sacred language. Bp. Kaye 
observes, page 61, n. 1, that "he sometimes speaks as if he was acquainted with 
Hebrew," and refers to the <I>Anti-Marcion</I> iv. 39, the <I>Adv. Praxeam</I> 
v., and the <I>Adv. Judaeos</I> ix. Be this as it may, it is manifest that 
Tertullian's Scripture passages never resemble the Hebrew, but in nearly every 
instance the Septuagint, whenever, as is most frequently the case, that version 
differs from the original. In the New Testament there is, as might be expected, 
a tolerably close conformity to the Greek. There is, however, it must be 
allowed, a sufficiently frequent variation from the letter of both the Greek 
Testaments to justify Semler's suspicion that Tertullian always quoted from the 
old Latin version, whatever that might have been, which was current in the African church in the 
second and third centuries. The most valuable part of Semler's <I>Dissertatio de 
varia et incerta indole Liororum Q. S. F. Tertulliani</I> is his investigation 
of this very point. In section iv. he endeavours to prove this proposition: "Hic 
scriptor non in manibus habuit Graecos libros sacros;" and he states his conclusion thus: 
"Certissimum est nec Tertullianum nec Cyprianum nec ullum scriptorem e Latinis 
illis ecclesiasticis provocare unquam ad Graecorum librorum auctoritatem si vel 
maxime obscure aut contraria lectio occurreret;" and again: "Ex his satis certum 
est. Latinos satis diu secutos fuisse auctoritatem quorum librorum adversus 
Grcecos, nec concessisse nisi serius, cum Augustini et Hieronymi nova auctoritas 
juvare videretur." It is not ignorance of Greek which is imputed to Tertullian, 
for he is said to have well understood that language, and even to have composed 
in it. He probably followed the Latin, as writers now usually quote the 
authorized English, as being current and best known among their readers. 
Independent feeling, also, would have weight with such a temper as Tertullian's, 
to say nothing of the suspicion which largely prevailed in the African branch of 
the Latin church, that the Greek copies of the Scriptures were much corrupted by 
the heretics, who were chiefly, if not wholly, Greeks or Greek-speaking 
persons.</P>
<P>(V.) Whatever perverting effect Tertullian's secession to the sect of 
Montanus may have had on his judgment in his latest writings, it did not vitiate the work 
against Marcion. With a few trivial exceptions, this treatise may be read by the 
strictest Catholic without any feeling of annoyance. His lapse to Montanism is 
set down conjecturally as having taken place a.d. 199. Jerome, we have seen, 
attributed the event to his quarrel with the Roman clergy, but this is at least 
doubtful; nor must it be forgotten that Tertullian's mind s ems to have been 
peculiarly suited by nature to adopt the mystical notions and ascetic principles of Montanus. It is 
satisfactory to find that, on the whole, "the authority of Tertullian," as the 
learned Dr. Burton says, "upon great points of doctrine is considered to be 
little, if at all, affected by his becoming a Montanist." (<I>Lectures on Eccl. 
Hist</I>, vol. ii. p. 234.) Besides the different works which are expressly 
mentioned in the notes of this volume, recourse has been had by the translator 
to Dupin's <I>Hist. Eccl. Writers</I> (trans.), vol. i. pp. 69-86; Tillemont's 
<I>Mèmoires Hist. Eccl</I>. iii. 85-103; Dr. Smith's Greek and Roman Biography, 
articles "Marcion" and "Tertullian;" Schaff's article, in Herzog's 
<I>Cyclopaedia</I>, on "Tertullian;" Munter's <I>Primordia Eccl. Africanae</I>, 
pp. 118-150; Robertson's <I>Church Hist</I>. vol. i. pp. 70-77; Dr. P. Schaff's 
<I>Hist. of Christian Church</I> (New York, 1859, pp.511-519), and Archdeacon 
Evans' <I>Biography of the Early Church</I>, vol. i. (Lives of "Marcion," pp. 
93-122, and "Tertullian," pp. 325-363). This last work, though of a popular 
cast, shows a good deal of research and learning, expressed in the pleasant 
style of the once popular author of <I>The Rectory of Vale Head</I>. The 
translator has mentioned these works, because they are all quite accessible to 
the general reader, and will give him adequate information concerning the 
subject treated in the present volume.</P>
<P>To this introduction of Dr. Holmes must be added that of Mr. Thelwall, the 
translator of the Third volume in the Edinburgh Series, as follows:</P>
<P>To arrange chronologically the works (especially if numerous) of an author 
whose own date is known with tolerable precision, is not always or necessarily 
easy: witness the controversies as to the succession of St. Paul's epistles. To 
do this in the case of an author whose own date is itself a matter of 
controversy may therefore be reasonably expected to be still less so; and such 
is the predicament of him who attempts to perform this task for Tertullian. I 
propose to give a specimen or two of the difficulties with which the task is 
beset; and then to lay before the reader briefly a summary of the results at 
which eminent scholars, who have devoted much time and thought to the subject, 
have arrived. Such a course, I think, will at once afford him means of judging 
of the absolute impossibility of arriving at definite certainty in the matter; 
and induce him to excuse me if I prefer furnishing him with materials from which 
to deduce his own conclusions, rather than venturing on an <I>ex cathedra</I> 
decision on so doubtful a subject.</P>
<P>I. The book, as Dr. Holmes has reminded us, of the date of which we seem to have the surest evidence, is <I>Adv. Marc</I>. 
i. This book was in course of writing, as its author himself (C. 15) tells us, 
"in the fifteenth year of the empire of Severus." Now this date would be clear 
if there were no doubt as to which year of our era corresponds to Tertullian's 
fifteenth of Severus. Pamelius, however, says Dr. Holmes, makes it a.d. cog; 
Clinton, (whose authority is more recent and better,) 207.</P>
<P>2. Another book which promises to give some clue to its date is the <I>de 
Pallio</I>. The writer uses these phrases: "praesentis imperil <I>triplex virtus</I>;" "Deo 
<I>tot Augnstis in union favente</I>;" which show that there were at the time 
three persons unitedly bearing the title <I>Augusti</I>-not <I>Caesares</I> 
only, but the still higher <I>Augusti</I>;-while the remainder of that context, 
as well as the opening of c. I, indicates a time of peace of some considerable 
duration; a time of plenty; and a time during and previous to which great 
changes had taken place in the general aspect of the Roman Empire, and some 
particular traitor had been discovered and frustrated. Such a combination of 
circumstances might seem to fix the date with some degree of assurance. But 
unhappily, as Kaye reminds us, commentators cannot agree as to who the three Augusti are. Some say Severus, 
Caracalla, and <I>Albinus</I>; some say Severus, Caracalla, and <I>Geta</I>. 
Hence we have a difference of some twelve years or thereabouts in the 
computations. For Albinus was defeated by Severus in person, and fell by his own 
hand, in a.d. 197; and Geta, Severus' second son, brother of Caracalla, was not 
associated by his father with himself and his other son as <I>Augustus</I> until 
a.d. 208, though he had received the title of <I>Caesar</I> ten years before, in 
the same year in which <I>Caracalla</I> had received that of Augustus. For my own part, I may perhaps be allowed to say that I should incline to agree, 
like Salmasius, with those who assign the later date. The limits of the present 
Introduction forbid my entering at large into my reasons for so doing. I am, 
however, supported in it by the authority of Neander. In one point, though, I should hesitate to agree with Oehler, who appears to 
follow Salmasius and others herein,-namely, in understanding the expression "et 
cacto et rubo subdolae familiaritatis convulso" of <I>Albinus</I>. It seems to 
me the words might with more propriety be applied to Plautianus; and that in the 
word "familiaritatis" we may see (after Tertullian's fashion) a play upon the 
meaning, with a reference not only to the long-standing but mischievous intimacy 
which existed between Severus and his countryman (perhaps fellow-townsman) 
Plautianus, who for his harshness and cruelty is fitly compared to the prickly 
<I>cactus</I>. He alludes likewise to the alliance which this ambitious 
praetorian pr erect had contrived to contract with the <I>family</I> of the 
emperor, by the marriage of his daughter Plautilla to Caracalla,-an event which, 
as it turned out, led to his own death. Thus in the "<I>rubo</I>" there may be a 
reference to the ambitious and conceited "bramble" of Jotham's parable, and perhaps, too, to the "thistle" of Jehoash's. If this be so, the date would be at least approximately fixed, as Plautianus did 
not marry his daughter to Caracalla till a.d. 203, and was himself put to death 
in the following year, 204, while Geta, as we have seen, was made Augustus in 
208.</P>
<P>3. The date of the <I>Apology</I>, however, is perhaps at once the most 
contested, and the most strikingly illustrative of the difficulties to which 
allusion has been made. It is not surprising that its date <I>should</I> have 
been more disputed than that of other pieces, inasmuch as it is the best known, 
and (for some reasons) the most interesting and famous, of all our author's 
productions. In fact, the dates assigned to it by different authorities vary 
from Mosheim's 198 to that suggested by the very learned Allix, who assigns it 
to 217. </P>
<P>4. Once more. In the tract <I>de Monogamia</I> (c. 3) the author says that 
since the date of St. Paul's first Epistle to the Corinthians "about 160 years 
had elapsed." Here, again, did we only know with certainty the precise date of 
that epistle, we could ascertain "about" the date of the tract. But (a) the date 
of the epistle is itself variously given, Burton giving it as early as a.d. 52, 
Michaelis and Mill as late as 57; and (b) Tertullian only says, "<I>Armis 
circiter CLX. exinde productis</I>;" while the way in which, in the <I>ad 
Natt.</I>, within the short space of three chapters, he states first than 150, and then (in c. 9) that 300, years had not elapsed since the rise of 
the Christian name, leads us to think that here again he only desires to speak in round numbers, meaning perhaps <I>more</I> than 150, 
but <I>less</I> than 170.</P>
<P>These specimens must suffice, though it might be easy to add to them. There 
is, however, another classification of our author's writings which has been 
attempted. Finding the haplessness of strict chronological accuracy, 
commentators have seized on the idea that peradventure there might be found at 
all events some internal marks by which to determine which of them were written 
before, which after, the writer's secession to Montanism. It may be confessed 
that this attempt has been somewhat more successful than the other. Yet even 
here there are two formidable obstacles standing in our way. The first and 
greatest is, that the natural temper of Tertullian was from the first so akin to 
the spirit of Montanism, that, unless there occur distinct allusions to the "New 
Prophecy," or expressions specially connected with Montanistic phraseology, the 
<I>general tone</I> of any treatise is not a very safe guide. The second is, 
that the subject-matter of some of the treatises is not such as to afford much 
scope for the introduction of the peculiarities of a sect which professed to 
differ in discipline only, not doctrine, from the church at large.</P>
<P>Still the result of this classification seems to show one important feature 
of agreement between commentators, however they may differ upon details; and 
that is, that considerably the larger part of our author's rather voluminous 
productions must have been subsequent to his lamented secession. I think the best way to 
give the reader means for forming his own judgment will be, as I have said, to 
lay before him in parallel columns a tabular view of the disposition of the 
books by Dr. Neander and Bishop Kaye. These two modern writers, having given 
particular care to the subject, bringing to bear upon it all the advantages 
derived from wide reading, eminent abilities, and a diligent study of the works 
of preceding writers on the same questions, have a special right to be heard upon the matter in hand; and I think, if I may 
be allowed to say so, that, for calm judgment, and minute acquaintance with his 
author, I shall not be accused of undue partiality if I express my opinion that, 
as far as my own observation goes, the palm must be awarded to the Bishop. In 
this view I am supported by the fact that the accomplished Professor Ramsay,s 
follows Dr. Kaye's arrangement. I premise that Dr. Neander adopts a threefold 
division, into:</P>
<UL>
  <P>1. Writings which were occasioned by the relation of the Christians to the 
  heathen, and refer to their vindication of Christianity against the heathen; 
  attacks on heathenism; the sufferings and conduct of Christians under 
  persecution; and the intercourse of Christians with heathens:</P>
  <P>2. Writings which relate to Christian and church life, and to 
  ecclesiastical discipline</P></UL>
<P>3. The dogmatic and dogmatico-controversial treatises.</P>
<P>And under each head he subdivides into:</P>
<P align=center>Neander</P>
<P align=center>Kaye</P>
<P align=center>1.<I> Pre-Montanist.</I></P>
<P align=center>1<I>1. Pre Montanist (probably).</I></P>
<P align=center><I>2. Montanist</I></P>
<P align=center><I>17-21. </I></P>
<P align=center><I>2. Montanist (certainly).</I></P>
<P align=center><I>10</I></P>
<P align=center><I>4. Works respecting which nothing certain can be 
pronounced</I></P>
<P align=center><I>33. The</I></P>
<P><I>a</I>. Pre-Montanist writings: <I>b</I>. Post-Montanist writings: thus 
leaving no room for what Kaye calls "works respecting which nothing certain can 
be pronounced." For the sake of clearness, this order has not been followed in 
the table. On the other side, it will be seen that Dr. Kaye, while not assuming 
to speak with more than a reasonable probability, is careful so to arrange the 
treatises under each head as to show the order, so far as it is discoverable, in 
which the books under that head were published; i.e., if one book is quoted in 
another book, the book so quoted, if distinctly referred to as already before 
the world, is plainly anterior to that in which it is quoted. Thus, then, 
have:</P>
<P>A comparison of these two lists will show that the difference between the two 
great authorities is, as Kaye remarks, "not great; and with respect to some of 
the tracts on which we differ, the learned author expresses himself with great 
diffidence." The main difference, in fact, is that which affects two tracts upon kindred 
subjects, the <I>de Spectaculis</I>, and <I>Idololatria</I>, the <I>de Cultu 
Feminarum</I> (a subject akin to the other two), and the <I>adv. Judeos</I>. 
With reference to all these, except the last, to which I believe the Archdeacon 
does not once refer, the Bishop's opinion appears to have the support of 
Archdeacon Evans, whose learned and interesting essay, referred to in the note, 
appears in a volume published in 1837. Dr. Kaye's Lectures, on which his book is 
founded, were delivered in 1825. Of the date of his first edition I am not 
aware. Dr. Neander's <I>Antignostikus</I> also first appeared in 1825. The 
preface to his second edition bears date July 1, 1849 . As to the <I>adv. Judaeos</I>, I confess I agree with Neander in thinking 
that, at all events from the beginning of c. 9, it is spurious. If it be urged 
that Jerome expressly quotes it as Tertullian's, I reply, Jerome so quotes it, I 
believe, when he is expounding <I>Daniel</I>. Now all that the <I>adv. Jud.</I> 
has to say about <I>Daniel</I> ends with the end of c. 8. It is therefore quite 
compatible with the fact thus stated to recognize the earlier half of the book 
as genuine, and to reject the rest, beginning, as it happens, just after the 
eighth chapter, as spurious. Perhaps Dr. Neander's Jewish birth and training 
peculiarly fit him to be heard on this question. Nor do I think Professor Ramsay 
(in the article above alluded to) has quite seen the force of Kaye's own remarks 
on Neander. What he does say is equally creditable to his candour and his accuracy; namely: 
"The instances alleged by Dr. Neander, in proof of this position, are 
undoubtedly very remarkable; but if the concluding chapters of the tract are 
spurious, no ground seems to be left for asserting that the genuine portion was 
posterior to the third Book against Marcion, -and none, consequently, for asserting that it was written by a Montanist." With 
which remark I must draw these observations on the genuine extant works of 
Tertullian to a close.</P>
<P>The next point to which a brief reference must be made is the lost ivories of 
Tertullian, lists of these are given both by Oehler and by Kaye, viz.:</P>
<P>1. A Book on Aaron's Robes: mentioned by Jerome, Epist. 128, <I>ad Fabiolam 
de Veste Sacerdotali</I> (tom. ii. p. 586, Opp. ed. Bened.).</P>
<P>2. A Book on the Superstition of the Age. </P>
<P>3. A Book on the Submission of the Soul.</P>
<P>4. A Book on the Flesh and the Soul.</P>
<P>Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are known only by their titles, which are found in the Index 
to Tertullian's works given in the <I>Codex Agobardi</I>; but the tracts 
themselves are not extant in the ms., which appears to have once contained-</P>
<P>5. A Book on Paradise, named in the Index, and referred to in <I>de Anima 
55</I>, <I>adv. Marc</I>. iii. 12; and</P>
<P>6. A Book on the Hope of the Faithful: also named in the Index, and referred 
to <I>adv. Marc</I>. iii. 24; and by Jerome in his account of Papias, and on Ezek. xxxvi.; and by Gennadius of Marseilles. </P>
<P>7. Six Books on Ecstasy, with a seventh in reply to Apollonius: see Jerome. See, too, J. A. Fabricius on the words of the unknown author whom the Jesuit 
Sirmond edited under the name <I>Praedestinatus</I>; who gathers thence that 
"Soter, pope of the City, and Apollonius, bishop of the Ephesians, wrote a book against the Montanists; it reply to whom 
Tertullian, a Carthaginian presbyter, wrote." J. Pamelius thinks these seven 
books were originally published it Greek.</P>
<P>8. A Book in reply to the Apellesites (i.e. the followers of Apelles ): referred to in <I>de Carne Christi</I>, c. 8.</P>
<P>9. A Book on the Origin of the Soul, in reply to Hermogenes: referred to in <I>de Anima</I>, CC. 1, 3, 
22, 24</P>
<P>10. A Book on Fate: referred to by Fulgentius Planciades, p. 562, Merc.; also 
referred to as either written, or intended to be written, by Tertullian himself, 
<I>de Anima</I>, c. 20. Jerome states that there was extant, or had been extant, a book on Fate under the name 
of Minucius Felix, written indeed by a perspicuous author, but not in the style 
of Minucius Felix. This, Pamelius judged, should perhaps be rather ascribed to 
Tertullian.</P>
<P>11. A Book on the trinity. Jerome says "Novatian wrote a large volume on the Trinity, <I>as if making an epitome of a 
work of Tertullian's, which most men not knowing regard it as Cyprian's</I>." 
Novatian's book stood in Tertullian's name in the mss. Of J. Gangneius, who was 
the first to edit it; in a Malmesbury ms. which Sig. Gelenius used; and in 
others.</P>
<P>12. A Book addressed to a Philosophic Friend on the Straits of Matrimony. 
Both Kaye and Oehler are in doubt whether Jerome's words, by which some have been led to conclude that Tertullian wrote some book or books 
on this and kindred subjects, really imply as much, or whether they may not 
refer merely to those tracts and passages in his extant writings which touch 
upon such matters. Kaye hesitates to think that the "Book to a Philosophic 
Friend" is the same as the <I>de Exhortatiotce Castitatis</I>, because Jerome 
says Tertullian wrote on the subject of celibacy "in his youth;" but as Cave 
takes what Jerome elsewhere says of Tertullian's leaving the Church "<I>about 
the middle of his age</I>" to mean his <I>spiritual age</I>, the same sense 
might attach to his words here too, and thus obviate the Bishop's 
difficulty.</P>
<P>There are some other works which have been attributed to Tertullian-on 
Circumcision; on Animals Clean and Unclean; on the truth that God is a 
Judge-which Oehler likewise rejects, believing that the expressions of Jerome 
refer only to passages in the <I>Anti-Marcion</I> and other extant works. To 
Novatian Jerome does ascribe a distinct work on Circumcision, and this may (camp. II. just above) have given rise to the view that Tertullian 
had written one also.</P>
<P>There were, moreover, three treatises at least written by Tertullian <I>in 
Greek</I>. They are:</P>
<P>1. A Book on Public Shows. See <I>de Car</I>. c. 6.</P>
<P>2. A Book on Baptism. See <I>de Rapt</I>. c. 15.</P>
<P>3. A Book on the Veiling of Virgins. See de <I>V. V.</I> c. I.</P>
<P>Oehler adds that J. Pamelius, in his epistle dedicatory to Philip II. of 
Spain, makes mention of a Greek copy of Tertullian in the library of that king. 
This report, however, since nothing has ever been seen or heard of the said copy 
from that time, Oehler judges to be erroneous. </P>
<P>It remains briefly to notice the confessedly spurious works which the 
editions of Tertullian generally have appended to them. With these Kaye does not 
deal. The fragment, <I>adv. omnes Overuses</I>, Oehler attributes to Victorinus 
Petavionensis, i.e., Victorinus bishop of Pettaw, on the Drave, in Austrian 
Styria. It was once thought he ought to be called Pictaviensis, i.e. of 
Poictcers; but John Launoy has shown this to be an errors Victorinus is said by Jerome to have "understood 
Greek better than Latin; hence his works are excellent for the sense, but mean 
as to the style." Cave believes him to have beer a Greek by birth. Cassiodorus states him to have been once a professor of rhetoric. Jerome's statement agrees 
with the style of the tract in question; and Jerome distinctly says Victorinus 
did write <I>adversus omnes Haereses</I>. Allix leaves the question of its 
authorship quite uncertain. If Victorinus be the author, the book falls clearly 
within the Ante-Nicene period; for Victorinus fell a martyr in the Diocletian 
persecution, probably about a.d. 303.</P>
<P>The next fragment-"Of the Execrable Gods of the Heathens"-is of quite 
uncertain authorship. Oehler would attribute it "to some declaimer not quite 
ignorant of Tertullian's writings," but certainly not to Tertullian himself.</P>
<P>Lastly we come to the metrical fragments. Concerning these, it is perhaps 
impossible to assign them to their rightful owners. Oehler has not troubled 
himself much about them; but he seems to regard the Jonah as worthy of more 
regard than the rest, for he seems to have intended giving more labour to its 
editing at some future time. Whether he has ever done so, or given us his German 
version of Tertullian's own works, which, "si Deus adjuverit," he distinctly 
promises in his preface, I do not know. Perhaps the best thing to be done under 
the circumstances is to give the judgment of the learned Peter Allix. It may be 
premised that by the celebrated George Fabricius -who published his great work, <I>Poetarum Veterum Ecclesiasticorum Opera 
Christiana</I>, etc., in 1564-the <I>Five Books in Reply to Marcion</I>, and the 
Judgment of the lord, are ascribed to Tertullian, the Genesis and Sodom to 
Cyprian. Pamelius likewise seems to have ascribed the <I>Five Books</I>, the 
<I>Jonah</I>, and the <I>Sodom</I> to Tertullian; and according to Lardner, Bishop Bull likewise attributed the 
<I>Five Books</I> to him. They have been generally ascribed to the Victorinus above mentioned. Tillemont, 
among others, thinks they may well enough be his Rigaltius is content to demonstrate that they are not Tertullian's, but leaves 
the real authorship without attempting to decide it. Of the others the same 
eminent critic says, "They seem to have been written at Carthage, at an age not 
far removed from Tertullian's." Allix, after observing that Pamelius is inconsistent with himself in attributing 
the <I>Genesis</I> and <I>Sodom</I> at one time to Tertullian, at another to 
Cyprian, rejects both views equally, and assigns the Genesis with some 
confidence to Salvian, a presbyter of Marseilles, whose "floruit" Cave gives 
cir. 440, a contemporary of Gennadius, and a copious author. To this it is, 
Allix thinks, that Gennadius alludes in his <I>Catalogue of Illustrious Men</I>. 
c. 77.</P>
<P>The <I>Judgment of the Lord</I> Allix ascribes to one Verecundus, an African 
bishop, whose date he finds it difficult to decide exactly. He refers to two of 
the name: one Bishop of Tunis, whom Victor of Tunis in his chronicle mentions as 
having died in exile at Chalcedon A.D. 552; the other Bishop of Noba, who 
visited Carthage with many others A.D. 482, at the summons of King Huneric, to 
answer there for their faith;-and would ascribe the poem to the former, thinking 
that he finds an allusion to it in the article upon that Verecundus in the <I>de 
Viris Illustribus</I> of Isidore of Seville. Oehler agrees with him. The <I>Five 
Books</I> Allix seems to hint may be attributed to some imitator of the 
Victorinus of Pettaw named above. Oehler attributes them rather to one 
Victorinus, or Victor, of Marseilles, a rhetorician, who died a.d. 450. He 
appears in G. Fabricius as Claudius Marius Victorinus, writer of a Commentary on 
Genesis, and an epistle <I>ad Salomonem Abbata</I>, both in verse, and of some 
considerable length. </P>
