<P id=iii.vii.xi.p0.1><B>Gnosticism.</B> The zeal with which a learner commences 
the study of ecclesiastical history is not unfrequently damped at an early 
stage, when he finds that, in order to know the history of religious thought in 
the 2nd cent., he must make himself acquainted with speculations so wild and so 
baseless that it is irksome to read them and difficult to believe that time was 
when acquaintance with them was counted as what alone deserved the name of 
"knowledge." But it would be a mistake to think too disdainfully of those early 
heretics who go by the common name of Gnostics. In the first place, it may be 
said in their excuse that the problems which they undertook to solve were among 
the most difficult with which the human intellect has ever grappled--namely, to 
explain the origin of evil, and to make it conceivable how the multiplicity of 
finite existence can all have been derived from a single absolute unconditioned 
principle. And besides, these speculators only did what learned theologians have 
constantly since endeavoured to do--namely, combine the doctrines which they 
learned from revelation with the results of what they regarded as the best 
philosophy of their own day, so as to obtain what seemed to them the most 
satisfactory account and explanation of the facts of the universe. Every union 
of philosophy and religion is the marriage of a mortal with an immortal: the 
religion lives; the philosophy grows old and dies. When the philosophic element 
of a theological system becomes antiquated, its explanations which contented one 
age become unsatisfactory to the next, and there ensues what is spoken of as a 
conflict between religion and science; whereas, in reality, it is a conflict 
between the science of one generation and that of a succeeding one. If the 
religious speculations of the 2nd cent. appear to us peculiarly unreasonable, it 
is because the philosophy incorporated with them is completely alien to modern 
thought. That philosophy gave unlimited licence to the framing of hypotheses, 
and provided that the results were in tolerable accordance with the facts, no 
other proof was required that the causes which these hypotheses assumed were 
really in operation. The <I>Timaeus</I> of Plato is a favourable specimen of the 
philosophic writings which moulded the Gnostic speculations; and the interval 
between that and a modern treatise on physics is fully as wide as between 
Gnosticism and modern scientific theology. So it has happened that modern 
thought has less sympathy with heretical theories deeply coloured by the 
philosophy of their own time than with the plain common sense of a church writer 
such as Irenaeus, which led him to proceed by the positive historical method, 
and reject what was merely fanciful and speculative. And it may be said that 
deeply important as were some of the particular questions discussed in the 
conflict between the church and Gnosticism, an even more important issue of that 
conflict was the decision of the method by which religious knowledge was to be 
arrived at. The Gnostics generally held that the Saviour effected redemption by 
making a revelation of knowledge, yet they but feebly attempted to connect 
historically their teaching with his; what was derived from Him was buried under 
elements taken freely from heathen mythologies and philosophies, or springing 
from the mere fancy of the speculator, so that, if Gnosticism had triumphed, all 
that is distinctively Christian would have disappeared. In opposition to them, 
church writers were led to emphasize the principle that that alone is to be 
accounted true knowledge of things divine which can be shewn by historical 
tradition, written or oral, to have been derived from the teaching of Christ and 
His apostles, a principle the philosophic justice of which must be admitted if 
Christ be owned as having filled the part in the enlightenment of the world 
which orthodox and Gnostics alike attributed to Him. Thus, by the conflict with 
Gnosticism reverence in the church was deepened for the authority of revelation 
as restraining the licence of human speculation, and so the channel was marked 
out within the bounds of which religious thought continued for centuries to 
flow.</P>
<P id=iii.vii.xi.p0.2>We deal here with some general aspects of the subject, 
referring to the articles on the chief Gnostic teachers for details as to the 
special tenets of the different Gnostic sects.</P>
<P id=iii.vii.xi.p0.3><I>Use of the Word Gnosticism.</I>--In logical order we 
ought to begin by defining Gnosticism, and so fixing what extension is to be 
given to the application of the term, a point on which writers are not agreed. 
Baur, for instance, reckons among Gnostics the sectaries from whom the 
Clementine writings emanated, although on some of the most fundamental points 
their doctrines are diametrically opposed to those commonly reckoned as Gnostic. 
We conform to more ordinary usage in giving to the word a narrower sense, but 
this is a matter on which controversy would be only verbal, Gnosticism not being 
a word which has in its own nature a definite meaning. There is no difficulty in 
naming common characteristics of the sects commonly called Gnostic, though 
perhaps none of them is distinctive enough to be made the basis of a logical 
definition. They professed to be able to trace their doctrine to the apostles. 
Basilides was said to have learned from a companion of St. Peter; gospels were 
in circulation among them which purported to have been written by Philip, 
Thomas, and other apostles; and they professed to be able to find their 
doctrines in the canonical scriptures by methods of allegorical interpretation 
which, however forced, could easily be paralleled in the procedure of orthodox 
writers. If we made our definition turn on the claim to the possession of such a 
Gnosis and to the title of Gnostic, we should have to count Clement of 
Alexandria among Gnostics and <I>I. Timothy</I> among Gnostic writings; for the 
church writers refused to<PB id=Page_395 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y"

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>surrender these titles to the heretics and, claiming to 
be the true Gnostics, branded the heretical Gnosis as "falsely so called." If we 
fix our attention on the predominance of the speculative over the practical in 
Gnosticism, which, as Baur truly remarks, led men to regard Christianity less as 
a means of salvation than as furnishing the principles of a philosophy of the 
universe, we must allow that since their time very many orthodox writings have 
been open to the same criticism. We come very close to a definition if we make 
the criterion of Gnosticism to be the establishment of a dualism between spirit 
and matter; and, springing out of this, the doctrine that the world was created 
by some power different from the supreme God, yet we might not be able to 
establish that this characteristic belongs to every sect which we count as 
Gnostic; and if we are asked why we do not count such sects as the Manicheans 
among the Gnostics, the best answer is that usage confines the word to those 
sects which arose in the ferment of thought when Christianity first came into 
contact with heathen philosophy, excluding those which clearly began later. A 
title of honour claimed by these sectaries for themselves, and at first refused 
them by their opponents, was afterwards adopted as the most convenient way of 
designating them.</P>
<P id=iii.vii.xi.p0.4>We have no reason to think that the earliest Gnostics 
intended to found sects separated from the church and called after their own 
names. Their disciples were to be Christians, only elevated above the rest as 
acquainted with deeper mysteries, and called <FONT face=symbol>gnwstikoi</FONT>, 
because possessed of a Gnosis superior to the simple faith of the multitude. 
Probably the earliest instance of the use of the word is by Celsus, quoted by 
Origen, v. 61, where, speaking of the multiplicity of Christian sects, he says 
that there were some who professed to be Gnostics. Irenaeus (i. xxv. 5, p. 104), 
speaking of the Carpocratians and in particular of that school of them which 
Marcellina established at Rome, says that they called themselves Gnostics. It is 
doubtless on the strength of this passage that Eusebius (<I>H. E.</I> iv. 7), 
quoting Irenaeus in the same context, calls Carpocratea the father of the sect 
called that of the Gnostics. In the habitual use of the word by Irenaeus himself 
it does not occur as limited to Carpocratians. Irenaeus, in his first book, when 
he has gone through the sects called after the names of heretical teachers, 
gives in a kind of appendix an account of a number of sects in their general 
characteristics Ophite, but he does not himself use that name. He calls them 
"multitudo Gnosticorum," tracing their origin to Simon Magus, and counting them 
as progenitors of the Valentinians. And constantly we have the expression 
Basilidians, Valentinians, etc., "et reliqui Gnostici," where, by the latter 
appellation, the Ophite sects are specially intended. The form of expression 
does not exclude from the title of Gnostic the sects named after their founders; 
and the doctrine of the Valentinians is all through the work of Irenaeus a 
branch of "Gnosis falsely so called"; yet it is usually spoken of less as 
Gnosticism than as a development of Gnosticism, and the Valentinians are 
described as more Gnostic than the Gnostics, meaning by the latter word the 
Ophite sects already mentioned. In the work of Hippolytus against heresies, the 
name is almost exclusively found in connexion with the sect of the Naassenes or 
Ophites, and three or four times it is repeated (v. 2, p. 93; 4, p. 94; 11, p. 
123) that these people call themselves Gnostics, claiming that they alone "knew 
the depths." The common source of Epiphanius and Philaster had an article on the 
Nicolaitanes, tracing the origin of the Gnostics to Nicolas the Deacon (see also 
Hippolytus, vii. 36, p. 258, and the statement of Irenaeus [II. ii. p. 188] that 
Nicolaitanism was a branch of Gnosis). Epiphanius divides this article into two, 
making the Gnostics a separate heresy (<I>Haer.</I> 26). Hence ancient usage 
leaves a good deal of latitude to modern writers in deciding which of the 
2nd-cent. sects they will count as Gnostic.</P>
<P id=iii.vii.xi.p0.5><I>Classification of Gnostic Sects.</I>--Some general 
principles of philosophic classification may be easily agreed on, but when they 
come to be applied, it is found that there are some sects to which it is not 
obvious where to assign a place, and that some sects are separated whose 
affinities are closer than those of others which are classed together. A very 
important, though not a complete, division is that made by Clement of Alexandria 
(<I>Strom.</I> iii. 5) into the ascetic and licentious sects: both parties 
agreeing in holding the essential evil of matter; the one endeavouring by 
rigorous abstinence to free as much as possible man's soul from the bondage to 
which it is subjected by union with his material part, and refusing to marry and 
so enthral new souls in the prisons of bodies; the other abandoning as desperate 
any attempt to purify the hopelessly corrupt body, and teaching that the 
instructed soul ought to hold itself unaffected by the deeds of the body. All 
actions were to it indifferent. The division of Neander is intended to embrace a 
wider range than that just described. Taking the common doctrine of the Gnostic 
sects that the world was made by a Being different from the supreme God, he 
distinguishes whether that Being was held to have acted in subordination to the 
Supreme, and on the whole to have carried out his intentions, or to have been 
absolutely hostile to the supreme God. Taking into account the generally 
acknowledged principle that the Creator of the world was the same as the God 
worshipped by the Jews, we see that Gnostics of the second class would be 
absolutely hostile to Judaism, which those of the former class might accept as 
one of the stages ordained by the Supreme in the enlightenment of the world. 
Thus Neander's division classifies sects as not unfriendly to Judaism or as 
hostile to it; the former class taking its origin in those Alexandrian schools 
where the authority of such teachers as Philo had weight, the latter among 
Christian converts from Oriental philosophy whose early education had given them 
no prejudices in favour of Judaism. Gieseler divides into Alexandrian Gnostics, 
whose teaching was mainly influenced by the Platonic philosophy, and Syrian 
strongly affected by Parsism. In the former the emanation doctrine was 
predominant, in the latter dualism. Undoubtedly the most satisfactory 
classification would be if it were possible, as Matter suggested, to have one founded on the history of the generation of the sects, distinguishing the school where Gnosticism had its beginning, and naming the schools which successively in different places altered in different directions the original scheme. But a good classification of this kind is rendered impossible by the scantiness of our materials for the history of Gnosticism. Irenaeus is the first to give any full details, and he may be counted two generations later than Valentinus; for Marcus, the disciple of Valentinus, was resisted by one whom Irenaeus looked up to with respect as belonging to the generation above his own. The interval between Valentinus and the beginning of Gnosticism was, moreover, probably quite as great as that between Valentinus and Irenaeus. The phrase used by Hippolytus in telling us that the Naassenes boasted that they alone "knew the depths" was also a watchword of the false teachers reprobated in the Apocalypse (Rev. ii. 24). We can hardly avoid the inference that these Naassenes inherited a phrase continuously in use among heretical teachers since before the publication of the Revelation. Of the writers who would deny the pastoral epistles to be St. Paul's, a large proportion date the Revelation only 2 or 3 years after St. Paul's death ; therefore, whether or not it was St. Paul who wrote of the "falsely called knowledge," it remains probable that heretical pretenders to Gnosis had arisen in his lifetime. If the beginnings of Gnosticism were thus in apostolic times, we need not be surprised that the notices of its origin given by Irenaeus more than a century afterwards are so scanty; and that the teachers to whom its origin has been ascribed, Simon, Menander, Nicolas, Cerinthus, remain shadowy or legendary characters. It follows that conclusions as to the order of succession of the early Gnostic sects and their obligations one to another are very insecure. Still, some general facts in the history of the evolution of Gnosticism may be considered fairly certain; and we are disposed to accept the classification of Lipsius and count three stages in the progress of Gnosticism, even though there may be doubt to what place a particular sect is to be assigned. The birthplace of Gnosticism may be said to be Syria, if we include in that Palestine and Samaria, where church tradition places the activity of those whom it regards as its founders, Simon and Menander. It may also be inferred from the use made of O.T. and of Hebrew words that Gnosticism sprang out of Judaism. The false teaching combated in Colossians, which has several Gnostic features, is also distinctly Jewish, insisting on the observance of Sabbaths and new moons. The Epp. to Timothy and Titus, dealing with a somewhat later development of Gnosticism, describe the false teachers as "of the circumcision," "professing to be teachers of the law" and propounders of "Jewish fables." It is not unlikely that what these epistles characterize as "profane and old wives' fables" may be some of the Jewish Haggadah of which the early stages of Gnosticism are full. The story of Ialdabaoth, e.g., told by Irenaeus (i. 30), we hold to date from the very beginning of Gnosticism, if not in its present shape, at least in some rudimentary form, as fragments of it appear in different Gnostic systems, especially the representation of the work of Creation as performed by an inferior being, who still fully believed himself to be the Supreme, saying, "I am God, and there is none beside me," until, after this boast, his ignorance was enlightened. The Jewish Cabbala has been asserted to be the parent of Gnosticism; but the records of Cabbalistic doctrine are quite modern, and any attempt to pick out the really ancient parts must be attended with uncertainty. Lipsius (p. 270, and Gritz, referred to by him) shews that the Cabbala is certainly not older than Gnosticism, its relation to it being not that of a parent, but of a younger brother. If there be direct obligation, the Cabbala is the borrower, but many common features are to be explained by regarding both as branches from the same root, and as alike springing from the contact of Judaism with the religious beliefs of the farther East. Jewish Essenism especially furnished a soil favourable to the growth of Gnosticism, with which it seems to have had in common the doctrine of the essential evil of matter, as appears from the denial by the Essenes of the resurrection of the body and from their inculcation of a disciplining of man's material part by very severe asceticism. (See Lightfoot, Colossians, 119?? seq.) Further, the Ebionite sects which sprang out of Essenism, while they professed the strongest attachment to the Mosaic law, not only rejected the authority of the prophetical writings, but dealt in a very arbitrary manner with those parts of the Pentateuch which conflicted with their peculiar doctrines. We have parallels to this in theories of some of the early Gnostic sects which referred the Jewish prophetical books to the inspiration of beings inferior to Him by Whom the law was given, as well as in the arbitrary modes of criticism applied by some of the later sects to the books of Scripture. A form of Gnosticism thus developed from Judaism when the latter was brought into contact with the mystic speculations of the East, whether we suppose Essenism to have been a stage in the process of growth or both to have been independent growths under similar circumstances of development. Lipsius notes as the characteristics of those sects which he counts as belonging to the first stage of Gnosticism that they still move almost or altogether within the circle of the Jewish religious history, and that the chief problem they set themselves is the defining the relation between Christianity and Judaism. The solutions at which they arrive are very various. Those Jewish sects whose Essenism passed into the Ebionitism of the Clementines regarded Christianity as essentially identical with Judaism, either religion being sufficient for salvation. These sects are quite orthodox as to the Creation, their utmost deviation (if it can be called so) from the received belief being the ascription of Creation to the immanent wisdom of God. Other Jewish speculators came to think of the formation of matter as accomplished by a subordinate being, carrying out, it may be, the will of the Supreme, but owing to his finiteness and ignorance doing the wont with many

imperfections. Then came the theory that
this subordinate being was the God of the
Jews, to which nation he had issued many
commandments that were not good, though
overruled by the Supreme so as to carry out
His ends. Lastly came the theory of the
Cainites and other extreme Ophite sects, which
represented the God of the Jews as the determined
enemy of the Supreme, and as one
whose commands it was the duty of every
enlightened Gnostic to disobey. With all their
variety of results, these sects agreed in the
importance attached to the problem of the
true relations of Judaism to Christianity.
They do make use of certain heathen principles
of cosmogony, but these such as already
had become familiar to Syriac Judaism, and
introduced not so much to effect a reconciliation
between Christianity and heathenism as
to give an explanation of the service rendered
to the world by the publication of Christianity,
the absolute religion. This is made mainly
to consist in the aid given to the soul in its
struggles to escape the bonds of finiteness and
darkness, by making known to it the supersensual
world and awaking it to the consciousness
of its spiritual origin. Regarding this
knowledge as the common privilege of Christians,
the first speculators would count their
own possession of it as differing rather in
degree than in kind; and so it is not easy to
draw a sharp line of distinction between their
doctrine on the subject of Gnosis and that
admitted as orthodox. Our Lord had described
it as the privilege of His disciples to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven;
later when His followers learned of a suffering
Messiah, and of the fulfilment in Jesus of the
types of the Mosaic law, they felt that the veil
had been removed for them, and that they
enjoyed a knowledge of the meaning of the
O.T. Scriptures to which their unconverted
brethren were strangers. This feeling pervades
the Ep. to the <I>Hebrews</I>, and still more
that of Barnabas. Another doctrine which
St. Paul describes as a mystery formerly kept
secret, but now revealed through his gospel, is
the admission of the Gentiles on equal terms
with the Jews to the inheritance of the kingdom
of Christ. It was no part of orthodox
Christian doctrine that all Christians possessed
the true Gnosis in equal degree. Some required
to be fed with milk, not with strong
meat, and had not their senses exercised by
reason of use to discern between good and
evil. Clement of Alexandria distinguished
between faith and knowledge. The difference,
therefore, between the Gnostic doctrine and
that of the church mainly depends on the
character of what was accounted knowledge,
much of the Gnostic so-called knowledge
consisting in acquaintance with the names of
a host of invisible beings and with the formulae
which could gain their favour.</P>

<P>Gnosticism, in its first stage, did not
proceed far outside the limits of Syria. What
Lipsius counts as the second stage dates from
the migration of Gnostic systems to Alexandria,
where the myths of Syriac Gnosis came
to be united to principles of Grecian philosophy.
Different Gnostic systems resulted
according as the principles of this of that
Grecian school were adopted. Thus, in the
system of Valentinus, the Pythagorean Platonic
philosophy predominates, the Stoic in
that of the Basilidians as presented by Hippolytus.
In these systems, tinged with
Hellenism, the Jewish religion is not so much
controverted or disparaged as ignored. The
mythological personages among whom in the
older Gnosis the work of creation was distributed
are in these Hellenic systems replaced
by a kind of abstract beings (of whom the
Valentinian aeons are an example) which
personify the different stages of the process
by which the One Infinite Spirit communicates
and reveals itself to derived existences. The
distinction between faith and knowledge
becomes sharpened, the persons to whom
faith and knowledge respectively are to serve
as guides being represented as essentially
different in nature. The most obvious division
of men is into a kingdom of light and a
kingdom of darkness. The need of a third
class may have first made itself felt from the
necessity of finding a place for members of the
Jewish religion, who stood so far above
heathenism, so far below Christianity. The
Platonic trichotomy of body, soul, and spirit
afforded a principle of threefold classification,
and men are divided into earthly 


<I>(uaWOl </I>


or
xoi;rcoi), animal (tPuxucol), and spiritual (rveu


<I>/.(.(tTLKOL). </I>


In these Hellenic Gnostic systems
the second class represents not Jews but
ordinary Christians, and the distinction between them and the Gnostics themselves (who
are the spiritual) rests on an assumed difference of nature which leaves little room for
human free will. Salvation by faith and
corresponding works is disparaged as suitable
only for the psychical, the better sort of whom
may, by this means, be brought to as high a
position in the order of the universe as their
nature is capable of ; but the really spiritual
need not these lower methods of salvation. It
suffices for them to have the knowledge of
their true nature revealed for them to become
certain of shaking off all imprisoning bonds
and soaring to the highest region of all. Thus
ordinary historical Christianity runs the risk
of meeting the same fate in the later Gnostic
systems that befell Judaism in the earlier. The
doctrines and facts of the religion are only
valued so far as they can be made subservient
to the peculiar notions of Gnosticism; and
the method of allegorical interpretation was
so freely applied to both Testaments that all
the solid parts of the religion were in danger
of being volatilized away.

</P>

<P>The natural consequence of this weakening
of the historic side of Christianity was the
removal of all sufficient barrier against the
&#39;intrusion of heathen elements into the systems;
while their moral teaching was injuriously
affected by the doctrine that the
spiritual were secure of salvation by necessity
of their nature and irrespectively of their
conduct. Gnosticism, in its third stage,
struggles in various ways to avoid these faults,
and so again draws nearer to the teaching
of the Catholic church. Thus the 
Docetae
of Hippolytus allow of immense variety of
classes, corresponding to the diversity of
ideas derived from the world of aeons, which
each has received; while again they deny to
none a share in our Lord&#39;s redemption, but

own that 


members of different sects 


are 


entitled, each in his degree, to claim kinship with
Jesus and to obtain forgiveness of sins through
Him. So again in one of the latest of the
Gnostic systems, that of PisTis 


SOPHIA, 


there
is no assertion of an essential diversity of
nature among men, but the immense development of ranks and degrees in the spiritual
world, which that work professes to reveal, is
used so as to provide for every man a place
according to his works. In the system of
Marcion, too, the theory of essentially different
classes is abandoned; the great boast of
Christianity is its universality; and the
redemption of the Gospel is represented, not
as the mere rousing of the pneumatic soul to
consciousness of privileges all along possessed,
but as the introduction of a real principle of
moral life through the revelation of a God of
love forgiving sins through Christ.

</P>
<P>

We add brief notes on a few main points
of the Gnostic systems.

</P>
<P>

Creation. anal Cosmogony.-Philo 


<I>(de Op</I>


.


<I>Mund.) had </I>


inferred from the expression, " Let
us make man," of 


<I>Genesis </I>


that God had used
other beings as assistants in the creation of
man, and he explains in this way why man is
capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the
origin of the latter to God, of the former to
His helpers in the work of creation. The
earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of
creation to angels, some of them using the
same passage in 


<I>Genesis </I>


(Justin. 


<I>Dial. cum
</I>


Tyyph. c. 67).

</P>
<P>

<I>Doctrine with </I>


respect to Judaism.-The doctrine that the Creator of the world is not the
supreme God leads at once to the question,
What then is to be thought of the God of the
Jews, who certainly claimed to have created
the world ? This question is most distinctly
answered in the doctrine of the Ophite system


<I>(Iyen. </I>


i. 30). 


According to it he who claimed
to be a jealous God, acknowledging none other,
was led by sheer ignorance to make a false
pretension. He was in truth none other than
the chief of the creative angels, holding but a
subordinate place in the constitution of the
universe. It was he who forbad to Adam and
Eve that knowledge by which they might be
informed that he had superiors, and who on
their disobedience cast them out of Paradise.

</P>

<I>Doctrine concerning the Nature of Man.-
<P>
</I>


With the myth, told by Saturninus, of the
animation of a previously lifeless man by a
spark of light; from above, he connected the
doctrine, in which he was followed by almost
all Gnostic sects, that there would be no
resurrection of the body, the spark of light
being taken back on death to the place whence
it had come, and man&#39;s material part being
resolved into its elements. Saturninus is said
to have taught the doctrine, antagonistic to
that of man&#39;s free will, that there were classes
of men by nature essentially different, and of
these he counted two-the good and the
wicked. The doctrine became common to
many Gnostic, systems that the human frame
contained a heavenly element struggling to
return to its native place.

</P>

<I>Redemption and Christology.-The Gnostic
<P>
</I>


systems generally represent man&#39;s spirit as
imprisoned in matter, and needing release.
The majority recognize the coming of Christ


as a turning-point in human affairs, but almost
all reduce the Redeemer&#39;s work to the impartation of knowledge and the disclosure of
mysteries. With regard to the nature of
Christ, the lowest view is held by Justinus,
who describes Jesus but as a shepherd boy
commissioned by an angel to be the bearer of
a divine revelation, and who attributes to Him
at no time any higher character. Carpocrates makes Jesus a man like others, only of
more than ordinary steadfastness and purity
of soul, possessing no prerogatives which other
men may not attain in the same or even higher
degree if they follow, or surpass, His example.
Besides furnishing an example, He was also
supposed to have made a revelation of trutta,
to secret traditions of which the followers of
Carpocrates appealed. At the opposite pole
from those who see in the Saviour a mere man
are those who deny His humanity altogether.
We know from St. John&#39;s epistle that the
doctrine that our Lord had not really come in
the flesh was one which at an early time
troubled the church.

</P>
<P>

Authorities.-The great work of Irenaeus
against heresies is the chief storehouse whence
writers, both ancient and modern, have drawn
their accounts of the Gnostic sects. It was
primarily directed against the then most
popular form of the heresy of Valentinus, and
hence this form of Gnosticism has thrown all
others intothe shade, andmanymodern writers
when professing to describe Gnosticism really
describe Valentinianism. Irenaeus was largely
copied by Tertullian, who, however, was an
independent authority on Marcionism ; by
Hippolytus, who in his work against heresies
adds, however, large extracts from his independent reading of Gnostic works; and by
Epiphanius, who also gives a few valuable
additions from other sources. The 


<I>Stromateis
</I>


of Clement of Alexandria, though provokingly
desultory and unsystematic, furnish much
valuable information about Gnosticism, which
was still a living foe of the church. The
writings of Origen also yield much important
information. The matter, not borrowed from
Irenaeus, to be gleaned from later heresiologists is scanty and of doubtful value.
