<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p0.1><B>Marcion,</B> a noted and permanently influential 
heretic of the 2nd cent.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p0.2><I>Life.</I>--Justin Martyr (<I>Apol.</I> cc. 26, 58) 
mentions Simon and Menander as having been instigated by demons to introduce 
heresy into the church, and goes on to speak of Marcion as still living, 
evidently regarding him as the most formidable heretic of the day. <A class=Note 
href="http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.xiii.ii.htm#_fnf1" 
name=_fnb1><SUP class=Note>1</SUP></A> He states that he was a native of Pontus 
who had made many disciples out of every nation, and refers for a more detailed 
refutation to a separate treatise of his own, one sentence of which has been 
preserved by Irenaeus (iv. 6). This work seems to have been extant in the time 
of Photius (Cod. 154). Irenaeus also states that Marcion came from Pontus. He 
adds that thence he came to Rome, where he became an adherent, and afterwards 
the successor, of Cerdo, a Syrian teacher who, though he made public confession 
and was reconciled, privately continued teaching heretical doctrine, was 
betrayed by some of his hearers, and again separated. Irenaeus places the coming 
of Cerdo to Rome in the episcopate of Hyginus, which lasted four years, ending, 
according, to Lipsius, 139, 140, or 141. Irenaeus places the activity of Marcion 
at Rome under Anicetus ("invaluit sub Aniceto"), whose episcopate of 12 years 
began in 154. He says (iii. 3) that Marcion meeting Polycarp at Rome (probably 
154 or 155) claimed recognition, on which Polycarp answered, "I recognize thee 
as the firstborn of Satan." Irenaeus contemplated (iii. 12) a separate treatise 
against Marcion. There is no direct evidence of his having carried out this 
design, but as its proposed method is stated to have been the confutation of 
Marcion by means of his own gospel, and as this is precisely the method followed 
by Tertullian, who is elsewhere largely indebted to Irenaeus, the work of 
Irenaeus may have been then written and known to Tertullian. It has been stated 
under Hippolytus how the 
contents of the lost <I>Syntagma</I> of Hippolytus are inferred. It appears to 
have named Sinope as Marcion's native city (Epiph. 42, Philast. 45), of which 
his father was bishop; and to have stated that he was obliged to leave home 
because he seduced a virgin and was excommunicated by his father (Epiph., 
Pseudo-Tert. 17). Epiphanius tells, apparently on the same authority, that 
Marcion, his frequent entreaties for absolution having failed, went to Rome, 
where he arrived after the death of Hyginus, that he begged restoration from the 
presbyters there, but they declared themselves unable to act contrary to the 
decision of his venerated father. The mention of presbyters as then the ruling 
power in the church of Rome, and their professed inability to reverse the 
decision of a provincial bishop, indicate a date earlier than that of 
Epiphanius; but Epiphanius further states that Marcion's quarrel with the 
presbyters was not only because they did not restore him to church communion, 
but also because they did not make him bishop. This has been generally 
understood to mean bp. of Rome, and possibly Epiphanius intended this, but he 
does not say so. His words are <FONT face=symbol>wV ouk apeilhfe thn proedrian 
te</FONT>, <FONT face=symbol>kai thn eisdusin thV ekklhsiaV</FONT>. It is absurd 
that an excommunicated foreigner should dream of being made bishop of a church 
from which he was asking in vain for absolution. Epiphanius must have 
misunderstood some expression he found in his authority, or Marcion must have 
been already a bishop (possibly one of his father's suffragans), been deposed, 
and was seeking at Rome both restoration to communion and recognition of his 
episcopal dignity. Optatus alone directly countenances the latter view, speaking 
of Marcion (iv. 5, p. 74) as "ex episcopo factus apostata." But there is 
indirect confirmation in the fact which we learn from Adamantius (i. 15; xvi. 
264, Lommatz.) that Marcion was afterwards recognized as bishop by his own 
followers and was<PB id=Page_694 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y"

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>the head of a succession of Marcionite bishops 
continuing down to the writer's own day. The Marcionites appear to have had no 
difference with the orthodox as to the forms of church organization. 
Tertullian's words are well-known, "faciunt et favos vespae, faciunt et 
ecclesias Marcionitae" (<I>adv. Marcion.</I> iv. 5). We may conclude that 
episcopacy was the settled constitution of the church before the time of the 
Marcionite schism, else Marcion would not have adopted it in his new sect, and 
it seems more likely that Marcion had been consecrated to the office before the 
schism than that he obtained consecration afterwards, or by his own authority 
took the office to himself and appointed others to it, a thing unexampled in the 
church, of which we should surely have heard if Marcion had done it. Many 
critics have believed that the statement as to the cause of Marcion's 
excommunication arose from the misunderstanding of a common figurative 
expression, and that it meant that Marcion by heresy had corrupted the pure 
virgin church. We are inclined to adopt this view, not on account of the 
confessed austerity of Marcion's subsequent life and doctrines, which are not 
inconsistent with his having fallen into sins of the flesh in his youth, but 
because the story goes on to tell of Scripture difficulties propounded by 
Marcion to the Roman presbyters and of his rejection of their solutions. If the 
question had been whether pardon were to be given for an offence against 
morality, neither party would have been likely to enter into theological 
controversy, whereas such discussion would naturally arise if the cause of 
excommunication had been heresy.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p0.5>The story proceeds to say that he asked the Roman 
presbyters to explain the texts, "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit," 
and "No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment," texts from which 
he himself deduced that works in which evil is to be found could not proceed 
from the good God, and that the Christian dispensation could have nothing in 
common with the Jewish. Rejecting the explanation offered him by the presbyters, 
he broke off the interview with a threat to make a schism in their church. The 
beginning of Marcionism was so early that the church writers of the end of the 
2nd cent., who are our best authorities, do not themselves seem able to tell 
with certainty the story of its commencement. But we know that the heresy of 
Marcion spread itself widely over many countries. Epiphanius names as infected 
by it in his time, Rome and Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Syria, Cyprus, and 
even Persia. Its diffusion in the latter half of the 2nd cent. is proved by its 
antagonists in numerous countries: Dionysius in Corinth writing to Nicomedia, 
Philip in Crete, Theophilus in Antioch, besides Modestus (Eus. iv. 25), Justin, 
Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, Rhodo, and Tertullian. Bardesanes 
wrote in Syriac against the heresy (<I>ib.</I> iv. 30), as did Ephrem Syrus 
later.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1>Now, Marcion would seem to have travelled much and probably 
used his journeys to propagate his doctrines. Ephrem Syrus speaks of him as 
wandering like Cain, but possibly only refers to his leaving his country for 
Rome (Hymn 56, Assemani, <I>Bibl. Or.</I> i. 119). Tertullian constantly 
describes him as "nauclerus"; Rhodo (<I>ap.</I> Eus. v. 13) calls him <FONT 
face=symbol>nauthV</FONT>, according to a reading which we believe to be right, 
though the word is wanting in some MSS. His travels seem more likely to have 
preceded than to have followed his settling in Rome under Anicetus. Unless, 
therefore, the story of the interview with the Roman presbyters is to be 
rejected altogether, we think it must be taken date and all. The interview must 
be placed immediately after the death of Hyginus and we must suppose Marcion 
then to have left Rome on his travels and only to have settled there permanently 
some years later, first as a member of Cerdo's school and afterwards as his 
successor.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.1>The authorities as to the chronology of his life are very 
conflicting. The statement on which we can most rely is that he taught in Rome 
during the episcopate of Anicetus. We have no good warrant to extend his 
activity later, for we can give no credit to Tertullian when he names Eleutherus 
(<I>de Praesc.</I> 30) in connexion with the excommunication of Marcion. If 
Marcion did not survive Anicetus he may have been born <I>c.</I> 100. The 
<I>Chronicle</I> of Edessa names 138 for the beginning of Marcionism, and with 
this agrees the first year of Antoninus given by the Fihrist (Flügel's 
<I>Mani</I>, p. 85). This date is not improbable, if we suppose an Oriental 
preaching of the heresy to have preceded its establishment at Rome; A.D. 150 is 
a not unlikely date for Justin Martyr's <I>Apology</I>, and 12 years' growth is 
not too much for Marcionism to attain the formidable dimensions that work 
indicates. If Justin Martyr's work is dated earlier, the date of Marcionism will 
be similarly affected.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.2>The time of Marcion's death is unknown, but he probably 
did not survive Anicetus. The only works he is known to have left are his 
recensions of the Gospel and Pauline Epistles; his <I>Antitheses</I>, in which 
by comparing different passages he tried to shew that the O.T. contradicted the 
New, and also itself; and Tertullian refers to a letter of his, then extant, as 
proving that he had originally belonged to the Catholic church (<I>adv. 
Marc.</I> i. 1; iv. 4; <I>de Carn. Christ.</I> ii.). We learn from Rhodo (Eus. 
v. 13) that after his death his followers broke up into sects, among the leaders 
of which he names Apelles, who only acknowledged one first principle; Potitus 
and Basilicus, who counted two; and Syneros, who counted three (<I>Ref.</I> vii. 
31). Other Marcionite teachers mentioned are Prepo, an Assyrian, by Hippolytus, 
Lucanus by Tertullian; Pitho and Blastus (the latter probably erroneously) by 
Theodoret (<I>Haer. Fab.</I> i. 25). Epiphanius says (<I>de Mens. et Pond.</I> 
17) that Theodotion, the translator of O.T., had been a Marcionite before his 
apostasy to Judaism, and Jerome (<I>de Vir. Illust.</I> 56) states that 
Ambrosius was one before his conversion by Origen. These sectaries were 
formidable to the church, both from their numbers and the strictness of their 
life. They were very severe ascetics, refusing flesh meat, wine, and the married 
life. Unlike some Gnostics who taught that it was no sin to escape persecution 
by disguising their faith, the Marcionites vied with the orthodox<PB id=Page_695

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>in producing martyrs. Eusebius tells (iv. 15) that the 
same letter of the church of Smyrna from which he drew his account of the 
martyrdom of Polycarp, told also of the martyrdom of a Marcionite presbyter, 
Metrodorus, who, like Polycarp, suffered at Smyrna by fire, and in the same 
persecution. When, later, the Montanists appealed in proof of their orthodoxy to 
the number of their martyrs, they were reminded that this could be equally 
pleaded for the Marcionites (Eus. v. 16). Other Marcionite martyrs mentioned by 
Eusebius are a woman who suffered under Valerian at Caesarea in Palestine (iii. 
12), and a Marcionite bp. Asclepius, who in the Diocletian persecution was 
burned alive at Caesarea on the same pyre as the orthodox Apselamus (<I>Mart. 
Pal.</I> c. 10). The strictness of the Marcionite discipline is proved by the 
unfriendly testimony of Tertullian, who tries by their practice to convict of 
falsity the Marcionite theory, that a good God could not be the object of fear: 
"If so, why do you not take your fill of the enjoyments of this life? Why do you 
not frequent the circus, the arena, and the theatre? Why do you not boil over 
with every kind of lust? When the censer is handed you, and you are asked to 
offer a few grains of incense, why not deny your faith ? 'God forbid!' you 
cry--'God forbid!'"</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.3>At the end of the Diocletian persecution the Marcionites 
had a short interval of freedom of worship. An inscription has been found over 
the doorway of a house in a Syrian village (Le Bas and Waddington, 
<I>Inscriptions</I>, No. 2558, vol. iii. p. 583) bearing a Syrian date 
corresponding to the year commencing Oct. 1, 318. This is more ancient than any 
dated inscription belonging to a Catholic church. With the complete triumph of 
Christianity, Marcionite freedom of worship was lost. Constantine (Eus. <I>de 
Vit. Const.</I> iii. 64) absolutely forbade their meeting for worship in public 
or private buildings. Their churches were to be given to the Catholics; any 
private houses used for schismatical worship to be confiscated. But the dying 
out of Marcionism was probably less the result of imperial legislation than of 
the absorption of the older heresy by the new wave of Oriental dualism which in 
Manicheism passed over the church. The Theodosian Code (xvi. tit. v. 65) 
contains a solitary mention of Marcionites. They were not extinct in the fifth 
cent., for Theodoret, writing to pope Leo (<I>Ep.</I> 113, p. 1190), boasts that 
he had himself converted more than a thousand Marcionites. In <I>Ep.</I> 145 the 
number of converts rises to ten thousand; in <I>Ep.</I> 81 they are said to be 
the inhabitants of eight villages. In his Church History (v.) Theodoret tells of 
an unsuccessful effort made by Chrysostom for their conversion. Probably this 
survival of Marcionism was but a local peculiarity. But as late as 692 the 
council in Trullo thought it worth while to make provision for the 
reconciliation of Marcionites, and there is other evidence of lingering remains 
so late as the 10th cent. (Flügel's <I>Mani</I>, pp. 160, 167).</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.4><I>Doctrine.</I>--There is a striking difference of 
character between the teaching of Marcion and of others commonly classed with 
him as Gnostics. The systems of the latter often contain so many elements 
derived from heathenism, or drawn from the fancy of the speculators, that we 
feel as if we had scarcely any common ground with them; but with Marcion 
Christianity is plainly the starting-point, and the character of his system 
harmonizes with his being the son of a Christian bishop and brought up as a 
Christian. But he has been perplexed by the question of the origin of evil, and 
is disposed to accept the solution, much prevalent in the East then, that evil 
is inextricably mixed up with matter, which therefore could not be the creation 
of the Supreme. He tries to fit in this solution with his Christian creed and 
with the Scriptures; but naturally only by a mutilation of both can he force an 
agreement. Indeed, he sometimes has even to alter the text, <I>e.g.</I> "I am 
not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil," into "I am not come to fulfil the 
law, but to destroy." Still, the arbitrary criticism of Marcion has more points 
of contact with modern thought than the baseless assumptions of other Gnostics. 
A modern divine would turn away from the dreams of Valentinianism in silent 
contempt; but he could not refuse to discuss the question raised by Marcion, 
whether there is such opposition between different parts of what he regards as 
the word of God, that all cannot come from the same author.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.5>The fundamental point of difference between Marcion and 
the church was concerning the unity of the first principle. Marcion plainly 
asserted the existence of two Gods, a good one and a just one. What he meant to 
convey by these words Beausobre well illustrates by a passage of Bardesanes, 
preserved by Eusebius (<I>Praep. Evan.</I> vi. 10). He says that animals are of 
three kinds: some, like serpents and scorpions, will hurt those who have given 
them no provocation; some, like sheep, will not attempt to return evil for evil; 
others will hurt those only that hurt them. These three may be called evil, 
good, and just respectively. Marcion then thought the infliction of punishment 
inconsistent with perfect goodness, and would only concede the title of just to 
the God of O.T., who had distinctly threatened to punish the wicked. The God, he 
said, whose law was "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," was a just 
God, but not the same as that good God whose command was, "If any smite thee on 
the one cheek, turn to him the other also." The command, "Thou shalt love him 
that loveth thee and hate thine enemy" was that of a just God; "Love thine 
enemy" was the law of the good God. Further, the God of O.T. had said of 
Himself, "I create evil"; but since from a good tree evil fruit cannot spring, 
it follows that He who created evil cannot Himself be good. He could not be the 
Supreme, for He was of limited intelligence, not being able to find Adam when he 
hid himself, and obliged to ask, "Where are thou?", and also obliged to come 
down to see before He could know whether Sodom had done according to its cry. 
Marcion's theory was that the visible creation was the work of the just God; the 
good God, whose abode he places in the third or highest heaven and whom 
apparently he acknowledged as the creator of a high immaterial universe, neither 
concerned Himself with<PB id=Page_696 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y"

on the misery to which they had been brought by disobedience to their Creator 
who was casting them into his hell, He interfered for their redemption. The 
Marcionite denial of the unity of the first principle was variously modified. 
Some counted three first principles instead of two: a good Being who rules over 
the Christians, a just one over the Jews, a wicked one over the heathen. Others, 
since the world was supposed to be made out of previously existent matter, held 
that matter was a fourth self-originated principle. Marcion himself only counted 
two <FONT face=symbol>arcai</FONT>, but used the word in the sense of ruling 
powers, for it does not appear that he regarded matter as the creation either of 
his good or his just God, and therefore it should rightly have been reckoned as 
an independent principle. Tertullian, indeed, argues that Marcion, to be 
consistent, should count as many as nine gods. In all these systems the good 
Being was acknowledged to be superior to the others, so it was not a violent 
change to assume that from this principle the others were derived; and Apelles 
and his school drew near the orthodox and taught that there was but one 
self-originated principle. The ascription of creation and redemption to 
different beings enabled the church writers to convict the Marcionite deity of 
unwarrantable interference with what did not belong to him. This interference 
was the more startling from its suddenness, for Marcion's rejection of O.T. 
obliged him to deny that there had been any intimation of the coming redemption, 
or any sign that it had been contemplated beforehand. His God then suddenly 
wakes up to trouble himself about this earth; stoops down from his third heaven 
into a world about which, for thousands of years, he had given himself no 
concern; there kidnaps the sons and servants of another, and teaches them to 
hate and despise their father and their king, on whose gifts they must still 
depend for sustenance, and who furnishes the very ground on which this new God's 
worshippers are to kneel, the heaven to which they are to stretch out their 
hands, the water in which they are baptized, the very eucharistic food for which 
a God must be thanked to whom it had never belonged.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.6>Marcion's rejection of O.T. prophecy did not involve a 
denial that the prophets had foretold the coming of a Christ; but the Christ of 
the prophets could not be our Christ. The former was to come for the deliverance 
of the Jewish people; the latter for that of the whole human race. The former 
was to be a warrior--Christ was a man of peace; Christ suffered on the 
cross--the law pronounced accursed him that hangeth on a tree; the Christ of the 
prophets is to rule the nations with a rod of iron, kings are to set themselves 
against Him, He is to have the heathen for His inheritance and to set up a 
kingdom that shall not be destroyed. Jesus did none of these things, therefore 
the Christ of the prophets is still to come. Tertullian successfully shews that 
if Jesus was not the Christ of the prophets, He must have wished to personate 
Him, coming as He did at the time and in the place which the prophets had 
foretold, and fulfilling so many of the indications they had given. What Marcion 
supposed his own Christ to be has been disputed. Some have supposed that he did 
not distinguish him from his good God, for Marcion's Gospel was said to have 
commenced: "In the 15th year of Tiberius God came down to Capernaum, a city of 
Galilee, and taught on the Sabbath days" (Tert. <I>adv. Marc.</I> iv. 7); but we 
believe the true reading here is "eum," not "deum," and that Marcion held his 
Christ to be a saving Spirit (i. 19), but did not confound him with the Supreme. 
Marcion's Gospel told nothing of the birth of Christ, and Marcion's "came down" 
has a very different meaning from what it has in the original passage (Luke vi. 
31), in Marcion's use meaning "came down from heaven." In fact, the story of 
Christ's birth would represent Him as a born subject of the Demiurge, deriving 
from his bounty the very body in which He came; so it was preferred to tell the 
improbable tale of a divine teacher unheard-of before making a sudden appearance 
in the synagogue. That Christ had a real earthly body Marcion of course could 
not admit. See Docetism for an 
account of Marcion's doctrine on this subject, and that of his disciple Apelles, 
who on this point as on others approached more nearly to the orthodox. It was an 
obvious argument against the Docetic theory that if our Lord's body were not 
real we could have no faith that His miracles were real, nor in the reality of 
His sufferings and death, which Marcion was willing to regard as an exhibition 
of redeeming love; nor in the reality of His resurrection. Marcion, like the 
orthodox, taught that the death of our Lord was followed by a "descent into 
hell"; but Irenaeus tells us that he taught that there Cain, the people of 
Sodom, and others condemned in O.T. as wicked, received Christ's preaching and 
were taken up by Him into His kingdom; but that Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, the 
prophets, and other righteous men imagined that the Demiurge was tempting them 
as on other occasions, and so, being afraid to join themselves to Christ and 
accept deliverance from Him, were left in the underworld. Christ's salvation, 
according to Marcion, affected the soul only, and did not affect the body, of 
which he held there would be no resurrection. Indeed, none of those who regarded 
matter as essentially evil could believe that evil would be made eternal by a 
material resurrection. Tertullian points out that sin originates with the soul, 
not the body, and pronounces it unfair that the sinful soul should be redeemed 
and the less guilty body punished. On unredeemed souls no punishment would be 
inflicted by Marcion's good God--he would merely abandon them to the vengeance 
of the Demiurge; but Tertullian shewed that if direct punishment were 
inconsistent with perfect goodness, such abandonment must be equally so.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.9>The Marcionite system as described by Esnig has more of a 
mythic than of a rationalistic character, and if we accept this as the original 
form of Marcionism, Marcion owed more to the older Gnostics than we should 
otherwise have supposed. Marcion is said by Esnig to have taught that there were 
three heavens: in the highest dwelt the good God,<PB id=Page_697 thmlized="Y"

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>in the second the God of the Law, in the lowest His 
angels; beneath lay Hyle, or matter, having an independent existence of its own. 
By the help of Hyle, which played the part of a female principle, the God of the 
Law made this world, after which he retired to his heaven; and each ruled in his 
own domain, he in heaven and Hyle on earth. Afterwards the God of the Law, 
beholding how goodly this earth was, desired to make man to inhabit it, and for 
this purpose requested the co-operation of Hyle. She supplied the dust from 
which man's body was made, and he breathed in his spirit, and made him live. He 
named him Adam, gave him a wife, and placed him in Paradise. There they lived, 
honouring and obeying their Maker, in joy and childlike innocence, for as yet 
they had no children. Then the Lord of Creation, seeing that Adam was worthy to 
serve Him, devised how he might withdraw him from Hyle and unite him to himself. 
He took him aside, and said, "Adam, I am God, and beside me there is no other; 
if thou worshippest any other God thou shalt die the death." When Adam heard of 
death he was afraid, and gradually withdrew himself from Hyle. When Hyle came 
after her wont to serve him, Adam did not listen to her, but withdrew himself. 
Then Hyle, recognizing that the Lord of Creation had supplanted her, said, 
"Seeing that he hates me and keeps not his compact with me, I will make a number 
of gods and fill the world with them, so that they who seek the true God shall 
not be able to find him." Thus she filled the world with idolatry; men ceased to 
adore the Lord of Creation, for Hyle had drawn them all to herself. Then was the 
Creator full of wrath; and as men died he cast them into hell, both Adam, on 
account of the tree, and the rest. There they remained 29 centuries. At length 
the good God looked down from the highest heaven and beheld what misery men 
suffered from Hyle and the Creator. He took compassion on those plagued and 
tortured in the fire of hell, and he sent his son to deliver them. "Go down," he 
said, "take on thee the form of a servant, and make thyself like the sons of the 
law. Heal their wounds, give sight to their blind, bring their dead to life, 
perform without reward the greatest miracles of healing; then will the God of 
the Law be jealous, and will instigate his servants to crucify thee. Then go 
down to hell, which will open her mouth to receive thee, supposing thee to be 
one of the dead. Then liberate the captives whom thou shalt find there, and 
bring them up to me." This was done. Hell was deceived and admitted Jesus, who 
emptied it of all the spirits therein and carried them up to his Father. When 
the God of the Law saw this he was enraged, rent his clothes, tore the curtain 
of his palace, darkened his sun, and veiled his world in darkness. After that, 
Jesus came down a second time, but now in the glory of his divinity, to plead 
with the God of the Law. When the Creator saw Jesus thus appear, he was obliged 
to own that he had been wrong in thinking that there was no other god but 
himself. Then Jesus said, "I have a controversy with thee, but I will take no 
other judge between us than thine own law. Is it not written in thy law that 
whoso killeth another shall himself be killed; that whoso sheddeth innocent 
blood shall have his own blood shed? Let me, then, kill thee and shed thy blood, 
for I was innocent and thou hast shed my blood." Then he recounted what benefits 
he had bestowed on the Creator's children, and in return had been crucified; and 
the Creator could make no defence, seeing himself condemned by his own law, and 
he said: "I was ignorant; I thought thee but a man, and did not know thee to be 
a God; take the revenge which is thy due." Then Jesus left him and betook 
himself to Paul, and revealed to him the way in which we should go. All who 
believe in Christ will give themselves to this good and righteous man. Men must 
withdraw themselves from the dominion of Hyle; but all do not know how this is 
to be done.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.10>Though this mythical story differs much in complexion 
from other ancient accounts of Marcionite doctrine, we cannot absolutely reject 
it; for there is nothing in it inconsistent with Marcion's known doctrines or 
such as a Gnostic of his age might have taught. It is, indeed, such a system as 
he might have learned from the Syriac Gnostic Cerdo. But Marcion must have given 
the mythic element little prominence, or it would not have so disappeared from 
the other accounts.</P>
<P id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.11><I>Discipline and Worship</I>.--In rites Marcion 
followed the church model. Thus (Tert. <I>adv. Marc.</I> i. 14) he had baptism 
with water, anointing with oil, a mixture of milk and honey was given to the 
newly baptized, and sacramental bread represented the Saviour's Body. Wine was 
absent from his Eucharist, for his principles entirely forbade wine or flesh 
meat. [E<SMALL id=iii.xiii.ii.p1.13>NCRATITES</SMALL>.] Fish, 
however, he permitted. He commanded his disciples to fast on Saturday, to mark 
his hostility to the God of the Jews, who had made that His day of rest. 
Marriage he condemned. A married man was received as a catechumen, but not 
admitted to baptism until he had agreed to separate from his wife (<I>ib.</I> i. 
29 and iv. 10). This probably explains the statement of Epiphanius that the 
Marcionites celebrated the mysteries in the presence of unbaptized persons. The 
sect could not have flourished if it discouraged married persons from joining 
it; and if it admitted them only as catechumens, that class would naturally be 
granted larger privileges than in the Catholic church. <A class=Note 
href="http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.xiii.ii.htm#_fnf2" 
name=_fnb2><SUP class=Note>2</SUP></A> Nor need we disbelieve the statement of 
Epiphanius that a second or a third baptism was permitted. If a member married, 
or one who had put away his wife took her back, it is not incredible that on 
repentance a second baptism was necessary before restoration to full privileges 
of membership. Again, since the baptism of a married person was only permitted 
<I>in articulo mortis</I>, it would sometimes happen that catechumens were 
surprised by death before baptism, and it is not incredible that in such cases 
the device of a vicarious baptism may have been resorted to, as Chrysostom tells 
in speaking on the passage in Corinthians about being baptized for the dead. 
Epiphanius states that Marcion permitted
females to baptize. The Marcionite
baptism was not recognized by the church.
Theodoret tells that he baptized those whom
be converted. (See also Basil. 


<I>Can. 47, E¢.
</I>


199.) He tells also that he had met an aged
Marcionite who, in his hostility to the Creator,
refused to use his works, a principle which
could not possibly be carried out consistently.

<I>Canon </I>


of 


Scripture.-Marcion&#39;s rejection of
the O.T. involved the rejection of great part of
the New, which bears witness to the Old. He
only retained the Gospel of St. Luke (and
that in a mutilated form), and ten Epp. of
St. Paul, omitting the pastoral epistles. In
defence of his rejection of other apostolic
writings, he appealed to the statements of St.
Paul in Galatians, that some of the older
apostles had not walked uprightly after the
truth of the gospel, and that certain false
apostles had perverted the gospel of Christ.
Marcion&#39;s Gospel, though substantially identical, as far as it went, with our St. Luke&#39;s, did
not bear that Evangelist&#39;s name. That it
was, however, an abridgment of St. Luke was
asserted by all the Fathers from Irenaeus and
not doubted until modern times. Then it was
noticed that in some cases where Marcion is
accused by Epiphanius or Tertullian of having
corrupted the text, his readings are witnessed
by other ancient authorities. We have the
means of restoring Marcion&#39;s Gospel with
sufficient exactness. Tertullian goes through
it in minute detail; Epiphanius also has made
a series of minute notes on Marcion&#39;s corruptions of the text; some notices are also found
in the Dialogue of Adamantius. Combining
these independent sources, we obtain results
on which we can place great confidence. It
clearly appears that Marcion&#39;s Gospel and our
St. Luke&#39;s in the main followed the same order
and were even in verbal agreement, except
that the latter contains much not found in the
former. So that the affinity of the two forms
is certain, and the only choice is whether we
shall regard the one as a mutilation or the
other as an interpolated form. The theory
that the shorter form was the original was for
some time defended by Ritschl and Baur, who,
however, were obliged to yield to the arguments of Hilgenfeld and Volkmar. In Volkmar&#39;s 


<I>Das Evangelium Marcions the </I>


differences between the two forms of the Gospel are
examined in minute detail, especially with
reference to their doctrinal bearings ; and it
is found that the only theory which will
explain the facts is that Marcion&#39;s is a mutilated form. His form exhibits a hostility to
Judaism, the Mosaic law, and the work of the
Creator, of which there is not a trace in
genuine Pauline Christianity. Dr. Sanday


<I>(Gospel in the Second Cent., p. 204) </I>


has made
a careful linguistic, comparison of the portion
of our St. Luke which Marcion acknowledges
with that which he omits, the result being a
decisive proof of common authorship; the part
omitted by Marcion abounding in all the peculiarities which distinguish the style of the
third evangelist. The theory, therefore, that
Marcion&#39;s form is the original may be said to
be now completely exploded. 


Dr. 


Sanday
notes further that the text of St. Luke used
by Marcion has some readings recognized by
some other ancient authorities, but which no

</P>


<P>


critic now accepts. The inference is that
when Marcion used St. Luke&#39;s Gospel it had
been so long in existence, and had been copied
so often, that different types of text had had
time to establish themselves. It has been
argued that Marcion could not have known
our Fourth Gospel, else he would have preferred this, as being more strongly antiJewish. But the Fourth Gospel is not antiJewish in Marcion&#39;s sense, and he would have
had even more trouble in mutilating it to
make it serve his purpose. At the very outset
Christ&#39;s relation to the Jewish people is described in the words, " He came unto His
own " ; the Jewish temple is called His
Father&#39;s house; salvation is said to be of the
Jews; contrary to Marcion&#39;s teaching, Christ
is perpetually identified with the Christ predicted in O.T. ; the Scriptures are " they
which testify of Me," " Moses wrote of Me,"
" Had ye believed Moses ye would have believed Me." Great importance is attached
to the testimony of John the Baptist, who,
according to Marcion, like the older prophets,
did not know the true Christ ; and the miracle
of turning water into wine would alone have
condemned the Gospel in Marcion&#39;s eyes. In
short, the Fourth Gospel is strongly antiMarcionite. See esp. Zahn&#39;s 


<I>Gesch. des N.T.
Kanons, i. 587-718 </I>


and ii. 


<I>409-529.</I>

</P>
 
Marcion&#39;s 


<I>Apostolicon </I>


consisted of ten
epistles, in the order: Gal., I. and II. Con, Rom.
(wanting the last two chapters), I. and I I. Thess.,
Eph. (called by Marcion the Ep. to the Lao
diceans), Col., Philippians, Philemon. Con
cerning the order of the last two, Tertullian
and Epiphanius differ. The Acts and the
pastoral epistles are rejected. The Apostolicon was known to Jerome, who notes two or
three of its readings. The most careful
attempt to restore it is by Hilgenfeld 


<I>(Zeit
</I>


<I>schyift f. histoy. Theol. 1855). </I>


It becomes
apparent that Marcion struck out from the
Epistles which he acknowledged some passages
which conflicted with his theory and also made
some few additions. The arbitrary character
of such criticism would destroy all claim to
originality for Marcion&#39;s text of the Gospel,
even if that claim had not otherwise been
sufficiently refuted.</p>
