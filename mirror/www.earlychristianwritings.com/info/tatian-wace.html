<P>
<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1"><b>Tatianus (1)</b> the "Apologist," "born in the
land of Assyria" (<i>Oratio</i>, c. xlii.), <i>i.e.</i> E. of the
Tigris, in a land incorporated, under Trajan,
with Mesopotamia and Armenia into one
Roman province of Syria (Zahn, <i>Forsch. z.
Gesch. d. N.T. lichen Kanons</i>; I. Theil,
"Tatian&#39;s Diatessaron," p.268). Of his parents,
date of birth (<i>c.</i> 110, Zahn; <i>c.</i> 120, Funk), and
early training, little or nothing is known. In
Syria were Greek official representatives of
Rome, merchants, and residents. Among such,
stationed in the Assyrian district, may have
been the parents of Tatian; persons perhaps
of birth and wealth (cf. <i>Oratio</i>, c. xi.). The lad,
Semitic as regards the land of his birth, but
possibly Greek by parentage and name, was
educated in the Greek teaching open to him
(<i>Oratio</i>, c. xlii.). As he grew older his inquiring
mind led him to a personal examination of
the systems of his teachers (c. xxxv.). A
peripatetic by disposition if not in philosophy,
he "wandered over many lands, learning from
no man," but with eyes open and ears unstopped,
listening, observing, hearing, pondering,
until he abandoned the learning that had
made him a pessimist, and became a teacher
of that "Word of God" which had taught
him a holier faith and a happier life (cc. xxvi.
xlii.). He notes that the simplicity of style
of Holy Scripture first attracted and then
converted him (c. xxix.). The "barbaric [<i>i.e.</i>
Christian] writings," upon which he stumbled
by chance, charmed him by their modest
diction and easy naturalness. He soon discovered
that these writings were older than
the oldest remains of Greek literature, and in
their prophecies and precepts diviner and
truer than the oracles and practices of the
most powerful gods or the purest philosophers.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1.1">Tatian&#39;s information about himself ceases
with the autobiographical allusions and statements
in the <i>Oratio</i>. According to Irenaeus (<i>adv. Haer.</i>
i. c. 28; cf. Eus. <i>H. E.</i> iv. 29) he was a hearer
(<font face="symbol">akroathV</font>) of Justin Martyr;
and the <i>Oratio</i> indicates that he and the "most
admirable" Justin were at Rome together,
and were both exposed to the hostility of the
Cynic Crescens (cc. xviii. xix.).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1.2">Tatian&#39;s Christian life, like that of Tertullian,
divides into pre-heretical and heretical
periods. So long as Justin was alive, says
Irenaeus, he brought out no "blasphemy";
after his death it was different.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1.3">The testimony of his pupil Rhodon (Eus.
<i>H. E.</i> v. 13) leaves the impression that Tatian
for some time after Justin&#39;s death worked and
taught at Rome, busying himself with his "book of questions"
(<font face="symbol">problhmatwn biblion</font>),
dealing with what was "hidden and obscure
in the sacred writings" (<i>i.e.</i> of O.T.).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1.4">The chronology of his literary career is more
or less connected with the martyrdom of
Justin <i>c.</i> 163-167. Many critics consider
Justin&#39;s <i>Apology</i> and the <i>Oratio</i> to have been
composed about the same time (cf. Zahn, p.
279; Harnack, <i>Texte u. Untersuch. z. Gesch. d.
altchrist. Lit.</i> i. p. 196), <i>i.e.</i> A.D. 150-153.
Others place the <i>Oratio</i> after the death of
Justin (Lightfoot in <i>Contemp. Rev.</i> May, 1877;
Hilgenfeld, <i>Ketzergeschichte</i>, p. 395; Funk, <i>Zur
Chronol. Tatian&#39;s</i> in T&uuml;bingen <i>Theol. Quartalschrift</i>
for 1833, p. 219, etc.). The difference
in opinion turns very much upon the estimate
formed of a passage in Eusebius (<i>H. E.</i> iv. 16).
A similar want of unanimity prevails as to the
place of composition of the <i>Oratio.</i> Harnack
(pp. 198-199) argues from its language that it
was not written at Rome, where Zahn (p. 280) places it.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1.5">A. <i>The Oratio</i>.--The <i>Oratio</i>, by which he is
best known, belongs to that part of Tatian&#39;s
the most interesting and difficult of the Greek
apologetic writings. The title, 
<font face="symbol">Tatianou proV</font>
&#39;<font face="symbol">Ellhnas</font>,
terse and abrupt, is characteristic of
life which is reckoned orthodox. It is one of
the treatise. Tatian did not care for style.
Christianity was not, in his opinion, dependent
upon it. It was absent from the Scriptures
which had fascinated him; it belonged to the
Greek culture he had left behind. Yet he at
times shews himself no novice in the art he
condemned. C. xi. is a noble piece of declamation;
c. xix. a scathing denunciation of the
false, passing into a grave appeal in behalf of
the true. He can draw word-pictures, <i>e.g.</i>
those of the actor (c. xxii.), the wealthy patron
of the arena (<i>ib.</i>), and the Cynic philosopher
(c. xxv.), which are as clever and life-like as
those of Tertullian. The <i>Oratio</i> has two
principal divisions introduced by a preface (cc.
i.-iv.). Div. i. states the Christian doctrines
and their intrinsic excellence and superiority
to heathen opinions (cc. v.-xxx.); div. ii. demonstrates
their superior antiquity (cc. xxxi.-xli.);
the whole closes with a few words
autobiographical in character (c. xlii.).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p1.6">Tatian opens (c. i.) by deprecating as unreasonable
the contemptuous animosity of the
Greeks towards "Barbarians," and points out
that there was no practice or custom current
among them which they did not owe to
"Barbarians." Oneirology, astrology, auguries
from birds or sacrifices had come to them
from external sources. To Babylonia they
owed astronomy, to Persia magic, to Egypt
geometry, to Phoenicia instruction by letters.
Orpheus had taught them poetry, song, and
initiation into the mysteries, the Tuscans
sculpture, the Egyptians history, rustic
Phrygians the harmony of the shepherd&#39;s pipe,
Tyrrhenians the trumpet, the Cyclopes the
smith&#39;s art, and Atossa, queen of the Persians,
the method of joining letter-tablets (see Otto&#39;s
note). They should not boast of their excellent
diction when they imported into it "barbaric"
expression and maintained no uniformity
of pronunciation. Of Doric, Attic,
Aeolian, Ionian, which was the real Greek?
Further, let them not boast while they used
rhetoric to subserve injustice and sycophancy,
poetry to depict battles, the amours of gods,
and the corruption of the soul.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2">C. v., one of the most important (doctrinally)

and difficult in the <i>Oratio</i>, opens thus:</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.1">"In the beginning was God. We have been
taught that the beginning is the power of the
Logos. For the Lord of all, being Himself the substance
(<font face="symbol">upostasiV</font>) of all, in so far that
creation had not yet taken place, was alone;
but in so far as He was Himself all power, and
the substance of things visible and invisible,
all things were with Him: (and thus) with Him by Logos-power
(<font face="symbol">dia logichV dunamewV</font>),
the very Logos Himself, Who was in Him, subsisted
(<font face="symbol">upesthse</font>). By the simple will of
God the Logos springs forth, and not proceeding forth without cause
(<font face="symbol">kata kenou</font>), becomes
the first-begotten work of the Father. Him
we recognize as the beginning of the world.
He was born by participation, not by scission
(<font face="symbol">kata merismon ou kata apokophv</font>);
for He Who proceeds by scission is separated from
the first, but He Who has proceeded by participation
and has accepted a part in the administration of the world 
(<font face="symbol">to . . , oikonomiaV thn airesin
proslabon</font>), hath not rendered
Him defective from Whom He was taken.
Just as many fires are lighted from one torch,
but the light of the first torch is not lessened
through the kindling of the many, so the Logos
coming forth from the power of the Father
hath not made Him Who begat Him without Logos
(<font face="symbol">alogon</font>)."</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.2">Tatian upholds the belief in the resurrection
of the body at the end of all things. His
argument is briefly: "There was a time
when I did not exist: I was born and came
into existence. There will be a time when
(through death) I shall not exist; but again
I shall exist, just as before I was not, but was
afterwards born [cf. Tertull. <i>Apol.</i> xlviii.].
Let fire destroy my flesh, let me be drowned,
or torn to pieces by wild beasts, I am laid up
in the treasure-chambers of a wealthy Lord.
God Who reigneth can, when He will, restore
to its pristine state that which is visible to
Him alone." In c. vii. Tatian returns to the
Logos, that he may demonstrate His work as
regards angels and men.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.3">The thoughts of the better land and of God&#39;s
revelation by the prophets lead Tatian to
God&#39;s revelation of Himself in the Incarnation.
That doctrine he treats in a manner likely to
be admitted by a Greek, if very differently
from the way (<i>e.g.</i>) Justin Martyr presented
it to the Jews. We are not mad, he says (c.
xxi.), nor do we utter idle tales when we say that God was made
(<font face="symbol">gegonenai</font>) in the form of
man. The mythology of the Greeks was full
of such appearances--an Athene taking the
form of a Deiphobus, a Phoebus that of a
herdsman, etc., etc. Further, what did so
frequent an expression as the origin of the
gods imply but that they were mortal? The
difficulty attendant upon the heathen belief
was not removed by the tendency to resolve
all myths and gods into allegory. Metrodorus
of Lampsacus, in his treatise on Homer, invited
men to believe that the Hera or Athene
or Zeus, to whom they consecrated enclosures
and groves, were simply natural beings or
elemental arrangements. That, argues Tatian,
was to surrender their divinity; a surrender
he freely endorses, for he will not admit
any comparison between the Christian God and
deities who "wallow in matter and mud."</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.4">Tatian (c. xxii.) lashes with ridicule the
teaching offered to and accepted by the
Greeks, the teaching of the theatre and arena.
It might be urged that such places were frequented
and delighted in by the uncultured
only. Tatian therefore places the philosophers
also at the bar of judgment, and his contempt
for their teaching is only equalled by his ridicule
of their appearance (c. xxv.). He
denounces them as tuft-hunters and gluttons,
to whom philosophy was simply a means of
getting money. No two of them agreed.
One followed the teaching of Plato, a disciple
of Epicurus opposed him. The scholar of
Democritus reviled the pupil of Aristotle.
Why, protests Tatian, do you who are so
inharmonious fight us Christians who are at
least harmonious? "Your philosophers
maintain that God has a body: I maintain
that He is without a body; that the world
shall be often consumed by fire, I once for
all; that Minos and Rhadamanthus will be
the judges of mankind, I God Himself (cf. c.
vi.); that the soul alone is immortal, I the
body together with the soul." We, he continues,
do but follow the Logos of God, why
do you hate us? We are not eaters of human
flesh; the charge is false. It is among you
that Pelops the beloved of Poseidon is made a
banquet for the gods, that Saturn devours his
own children, and Zeus swallows Metis.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.5">After all, the philosophers do but make a
boast of language taken from others (c. xxvi.),
like the jackdaw strutting about in borrowed
plumes. The reading of their books is like
struggling through a labyrinth, the readers
must be like the pierced cask of the Danaids.
Why should they affirm that wisdom was with
them only? The grammarians were at the
bottom of all this folly; and philosophers
who parcelled out wisdom to this and that
system-maker knew not God and did but
destroy each other. "Therefore," Tatian
concludes scornfully, "you are all nothing--blind
men talking with deaf; handling
builder&#39;s tools but not knowing how to build;
preaching but not practising ; swaggering
about in public but hiding your teaching in
corners. We have left you because this is
your character. We can have nothing more
to do with your instructions. We follow the word of God."</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.6">Tatian then explains (c. xxix.) how he became
a Christian. It was not through want
of knowledge of what he was leaving. He had
been initiated into the (Eleusinian) mysteries,
and had made trial of every kind of religious
worship. The result had sickened him. Among
the Romans he had found the Latiarian Jupiter
delighting in human gore, Diana Aricina
similarly worshipped, and this or that demon
systematically urging on to what was evil.
He withdrew to seek by some means to discover
the truth. "As," he says, "I was
earnestly considering this I came across certain
barbarian writings, older in point of antiquity
than the doctrines of the Greeks, and far too
divine to be marked by their errors. What
persuaded me in these books was the simplicity
of the language, the inartificial style of the
writers, the noble explanation of creation, the
predictions of the future, the excellence of
the precepts, and the assertion of the government
of all by One Being. My soul being thus
taught of God I understand how the writings
of the Gentiles lead to condemnation, but the
sacred Scriptures to freedom from this world&#39;s
slavery, liberating us from thousands of
tyrants, and giving us, not indeed what we
had not received, but what we had once received
but had lost through error."</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.7">Tatian, with all the energy of a convert,
loudly proclaimed the truth which satisfied
him. He goes on to shew (cc. xxxi.-xli.) that
the Christian religion was a "philosophy" far
more ancient than that of the Greeks. He
compares Homer and Moses, "the one the
oldest of poets and historians, the other
the founder of our barbarian widom." The
comparison proves the Christian tenets older
than those of the Greeks, and even than the
invention of letters. After enumerating
numerous variant opinions as to the date,
parentage, and poetry of Homer, he remarks
upon such discordant testimony as proving
the history untrue; so different from the
unanimity common among Christians. "We
reject everything," he says, "which rests
upon human opinion; we obey the commandments
of God and follow the law of the Father
of immortality. The rich among us follow
philosophy, and our poor are taught gratuitously.
We receive all who wish to be taught,
aged women and striplings: every age is
respected by us. . . . We do not test them by
their looks, nor judge them by their outward
appearance. In body they may be weak, but
in mind they are strong. . . . What we do keep
at a distance is licentiousness and falsehood."
His mention of the women who received
Christian instruction leads him to a digression
in defence of them. The Gentiles scoffed, he
says, at them, and alleged that the Christians
talked nonsense among them. Tatian retorts
(cc. xxxiii. xxxiv.) by pointing to the disgrace
the Greeks cast upon themselves, not only by
their unbecoming conduct to women generally,
but by the statues they erected to courtesans
and wanton poetesses. "All our
women," bursts forth Tatian, "are chaste;
and our maidens at their distaffs sing nobler
songs about God than a Sappho." The
Greeks should repudiate the lesson of immorality
which their statues had immortalized and
the foul practices inculcated by indecent
writers, and turn to Christianity which enjoined
truth and purity of thought and life.
"I do not," says Tatian (c. xxxv.), "speak of
these things as having merely heard about
them. I have travelled much; I have
studied your philosophy (<i>al.</i> rhetoric, cf. Eus.
<i>H. E.</i> iv. 16, and Otto&#39;s note here), and your
arts and inventions. At Rome I saw the
multitude of statues you have collected there.
And, as the result, I have turned from Roman
boastfulness, Athenian exaggeration, ill-connected
doctrines, to the barbaric Christian philosophy."</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.8">He now returns to the subject started in c.
xxxi., after one word in deprecation of the
sneer at himself: "Tatian, the man so
superior to the Greeks, so superior to the
numberless teachers of philosophy, has
opened up a new vein of learning--the doctrines
of the barbarians!" Whether Homer
was contemporary with the Trojan war, or a
soldier under Agamemnon, or even lived before
the invention of letters, Moses yet lived
long before either the building or taking of
Troy. In proof of this, Tatian appeals to the
Chaldeans, Phoenicians, and Egyptians. <i>E.g.</i>
Berosus, the Babylonian historian, "a most
competent authority," spoke of the wars of
Nebuchadnezzar against the Phoenicians and
Jews which happened 70 years before the
Persian rule, and long after the age of Moses.
Phoenician historians, such as Theodotus,
Hypsicrates, and Mochus had referred to
events connected with Hiram of Tyre, whose
date was somewhere about the Trojan war.
Both Solomon and Hiram lived long after
Moses. The Egyptians were noted for the
accuracy of their chronicles, and Ptolemy, the
priest of Mendes, spoke of the departure of
the Jews from Egypt as having taken place under
the leadership of Moses under king Amosis.
This king, according to him, lived in the time
of the Argive king, Inachus, after whose reign,
dating 20 generations, the taking of Troy was
reached. Therefore, if Moses was a contemporary
of Inachus, he lived some 400 years
before the Trojan war. It was not till after
the time of Inachus that the most illustrious
deeds of gods and men in Greece were committed
to writing and became known. Such
records, therefore, were far less ancient than
the time of Moses. Tatian sums up (c. xl.)
by affirming it self-evident that Moses was of
far greater antiquity than the ancient heroes,
wars, or gods (demons). Men ought, therefore,
to believe the more ancient authority in
preference to the Greeks, who had borrowed
from Moses, as from a spring, without acknowledgment
(<i>al.</i> unconsciously); and in many
cases had perverted what they took. Moses
was, moreover, older than all the writers
before Homer, <i>e.g.</i> than Linus, the teacher of
Hercules, who lived in the generation before
the Trojan war, than Orpheus, who was a
contemporary with Hercules, and than the
wisest of the wise men of Greece, <i>e.g.</i> Minos--so
famous for his wisdom, shrewdness, and
legislative powers--who lived in the 11th
generation after Inachus; Lycurgus, the
Lacedemonian lawgiver, who was born long
after the taking of Troy; Draco, Solon,
Pythagoras, and those seven wise men, the
oldest of whom lived about the 50th of those
Olympiads which began about 400 years after the taking of Troy.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.9">The treatise is a defence of Christianity
rather than of Christians, and not so much a
defence of doctrines as an answer or oration
to those who sneered at them. He depicts
Christianity as contrasting by its goodness,
wisdom, and truth with the heathenism
which revelled in vice, foolishness, and error.
Unlike other apologists, there is little care to
discuss Thyestean banquets (cf. c. xxv.), or
refute want of patriotism (c. iv.) His
weapons are weapons of offence rather than
of defence. In Tatian "barbaric (<i>i.e.</i> Christian)
philosophy "dares to carry the war into
the enemy&#39;s camp, and scorn is turned upon
the scorners. It is a typical specimen of the
class to which the <i>lrrisio Gentilium Philosophorum</i> of 
H<small id="iii.xx.ii.p2.11">ERMIAS</small>
also belongs.</p>
<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.12"><i>The Opinions of Tatian.</i>--(<i>a</i>) <i>God</i> (see c.
iv.).--With Tatian, as with Justin, God, not
contemplated as He is in His nature but as
revealed in His works, is the starting-point of
all Christian philosophy. Tatian&#39;s doctrine
about the creation is in c. v. In the creation itself he recognizes
two stages (c. ii.): (<font face="symbol">a</font>) matter,
shapeless and unformed, is put forth
(<font face="symbol">probeblhmenh</font>)  by God; and
(<font face="symbol">b</font>) the world,
separated from this matter, is fashioned into
what is full of beauty and order, though
eventually to be dissolved by fire (c. xxv.).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.13">(<i>b</i>) <i>The Logos</i> (see c. v.).--The relation between
God (<font face="symbol">o despothV</font>) and the Logos Who
subsists in Him, the Hypostasis, is conceived
from a different point of view, and set forth
in different terms from those of Justin. With Tatian the Logos springs
forth (<font face="symbol">prophda</font>) by
the Will of God. The process of begetting,
the relationships of Father and Son, and the
worship due to the Son, are not brought
forward. The inward communion between
them which carries with it these truths is
indeed expressed by the deep phrase <font face="symbol">sun
autv dia logikhV dunamewV autoV kai o logoV</font>;
but the outward exhibition of this communion--the
"springing forth"--is suggestive of emanation
rather than of begetting. The distinction between the
<font face="symbol">logoV endiaqetoV</font> and the
<font face="symbol">logoV proforikoV</font>,
so strongly expressed by the apologist Theophilus (ii. 10), is more
than visible. Tatian, in fact, presents the
Logos as the personification of an abstraction.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.14">(<i>c</i>) <i>The Holy Spirit</i> is evidently with Tatian
a distinct personal Being. He does not, as
Justin (<i>Apol.</i> i. 60), speak directly of His share
in the creation; he rather leads up to His work
and office as "the Minister of the suffering
God" (c. xiii.), when he would present its
bearing upon the nature of man. Starting
from the initial positions, "God is Spirit," and
the Logos "a Spirit born of the Father," Tatian recognizes two
varieties of Spirit: (<font face="symbol">a</font>)
"the spirit which pervades matter, inferior to
(<font face="symbol">b</font>) the more Divine Spirit" (c. iv.). To
the Spirit is attributed prophetic powers.
Abiding with the just and locked in the embrace of the soul 
(<font face="symbol">sumblekomenon th yuch</font>),
He proclaims to other souls by means of prophecies
that which is concealed. He uses the
Prophets as His organ (cf. c. xx.). This action
Tatian has also attributed to "the Power of the
Logos" (c. vii.). Perhaps, as with Justin, this title of the Logos,
<font face="symbol">h dunamiV</font>, defines for Tatian
the meaning of the <font face="symbol">pneuma</font>
(cf. <scripRef passage="II. Cor. iii. 17" id="iii.xx.ii.p2.15">II. Cor. iii. 17</scripRef>).
The Spirit is the Divine Power of the Logos.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.16">(<i>d</i>) <i>Angelology and Demonology.</i>--Of good
angels Tatian says nothing; but he speaks as
strongly as Justin of evil angels, though he
presents their work and ways in different
language and (in some respects) from a
different point of view. When expelled from
heaven the fallen angels or demons lived with
animals. Some of these they placed--the
dog, the bear, the scorpion, etc.--in the heavens
as objects of worship. Of demons, Tatian
recognizes two classes. Receiving alike their
constitution from matter, and possessing the
spirit which comes from it, few only turned
to what was purer, the many chose what was
licentious and gluttonous (c. xii.); they became
the very "effulgences of matter and
wickedness" (c. xv.). Though material, none
of the demons possess flesh; their structure
is spiritual like that of fire or air (<i>ib.</i>).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.17">(<i>e</i>) <i>Man.</i>--Tatian recognizes the three parts
of body, soul, and spirit. At the fall man lost
the spirit or highest nature, which had in it
immortality (c. vii.). As the angels were cast
down from heaven, so man was driven forth
from earth, "yet not out of this earth, but
from a more excellent order of things than
exists here now." Tatian would seem to
place Paradise above our earth; he describes
it (c. xx.) as one of the better aeons unaffected
by that change of seasons which is productive
of various diseases, as partaking of a perfect
temperature, as possessing endless day and
light, and as unapproachable by mortals such
as we are. Man, though deprived of the
spirit, must aim at recovering his former
state. Body and soul are left him. The soul
is composite: it is the bond of the flesh; yet
also that which encloses the soul is the flesh.
The soul cannot appear without a body, nor
can the flesh rise again without the soul.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.18">Faith is a necessity for knowledge of divine things;
<font face="symbol">o pisteuwn epignwsetai</font> (c. xix.); faith
and knowledge together help towards the
victory over sin and death. Men, after the throwing away
(<font face="symbol">apobolhn</font>) of immortality;
have conquered death by the death which is
through faith (cf. c. xi.: "Die to the world!
Live to God!"); and through repentance a
call has been granted to those who (according
to God&#39;s word) are but a little lower than the
angels (c. xv.). Through faith, and as the
object of faith, Tatian proclaims that "God
was born in the form of a man" (c. xxi.), and speaks of
the Holy Spirit as the minister of the God Who hath suffered
(<font face="symbol">ton diakonon tou peponqotoV qeou</font>,
c. xiii.). If he never mentions
the names Jesus or Christ, it is because
the facts of the Incarnation and Passion would
commend themselves independently of names
to Gentiles, to whom such facts were illustrated
by their mythology (cf. Justin, <i>Apol.</i> i.
21). Faith animates the famous passage on
the soul (c. xiii.), and especially in connexion
with the resurrection. "We have faith in this
doctrine," he exclaims (c. v.); but he does
not rest his reasons on the resurrection of
Christ (as St. Paul), but on an argument which
may have suggested the more elaborate
reasoning of Tertullian (<i>Apol.</i> c. xlviii.):
There was a time when as man he was not;
after a former state of nothingness he was
born. Again, there would be a time when he
would die; and again there would be a time
when he should exist again. There was nothing
of metempsychosis or transmigration of
souls in his conception. Though the flesh
were destroyed by fire or wild beasts, or dispersed
through rivers or seas, "I," says
Tatian, "am laid up in the storehouses of a
wealthy Lord. God the King will, when He
pleases, restore to its former state my substance
which is visible to Himself alone" (c. vi.).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.19">As regards free will, Tatian uses even more
emphatic language than Justin (e.g. <i>Apol.</i> i.
43). He opposes the Scriptural (and Platonic)
belief in free will to the fatalism of philosophers
(cc. viii.-x.), and while he pours scorn upon
their views, pens a touching appeal to them
as men "not created to die" (see c. xl. end).
<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.20"><i>Christian Practice.</i>--Though Tatian does not
speak of his co-religionists as Christians, but
accepts willingly the contemptuous expression
"barbarians," it is the doctrines of Christ
which alone have, in his opinion, raised them
above a world deluded by the trickeries of
frenzied demons (c. xii.), and wallowing in
matter and mud (c. xxi.). Where the old
nature has been laid aside, men have not only
apprehended God (c. xi.), but through a
knowledge of the True One have remodelled
(<font face="symbol">metarruqmizein</font>) their lives (c. v.). Holy
baptism and membership in the church did
not enter into his argument. A passing allusion
to the Holy Eucharist perhaps underlies
his indignant protest against the frequent
defamation that Christians indulged in Thyestean
banquets (c. xxv.). He seems to prefer
advancing the great help which the Scriptures
had been to himself, and might be to his
philosophical opponents. "Barbaric" though
these Scriptures were, they were in the O.T.
portion both older and more divine, more full
of humility and of deep knowledge, more
marked by excellence and unity than any
writings claimed by the Greeks (c. xxix.).
These "divine writings" made men "lovers
of God" (c. xii.); and men thus God-taught
were helped by them to break down the
slavery in the world, and gain back what they
had once received, but had lost through the
deceit of their spiritual foes (c. xxix.).</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p2.21">The O.T. seems to have greatly attracted
Tatian. It probably formed the basis of the lost work
<font face="symbol">problhmatwn biblion</font> mentioned by
Rhodon; and in his attempt to collect and
solve O.T. difficulties, Tatian was among the
first, if not the first, of Christian commentators.
The <i>Oratio</i> shews that he knew well the
Gospels, Acts, and Pauline Epistles. If
reference to 0. and N. T. is more marked by
allusion than by direct quotation, the cause
is the well-known practice of the apologists,
who usually abstain from such quotations
when writing to Gentiles who would have
allowed little authority to them. Tatian&#39;s
references to St. John&#39;s Gospel are, however,
both exceptional and indisputable, and testify
to a widespread knowledge of that Gospel at
the period in question. Independently of coincidences
of exposition, three passages may be specified:</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3">Of these the second is prefaced by
<font face="symbol">to eirhmenon</font>,
the expression which in N.T. introduces the Scriptures (cf.
Luke ii. 24; Acts ii. 16, xiii. 40; Rom. iv. 18).
The third passage is punctuated by Tatian in the manner invariably
followed by the early Christian writers
(contrast the <i>textus receptus</i>,
<font face="symbol">oude en o gegonen</font>).
The coincidence is, as noted by Bp. Lightfoot,
remarkable, for the words are extremely simple
in themselves. Their order and adaptation
give uniqueness to the expression.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3.2">B. <i>The Diatessaron.</i>--(1) <i>History.</i>--The
history of the recovery of this work is
sufficiently romantic. In the literature of
the Western church there is no serviceable
testimony to it till the middle of 6th cent.;
in the Eastern church Eusebius (+ 339-340)
is the only Greek writer of the first four
cents. who gives any information about it.
It was apparently (see <i>Codex Fuldensis</i>, ed.
Ranke, 1868, ix. 1) mere chance which put
into the hands of bp. Victor of Capua (+ 554)
a Latin book of the Gospels without title or
author&#39;s name, but evidently compiled from
the four canonical books. This unknown
work excited his interest; and searching in
vain the Latin Christian literature of the past,
he turned to the Greek, and found in Eusebius
two notices of Harmonies. (<i>a</i>) In the letter
to Carpianus the harmony of Ammonius of
Alexandria (3rd cent.) was described. Its
principle was that of comparison. The Gospel
of St. Matthew was followed continuously, and
the passages--and only those--from the other
Gospels which tallied with the text of St.
Matthew were referred to or inserted in the
margin or in parallel columns. This excluded
the greater part of. St. John&#39;s Gospel and
much of St. Luke&#39;s. The <i>Harmony</i> was for
private use, not for the public service of the
church. Whether or not the descriptive title given to it in
Eusebius--<font face="symbol">to dia tessarwn
euaggelion</font>--was that of the church historian
or of Ammonius remains undetermined. (<i>b</i>) In
his Church History (iv. 29, 6), Eusebius refers
to Tatian as having composed a "sort of
connexion or compilation, I know not how,
of the Gospels, and called it the <i>Diatessaron</i>"
(<font face="symbol">sunafeian tina kai sunagwghn ouk oid</font>&#39;
<font face="symbol">opwV tvn euaggeliwn sunqeiV</font>.)
Cf. Bp. Lightfoot in <i>Contemp Rev.</i> May 1877; Zahn, i. pp. 14,
15); and he adds that this work was current in his
day. Its principle was amalgamation, not
comparison. Victor came to the conclusion
that his unknown work was substantially the
<i>Diatessaron</i> of Tatian. This acute verdict--purged
of some unimportant errors (see Lightfoot,
<i>l.c.</i>; Zahn, i. pp. 2, 3)--has survived the
difficulties which a comparison of the <i>Codex Fuldensis</i>
with the <i>Diatessaron</i> at first presented.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3.3">A notice in the treatise on Heresies, written
in 453 by Theodoret (+ 457-458), bp. of Cyrrhus
on the Euphrates, is the first definite evidence
to the <i>Diatessaron</i> after the time of Eusebius.
The identification of it by Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i>
xlvi. 1) with the Gospel according to the
Hebrews is an earlier testimony in point of
date (Epiphanius + 403), but is connected with
a blunder which, though capable of explanation,
somewhat disqualifies the evidence.
Testimony to the <i>Diatessaron</i> comes rather
from the Syriac-speaking church of the East
than from the Greek. Theodoret says of
Tatian: "He composed the Gospel which is
called <i>Diatessaron</i>, cutting out the genealogies
and such other passages as shew the Lord to
have been born of the seed of David after the
flesh. This work was in use not only among
persons belonging to his sect, but also among
those who follow the apostolic doctrine, as
they did not perceive the mischief of the
composition, but used the book in all simplicity
on account of its brevity. And I
myself found more than 200 such copies held
in respect in the churches in our parts. All
these I collected and put away, and I replaced
them by the Gospels of the four Evangelists"
(i. 20. Cf. Lightfoot, <i>l.c.</i>; Zahn, i. p. 35).
This passage indicates a considerable circulation
of the <i>Diatessaron</i> in the bishop&#39;s diocese
and neighbourhood. The language of that district
was Syriac (Zahn, i. pp. 39-44); therefore
the book to which Theodoret refers was in
Syriac and not Greek. This simple fact helps
to explain the language of Eusebius and the
blunder of Epiphanius; and is itself illustrated
by the fact that the commentary on the
<i>Diatessaron</i> was composed not by a Greek
writer, but by Ephrem the Syrian. Epiphanius&#39;s
statement that Tatian on leaving
Rome went into Mesopotamia, points to a
visit to Edessa, the only place in the district
where Christianity had secure footing (see
Zahn, i. p. 282 and Excursus ii.) and a city
famous for its schools. To the same Tatian
rumour assigned the <i>Diatessaron</i> which some
called "the Gospel according to the Hebrews."
How did Epiphanius confound two works so
essentially different? Zahn&#39;s explanation
seems perfectly satisfactory. The report
was current that there was a Syriac book of
the Gospels, called a <i>Diatessaron</i>, used in the
Syrian churches, <i>e.g.</i> those of the diocese of
Cyrrhus. Further, it was reported that there
was another book of the Gospels, written in
a kindred dialect and used <i>e.g.</i> at Beroea, <i>i.e.</i>
in the neighbourhood of Cyrrhus, by the half-heretical
Nazareans. An outsider like Epiphanius
might very easily confound them and
even identify them (i. p. 25. See Wace,
<i>Expositor</i> for 1882, p. 165). Eusebius had
not actually seen Tatian&#39;s <i>Diatessaron</i>. His
statement, "I know not how" Tatian composed
it, shews that he had not personally
examined it, doubtless because of non-acquaintance
or non-familiarity with Syriac.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3.4">Theodoret&#39;s language implies, moreover,
that the <i>Diatessaron</i> had been current in his
diocese for a very long period; and this is
confirmed by an examination of the commentary
of Ephrem Syrus (+ 378). Dionysius
bar Salibi, bp. of Amida in Armenia Major
(+ 1171 M&ouml;singer and Bickell, or 1207 Assemani
and Lightfoot, see Zahn, i. p. 98, n. 4), states in
the preface to his own commentary on St. Mark
(quoted in Assemani, <i>Bibl. Or.</i> i. 57, ii. 159;
see M&ouml;singer, p. iii.; Zahn, i. pp. 44, 99) that
Tatian, the pupil of Justin, made a selection
from the four Gospels (<i>al.</i> Evangelists), which
he wove together into one Gospel, and called
a <i>Diatessaron, i.e.</i> Miscellanies. This writing
St. Ephrem interpreted. Its opening words
were, "In the beginning was the Word." An
Armenian version (5th cent.) of Ephrem&#39;s
Commentary was printed at Venice in 1836,
but remained unserviceable until a MS. Latin
and literal translation of the Armenian made
by J. B. Aucher, one of the Mechitarist monks
of that city, together with one of the Armenian
codices, was placed in the hands of a Salzburg
professor, Dr. G. M&ouml;singer, who revised, corrected,
and published the Latin text at
Venice in 1876. Internal and external
evidence (see M&ouml;singer, pp. vi-x) combine in
justifying the conclusion that in this Latin
translation of the Commentary of Ephrem is
contained substantially Tatian&#39;s <i>Diatessaron</i>,
and that from it Tatian&#39;s text may be in a
great measure recovered.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3.5">The bearing of M&ouml;singer&#39;s translation upon
the corresponding portion of the <i>Codex Fuldensis</i>
may be briefly summarized. Dr. Wace
(<i>Expositor</i> for 1881, pp. 128 seq.) may be said
to have proved that Victor of Capua&#39;s <i>Harmony</i>
preserved in that Codex is not only very
closely allied with Tatian&#39;s <i>Diatessaron</i>, but
exhibits substantially the document on which
Ephrem commented with some occasional
alterations of order and few additions; the
difference being remembered that in Victor&#39;s
<i>Evangelium</i> Tatian has been transferred into
the Latin text of St. Jerome, whereas Ephrem
commented upon him in a Syriac translation.
The M&ouml;singer text and the Codex proceed <i>pari
passu</i>, and agree in order where that order is
certainly remarkable. The very interesting fact
is thus established, that Tatian&#39;s <i>Diatessaron</i>
found acceptance in the West as well as the
East, and was transferred rather than translated
into a Western version. This is not
surprising. Theodoret&#39;s statement as to its
popularity in his diocese may well account for
its existence in a Latin form a century later.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3.6">It remains to indicate the manner in which
the Syriac <i>Diatessaron</i> passed into Latin form,
such as is preserved in the <i>Codex Fuldensis</i>
(Zahn, i. pp. 298-328) The interesting fact
comes out that this took place without the use
of any intermediary Greek <i>Diatessaron</i>. In
language and form the Latin <i>Harmony</i> is based
upon St. Jerome&#39;s version; and the differences
between the Codex and Tatian--such as
alterations in chronological rder, expansions
and abbreviations, coincidences and deviations--indicative
as they are of dependence
of the Codex upon Tatian, do not require the
explanation which an intermediate Greek text
would easily supply. The C<i>odex Fuldensis</i>
must be dated between 383 (when Jerome
put forward his revision of the translation of
the Gospels) and 546 (when Victor of Capua
wrote down the Latin <i>Harmony</i> preserved in
the Codex); or, more approximately, <i>c.</i> 500
(Zahn, i. p. 310). Translations from Syriac
into Greek existed in 4th cent. (Eus. <i>H. E.</i>
i. 13, iv. 30), and the fact--with its consequence,
a further translation from Greek into
Latin--might be quoted in proof of a more
early date than A.D. 500 for the <i>Codex Fuldensis</i>; but, independently of other reasons, the
age of Victor of Capua has yielded proofs of
direct translations from Syriac into Latin,
which render appeals to a Greek <i>Diatessaron</i>
unnecessary. Kihn (<i>Theodor von Mopsuestia
und Junilius Africanus</i>; see Zahn, i. p. 311)
has shewn that in the days of Victor of Capua,
J<small id="iii.xx.ii.p3.8">UNILIUS</small>,
<i>Quaestor sacri palatii</i> at Constantinople
(<i>c.</i> 545-552) sent to Primasius, bp. of
Adrumetum, a Latin introduction to the
Scriptures (<i>Instituta regularia divinae legis</i>)
which was a free rendering of a work written
(<i>c.</i> 533-544) by the Syrian Nestorian Paul, a
pupil and teacher of the school of Nisibis.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p3.9">(2) <i>Recovery of the Diatessaron.</i>--This is
due to the energetic scholarship of Zahn. By
the use principally of Ephrem&#39;s commentary
(ed. M&ouml;singer) and of the quotations in the
Homilies of Aphraates he has printed the text
(i. pp. 113-219) in detail; comparing it
throughout with the Syriac of Cureton (Sc.),
the Peshito (P.), and frequently the Philoxenian
text revised by Thomas of Harkel
(Hl.), with the Greek MSS. 

[need Aleph character here]

, B, and D, and
with Sabatier and Bianchini&#39;s editions of the
MSS. of the Itala. Verse by verse the text
is reconstructed and tabulated in sections.
Each section&#39; s accompanied by an exhaustive
critical and expository comment, and an index
to all the passages incorporated in the <i>Harmony</i>
enables the student to examine the evidence
respecting any individual verse. These
sections indicate the character of the <i>Harmony</i>
and may be seen as given by Zahn, with the
refs. to Ephrem omitted in favour of Eng.
headings in Fuller&#39;s <i>Harmony of the Gospels</i>
(S.P.C.K.). Zahn has pursued the subject
further in his <i>Forschungen zur Geschichte des
N.T. Kanons</i>, ii. 286-299, and his <i>Geschichte
des N.T. Kanons</i>, (1888) i. 1, 369-429; (1892),
ii. 2, 530-556.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p4">(3) <i>The Theological Opinions of Tatian.</i>--Until
the death of Justin Martyr he was
considered orthodox; after that heterodox.
The change can only be roughly sketched.
In the <i>Oratio</i> are found traces of the three
heretical views which Irenaeus attributed to
him. (i) The allusion to Aeons above the
heavens (c. xx.) may very well have led on to
theories akin to those of Valentinus (Iren.
<i>adv. Haer.</i> i. 28). (ii) The doctrine that the
protoplast lost the image and likeness of God
(cc. viii. xii. xv.) might lead to the denial of
the salvation of Adam (<i>ib.</i> iii. 23, § 8). (iii)
His allusion (c. xv.) to man as distinguished
from the brute--implying by contrast points
of resemblance between them--makes possible
a transition to the severer views of
denouncing marriage as defilement and fornication
as did Marclon and Saturninus (Iren.
c. xv.; Hieron. <i>Comm. l.c. in Ep. ad Gal.</i> vi.),
and also the use of meats (Hieron. <i>adv. Jovin.</i>
i. 3). Were the heretical writings in existence
which Irenaeus affirmed that Tatian had
written and he himself had read (Zahn, i. p.
281), we might be able to judge how far they
justified Irenaeus in describing him as "elated,
puffed up as if superior to other teachers, and
forming his own type of doctrine," and to
trace something of his erroneousness in
the <i>Problems</i>, and other lost works, <i>e.g.
Concerning Perfection according to the
Saviour</i>; and in the criticisms, paraphrases,
or translations of some of St Paul&#39;s
Epistles, which Eusebius (<i>H. E.</i> iv. 29) had
heard of, and which Jerome described as
repudiations of those apostolic writings (<i>Praef.
in Comm. to Titus</i>, see Zahn, i. p. 6, n. 4). A
few hints only are forthcoming on these
points, and these filtered through unfriendly
channels. But the general impression cannot
be resisted. Tatian became first suspected
and then denounced. He left Rome, possibly
pausing at Alexandria to teach, among his
pupils being Clement of Alexandria (cf.
Lightfoot, p. 1133; Zahn, i. p. 12), and then
proceeding to the East, to Mesopotamia (Epiphan. 
<i>Haer.</i> xlvi. i. Correct his error in
chronology by Lightfoot and Zahn, i. p. 282),
there to live until his death. It is more than
probable that on leaving Rome he carried
the <i>Diatessaron</i> with him, unpublished. In
the West he had become unacceptable. The
language of Irenaeus <i>c.</i> 185--</i>i.e.</i> probably after
Tatian&#39;s death--leaves no doubt upon this
point. Men honoured and valued the <i>Oratio</i>
(cf. <i>int. al.</i> Hilgenfeld, <i>Ketzergeschichte</i>, pp.
386, 387); but say nothing of the <i>Diatessaron</i>.
In the Greek-speaking churches of the East
the writer of the <i>Oratio</i> was not less valued
(cf. Eus. <i>H. E.</i> iv. 29, v. 28), and they speak
of the <i>Diatessaron</i>; but it is by report or at
second-hand only. Ugly rumours circulated.
Tatian, described broadly as "connexio
omnium haereticorum" (Iren. <i>adv. Haer.</i> iii. 23),
had become, in defiance of historical probability (Zahn, i. p.288), an
E<small id="iii.xx.ii.p4.2">NCRATITE</small>,
one whose tenets had spread into Asia Minor from
Antioch, and who blossomed out at last
into "Encratitarum acerrimus haeresiarches"
(Hieron.). Had Irenaeus, Eusebius, or Jerome
known the <i>Diatessaron</i>, would they not
have examined it as they had examined
Tatian&#39;s <i>Oratio</i> and other works? Would not
the very compilation of a <i>Diatessaron</i> have
been obnoxious to one who, like Irenaeus,
counted the fourfold Gospels (neither more,
nor less) an absolute necessity? But in the
Syriac-speaking East he was unknown, or not
followed by troublesome reflections upon his
orthodoxy, and there the teacher who was
eclectic rather than heterodox could produce
and circulate that work, which commended
itself to the "simplicity" of the churches
around Edessa "on account of its brevity,"
till Theodoret enlightened them.</p>

<p id="iii.xx.ii.p4.3">The date of his death is unknown, but if he
left Rome <i>c.</i> 172 or 173 he would have been
about 62 years of age, and, humanly speaking,
with time before him to circulate the <i>Diatessaron</i>
before he died.</p>

to Otto&#39;s ed. of the <i>Oratio</i> will be found
