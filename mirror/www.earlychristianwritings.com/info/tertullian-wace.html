<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1><B>Tertullianus (1), Quintus Septimius Florens.</B></P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.1>I. L<SMALL id=iii.xx.vi.p1.2>IFE</SMALL>.--The earliest of 
the great Latin Fathers, their chief in fire and daring, and the first to create 
a technical Christian Latinity, is known almost entirely through his writings. 
It can only be conjectured that he was born between A.D. 150 and 160, and died 
between 220 and 240, with preference for the later dates. He was born at 
Carthage (Hieron. <I>Catal. Script. Eccl.</I> 53; cf. Tertull. <I>Apol.</I> c. 
ix.) of heathen parents (<I>de Poen.</I> c. i.; <I>Apol.</I> c. xviii. "de 
vestris sumus"), his father being a proconsular centurion (Hieron.). Tertullian 
received a good education (<I>Apol.</I> c. xiv.; <I>adv. Prax.</I> c. iii.). In 
after-life he recalled his school studies in Homer (<I>ad Nat.</I> i. c. x.); 
but poetry attracted him less than philosophy, history, science, and antiquarian 
lore. He spoke and composed in Greek, but his Greek writings are lost. He 
studied the systems of the philosophers if he mocked and hated the men (cf. 
<I>de Anima</I>, cc. i.-iii.). Possibly destined for state-official life, he was 
celebrated for his knowledge of Roman law (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> ii. 2), and the 
legal fence and juridical style of the advocate are observable throughout his 
apologetic and polemical writings.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.3>He was probably attracted to Christianity by complex 
irresistible and converging forces: "Fiunt, non nascuntur Christiani" 
(<I>Apol.</I> c. xviii.). The constancy of the Christians in times of 
persecution staggered him. He knew men who began by denouncing such "obstinacy," 
and ended in embracing the belief which dictated it (<I>Apol.</I> c. l.; <I>ad 
Scap.</I> c. v.). Demons confessed the superiority of the new faith 
(<I>Apol.</I> c. xxiii.), and Tertullian, in common with his heathen and 
Christian contemporaries, was a profound believer in demons (cf. Reville, <I>La 
Religion à Rome sous les Sèvéres</I>, pp. 44, 46. 130 seq.). These facts led him 
to examine the faith which seemed to promise a foothold which no philosophical 
system furnished. It was illustrated by a life of holiness and humility--that of 
its Founder, the Just One--in contrast with which the life of the Cynic and the 
Stoic sickened him.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.4>His conversion took place <I>c.</I> 192, in Carthage more 
probably than in Rome. Carthage was his home and usual dwelling-place (<I>de 
Pallio</I>, c. i.; <I>Apol.</I> c. ix.; <I>Scorpiace</I>, c. vi.; <I>de Resur. 
Carnis</I>, c. xlii.); Rome he had visited (<I>de Cultu Femin.</I> i. c. vii.), 
and he was well known there for his abilities (Eus. <I>l.c.</I>), but critics 
are by no means agreed whether he ever went there as a Christian (cf. Baron. 
<I>Annal. Eccl.</I> ii. 476, ed. Theiner). He was married but childless (cf. the 
two treatises <I>ad Uxorem</I>), and became a priest of the church. He probably 
exercised his presbyterate at Carthage and not at Rome.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.5>In middle age (<I>c.</I> 119-203), says Jerome, Tertullian 
became a Montanist, his constitution and temperament predisposing him to a 
rigour opposed to the laxity prevalent at Rome, and so finding the austere 
doctrines and practices of Montanus perfectly congenial (Kaye, <I>Account of the 
Writings of Tertullian</I>,<SUP><SMALL id=iii.xx.vi.p1.6>3</SMALL></SUP> p. 34). 
He became the head of the Montanist party in Africa--a party which existed till 
the 5th cent. under the name of "Tertullianists."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.7>II. T<SMALL id=iii.xx.vi.p1.8>IMES</SMALL>.--The golden age 
of the empire died with Marcus Aurelius (161-180); the age of iron began with 
his son Commodus (180-193). The golden age of the church began with that iron 
age of the empire (Aubé, <I>Les Chrétiens dans l'empire romain</I>, A.D. 
180-249, pp. iii, 495-498). Expiring polytheism and ancient philosophy were 
confronted by a new philosophy and a nascent faith.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.9>From one quarter only of the empire was the comparative 
peacefulness noticeable elsewhere absent. In Africa persecution, sharp, short, 
fitful, and frequent, marked the reign of Septimius Severus and the most active 
period of Tertullian's life. It is stamped in letters of blood upon his 
pages.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.10>The church in Africa has no historian before Tertullian, 
though its foundation is placed, with much probability, at the end of cent. i. 
or the beginning of cent. ii. By the end of cent. ii. the Christians in Roman 
Africa were to be counted by thousands (cf. Aubé, p. 152) if not by millions 
(cf. <I>Apol.</I> c. xxxvii.; <I>ad Scapulam</I>, cc. ii. v.). They were fully 
organized and had their bishops, priests, deacons, places of assembly, and 
cemeteries. Immunity from the wholesale decimation which had befallen, by 
imperial command (cf. <I>Apol.</I> c. v.), other Christian bodies of the East 
and West, allowed in Africa growth and development, accelerated by occasional 
suffering and martyrdom. But the tempest broke upon the African church at 
last.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.11>Facts connected with the persecutions can be followed in 
those writings of Tertullian which all critics place between A.D. 197 and 212, 
from the <I>ad Martyres</I> to the <I>ad Scapulam</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.12>The tract <I>ad Martyres </I>depicts men and women in 
prison, visited and relieved by the brethren, exhorted to unity, and prepared by 
fasting and prayer for the death which should be a victory for the church. 
Vigellius Saturninus was the first proconsul to draw the sword against 
Christians (<I>ad Scapulam</I>, c. iii.), and his date is not apparently earlier 
than 198 (see Aubé, p. 191, etc.). The martyrology<PB id=Page_941 thmlized="Y"

Scillitan martyrs had died at Carthage (Görres, <I>Jahr. f. Prot. Theol.</I> 
1884, pts. ii. iii.); but after that there is a blank till 198, when Namphamo 
was the new "archimartyr" of the church. A few months' respite followed. It was 
disturbed by an event which is with some plausibility alleged to have taken 
place at Carthage. A certain soldier refused the <I>donativum</I> of Severus and 
Caracalla, publicly declined the laurel crown accepted by his fellow-soldiers, 
and proclaimed himself a Christian. The incident is described in the <I>de 
Corona</I>; Tertullian, making it a test case, debated whether the Christian 
could accept military service. His advice, and the conduct founded upon it, 
infuriated the heathen. Under Hilarian (202-203) persecution broke out again. It 
took the special form of refusing the Christian dead their usual place of 
burial; the cry invaded the proconsul's tribune, "Areae non sint!" ("No 
cemeteries for the Christians!"). Just then the decree issued in 202 by Severus 
indirectly if not directly gave sanction to all measures of repression. It 
forbad proselytizing by either Jew or Christian. It was easy, were the African 
proconsul so minded, to read into this purely prohibitive measure a licence to 
persecute. The "fight of martyrdom and the baptism of blood" which ensued is 
perhaps to be traced in Tertullian's <I>de Fuga</I> and <I>Scorpiace</I> 
(between 202-212). These treatises are fiercely scornful against the flight once 
counselled when persecution raged. The <I>de Fug</I>a (c. v.) denounces, not 
less angrily, a growing practice--purchase of immunity. Of sterner mould and of 
more loving faith were the brothers Satyrus and Saturninus, the slaves Revocatus 
and Felicitas, and the nobly born and nobly-wedded Perpetua. The Acts of their 
passion, by some (<I>e.g.</I> Bonwetsch and Salmon) attributed to Tertullian 
himself, have preserved a picture of the times--a reluctant proconsul, 
all-willing martyrs, and a scoffing crowd saluting their baptism of blood with 
the mocking cry, "Salvum lotum" (see the Acts in Migne's <I>Patr. Lat.</I> iii., 
and Aubé's collation, <I>op. cit.</I> pp. 221-224, 509, etc.).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.13>Again there came a respite, and again must the character 
of the proconsul have been instrumental in securing it. Of Julius Asper 
(proconsul in 205 or 206) it is told that not only did he refuse to force a 
Christian to sacrifice who under the torture had lapsed from the faith, but 
publicly expressed regret to his assessors and the advocates at having to deal 
with such cases (<I>ad Scapulam</I>, c. iv.). For five or six years persecution 
was stayed, years of literary activity on the part of Tertullian. In 211, for 
some unknown reason, the religious war broke out afresh, and its cruel if brief 
progress is told in the <I>ad Scapulam</I>. Tertullian's last "Apology" is 
worthy of the Christian gladiator. Stroke upon stroke he deals his ponderous 
blows against the proconsul. "We battle with your cruelty," he cries; but his 
weapons are the "offensive" weapons which Christ had put in his hands--prayer 
for the persecutors, love for enemies (Matt. v. 44). God's jugments, he warns 
them, were abroad. Drought, fires, eclipses, declared His wrath; the miserable 
deaths of persecuting proconsuls betokened it. "This our sect shall never fail," 
is his triumphant shout. "Strike it down, it will rise the more. We recompense 
to no man evil for evil, but we warn you--Fight not against God!"</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.14>In 212 the blessing of peace rested again upon Africa and 
continued for some years.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.15>III. W<SMALL 
id=iii.xx.vi.p1.16>RITINGS</SMALL>.--Tertullian's literary activity is by some 
confined to 197-212; by others, with far greater probability, it is extended to 
at least <I>c.</I> 223. A general chronological arrangement only is possible, 
the dates given being few and uncertain. The only work which supplies positive 
evidence of date is the first book <I>adv. Marcionem</I> (3rd ed.). In c. xv. 
Tertullian says he is writing in the 15th year of Severus, now considered to be 
A.D. 207 (Bonwetsch, <I>Die Schriften Tertullians nach der Zeit ihrer 
Abfassung</I>, p. 42). Tertullian was then a Montanist, but his pen had for some 
years been employed in behalf of the church.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p1.17>Tertullian's writings represent him variously as layman, 
priest, and schismatic; and divide broadly into works written in the Catholic or 
Montanist periods of his life. The latter must further be subdivided into 
treatises in which Catholic or schismatic elements are respectively prominent. 
In character they are threefold: (<I>a</I>) Apologetic; (<I>b</I>) Dogmatic and 
polemical; (<I>c</I>) Moral and ascetic. The arrangements of Bp. Kaye and 
Bonwetsch have in the main suggested that which follows; though the dates 
attached are in almost all cases conjectural.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p2>(1) Works written while still in the church: (<I>a</I>) 
Apologetic writings (<I>c.</I> 197-198): <I>ad Martyres; Apologeticum; de 
Testimonio Animae; ad Nationes</I>, i. ii; <I>adv. Judaeos</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p2.1>(<I>b</I>) Other works of this period, but of less certain 
date: <I>de Oratione; de Baptismo; de Poenitentia; de Spectaculis; de Cultu 
Feminarum</I>, i.; <I>de Idololatria; de Cultu Feminarum</I>, ii.; <I>de 
Patientia; ad Uxorem</I>, i. ii. (the last five <I>c.</I> 197-199); <I>de 
Praescriptione Haereticorum</I> (<I>c.</I> 199); <I>adv. Marcionem</I> i. (1st 
ed.), <I>c.</I> 200.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3>(2) Montanistic writings: --</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.1>(<I>a</I>) Defending the church and her teachings 
(<I>c.</I> 202-203): <I>de Corona; de Fuga in Persecutione; de Exhortatione 
Castitatis</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.2>(<I>b</I>) Defending the Paraclete and His discipline: 
<I>de Virginibus Velandis</I> (<I>c.</I> 203-204, a transition work); <I>adv. 
Marcion.</I> (2nd ed.; <I>c.</I> 206); <I>ib.</I> (3rd ed.; <I>c.</I> 207). 
Between 200-207 or later: <I>adv. Hermogenem; adv. Valentinianos; adv. 
Marcion.</I> (iv.); <I>de Carne Christi; de Resurrectione Carnis; adv. 
Marcion.</I> (v.). <I>De Pallio</I> and <I>de Anima</I> (<I>c.</I> 208-209); 
<I>Scorpiace</I> (<I>c.</I> 212; <I>al.</I> 203 or 204); <I>ad Scapulam</I>

were soldiers, "called to the military service of the living God" by a 
sacramental oath, to which they must be true. (2) They were Christian athletes 
whose prison was their training-school (<I>palaestra</I>), where "virtus duritia

Mucius, Heraclitus and Peregrinus, Dido and the wife of Hasdrubal, would teach 
them to count their sufferings trifling if, by enduring them, they might obtain 
a heavenly glory and a divine reward. In their own day many persons of birth, 
rank, and age had met their death at the hands of the emperor. Should Christians 
hesitate to suffer as much in the cause of God?</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.5><I>Apologeticum.</I>--This Apology--the greatest of his 
works--was a cry for bare justice.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.6>(1) A heading to c. i., "Quod religio Christiana damnanda 
non sit, nisi qualis sit prius intelligatur," sums up its protest: The rulers of 
Carthage were persecuting and condemning a "sect" which forthcoming evidence 
proved unworthy of condemnation. Their conduct was the reverse of that enjoined 
by the emperor Trajan--that Christians were not to be sought out; but if brought 
before Pliny were to be punished. Tertullian reminds the rulers (c. v.) that the 
laws against Christians had been enforced only by emperors whose memory men had 
learnt to execrate: <I>e.g.</I> Nero and Domitian. Not such as these was 
Tiberius (cf. Eus. <I>H. E.</I> ii. 2), in whose day Christ came into the world 
(cf. c. vii.), and who had desired the senate to admit Him among the Roman 
deities. Marcus Aurelius was a protector. Not even Hadrian, Vespasian, Pius, nor 
Verus had put into force the laws against Christians. The men who were demanding 
this were daily and contemptuously infringing laws of all kinds. In proof he 
draws a sad picture of luxury and immorality. The good old laws had gone which 
encouraged in women modesty and sobriety.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.7>(2) Chaps. vii.-ix. What were the charges against the 
Christians? "We are called miscreants"--and the evidence was only rumour! "Fama 
malum, quo non aliud velocius ullum." It was, Tertullian retorts, the existence 
(secret or open) of evil practices among the heathen which explained their 
belief in similar deeds among Christians.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.8>(3) Chaps. x.-xxvii. Tertullian faces the first of the two 
great charges, "sacrilege and treason." His "apology" as regards the former 
consists, briefly speaking, of (<I>a</I>) "demonstratio religionis eorum" (cc. 
x.-xvi. xxiv.-xxvii.) and of (<I>b</I>) "demonstratio religionis nostrae " (cc. 
xvii.-xxiii.), a most valuable <I>evidential</I> passage.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.9>(<I>a</I>) You Christians, said the heathen, do not worship 
our gods: No, said Tertullian, and we won't, because we do not recognize them to 
be gods. They were nothing but men of long ago, whose merits should have plunged 
them into the depths of Tartarus. How much better would it have been if the 
<I>deus deifus</I> had waited and taken up to heaven in their place such men as 
Socrates, Aristides, Themistocles, and others. The images excite Tertullian's 
intense scorn, as "the homes of hawks and mice and spiders." Caustically does he 
describe the heathen treatment of their household gods. "You pledge them, sell 
them, change them. They. wear out or get broken, and you turn your Saturn into a 
cooking-pot and your Minerva into a ladle! You put your national gods in a 
sale-catalogue; and the man who will sell you herbs in the herb-market will sell 
you gods at the Capitol. Or what could be more insulting than the company you 
give them? You worship Larentina, the prostitute, together with Juno or Ceres or 
Diana. You erect (at Rome) a statue to S<SMALL 
id=iii.xx.vi.p3.11>IMON</SMALL> M<SMALL id=iii.xx.vi.p3.12>AGUS</SMALL> and 
give him as inscription the title of <I>sanctus deus</I> (see Kaye's 
<I>Tertull.</I> p. 542, and Oehler's note here). You turn into a god a sodomite 
like Antinous" (see Kellner's note).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.13>What then, it was asked, did Christians worship if not the 
gods? Tertullian answers, "Take in this first of all: they who are not 
worshippers of a lie are worshippers of truth." From this might be deduced the 
whole of the Christian religious belief. But before Tertullian proceeds to do 
this, he refutes some very false, but common, opinions about the Christians, 
<I>e.g.</I> the vulgar belief that the god of the Christians was an ass's head, 
that they worshipped the cross, or the sun. Lately a <I>bestiarius</I> (see 
Semler's and Kellner's notes) had exhibited a picture at Rome inscribed <I>Deus 
Christianorum</I> <FONT face=symbol>onokoithV</FONT>. The figure had the ears of 
an ass, one foot was hoofed, in his hand was a book, and he was dressed in a 
toga (see <I>D. C. A. s.n.</I> "Asinarii"). The name and the form only made us 
laugh, says Tertullian; and then he retorts: "But our opponents might well have 
worshipped such a biformed deity: for they have dog-headed and lion-headed gods, 
gods with horns, gods with wings, gods goat-limbed, fish-limbed, or 
serpent-limbed from the loins!"</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.14>(<I>b</I>) Tertullian turns from what Christianity was not 
to what it was, and the main lines of the evidences of Christianity in the 2nd 
cent. are still those of our own. These chapters (xvii.-xxiii.), so valuable in 
the history of religious belief, deserve the student's close attention. The 
eloquence, fervour, humility, and devoutness of the writer will be felt to be 
contagious. Irony and passion are comparatively absent. The section details 
(<I>b</I><SUB id=iii.xx.vi.p3.15><FONT size=-3>1</FONT></SUB>) the nature and 
attributes of the Creator, (<I>b</I><SUB id=iii.xx.vi.p3.16><FONT

(<I>inundati</I>) the Holy Spirit, (<I>b</I><SUB id=iii.xx.vi.p3.17><FONT 
size=-3>3</FONT></SUB>) the character of the Scriptures, and (<I>b</I><SUB 
id=iii.xx.vi.p3.18><FONT size=-3>4</FONT></SUB>) the history of the Lord. Under 
<I>b</I><SUB id=iii.xx.vi.p3.19><FONT size=-3>3</FONT></SUB> Tertullian notes 
two things. These Scriptures were marked, first, by that <I>antiquity</I> which 
his opponents rightly valued. The most ancient heathen writings were far less 
ancient than those of Moses, the contemporary of the Argive Inachus, and (as 
some thought) 500 years older than Homer. Nay, the very last prophet was coeval 
with the first of the (heathen) philosophers, lawgivers, and historians. "Quod 
prius est, semen sit necesse est." Secondly, the Scriptures were marked by 
<I>majesty</I>. "Divinas probamus (<I>scripturas</I>), si dubitatur antiquas." 
This <I>internal</I> evidence was a proof of their antiquity, while the 
<I>external</I> and daily fulfilment of prophecy was a reason for expecting the 
verification of what was not yet fulfilled.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.20><I>b</I><SUB id=iii.xx.vi.p3.21><FONT 
size=-3>4</FONT></SUB> is in answer to the questions, Why did Jews and 
Christians differ? Did not these differences argue worship of different gods? 
Tertullian's reply (c. xxi.) is a history of the origin of the Christian sect 
and name, and an account of the Founder of Christianity, such as we have in the 
Gospels. His account is interspersed with most interesting statements,<PB

Christ that He was only man, and from His miraculous power that He was a 
magician, and not the Logos of God; the record of the darkening of the sun at 
the crucifixion preserved in the secret archives of the empire; the reason for 
the seclusion of the Lord after the resurrection, viz. "that the wicked should 
be freed from their error, and that faith destined for so glorious a reward 
should be established upon difficulty"; his own opinion that Caesars (such as 
Tiberius) would have believed in Christ, if they could have been Caesars and 
Christians at the same time; the sufferings of the disciples at the hands of the 
Jews; and at last, through Nero's cruelty, the sowing the seed of Christianity 
at Rome in their blood (cf. c. l.). He concludes:"Deum colimus per Christian." 
Count Him a mere man if you like. By Him and in Him God wishes to be known and 
worshipped.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.22>One more point remained. Romans considered their position 
as masters of the world the reward of their religious devotion to their gods, 
and affirmed that they who paid their gods the most service flourished the most. 
Tertullian traverses this "assumption" in ironical terms, or meets it with 
positive denial.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.23>(4) Chaps. xxviii.-xxxvi.--The charge <I>laesae 
augustioris majestatis</I> is now reached. The evil spirits stirred up the 
heathen to compel Christians to sacrifice <I>pro salute imperatoris</I>; and 
that compulsion was met by resistance not less determined. Ironically does 
Tertullian commend in the heathen the dread with which they regarded Caesar as 
more profound and reverential than that which they accorded to the Olympian 
Jupiter. Christians were counted <I>publici hostes</I>, because they would not 
pay to the emperor vain, lying, or unseemly honours; and because, as <I>verae 
religionis homines</I>, they kept the festival days not lasciviously, but as 
conscientious men. Truly if public joy was to be expressed by public shame, the 
Christians deserved condemnation.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.24>(5) Chaps. xxxvii.-xlv.--This section, dealing with minor 
points of objection to the Christians, opens with an impassioned protest on 
behalf of men who, actuated by the principle "Idem sumus imperatoribus qui et 
vicinis nostris," never took vengeance for the wrongs done to them. Mob-law had 
attacked them with stones and fire, or with Bacchanalian fury had torn their 
dead from the graves to rend their bodies asunder. Had Christianity tolerated 
repaying evil with evil, what secret vengeance could have been wrought in a 
single night with a torch or two! Or, had they determined to act as open 
enemies, what numbers and resources would they have had! "We are but of 
yesterday," is Tertullian's proud boast (cf. c. i.), "and yet we have filled 
your cities, fortresses, towns, assemblies, camp, palace, senate, and forum: 
<I>sola vobis reliquimus templa</I>. Should we determine to separate from you 
and betake ourselves to some remote corner of the globe, your loss of so many 
citizens would cover you with shame. The solitude, silence, and stupor as of a 
dead world would fill you with fear. You would have to seek subjects to govern. 
Your enemies would be more numerous than your citizens. At present it is your 
Christian citizens who make your enemies so few." Tertullian therefore asks that 
Christians should be admitted "inter licitas factiones." The "sect" was 
incapable of any such acts as were dreaded in forbidden societies. If they had 
indeed their own occupations (<I>negotia</I>), why should that give offence? For 
what were the "negotia Christianae factionis"? (c. xxxix.). Tertullian's answer 
is a touching picture of the simple Christendom of his day. "We are a body 
linked together by a common religious profession, by unity of discipline, and by 
a common hope. We meet as a congregation and pray to God in united supplication. 
<I>Haec vis Deo grata est</I>. We pray for the emperors, their ministers, and 
those in authority, for the welfare of the world, for peaceful times, and for 
the delaying of the end (see c. xxxii.). We come together to listen to our Holy 
Scriptures (cf .Just. Mart. <I>Apol.</I> ii.); and by holy words we nourish 
faith, raise hope, stablish confidence, and strengthen discipline. Our 
presidents are elders of approved character, who have obtained this honour not 
by purchase but by desert. On the monthly day appointed each gives to the chest 
what he likes; the money is disbursed not in feasting and drinking, but in 
supporting and burying the poor, in providing for destitute orphan boys and 
girls, in supporting the aged, the infirm, and the shipwrecked, and in 
succouring those sent to the mines or incarcerated in prisons <I>ex causa Dei 
sectae</I>."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.25>(6) Chaps. xlvi.-l.--Accusations had been met and the case 
of the Christian stated. What remained? One last perversion on the part of 
unbelief: "Christianity was no divine institution, but simply a kind of 
philosophy." The refutation of this closes the <I>Apology</I>. Tertullian, if 
frequently satirical, is at first grave and dignified, sober and patient, more 
than is his wont; but the smouldering fire bursts out at last; his last chapter 
is a climax of withering scorn and impassioned appeal.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.26><I>Ad Nationes</I> (i. ii.) is practically a short form of 
the <I>Apology</I>. It covers the same ground, uses the same arguments and 
largely the same language. But the <I>Apology</I> was addressed to the rulers 
and magistrates of Carthage, this to the people. Its whole cast is consequently 
more popular, its arguments less prolonged, its illustrations less reserved (cf. 
I. cc. iv. viii. xvi.; II. c. xi.).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.27><I>De Testimonio Animae</I> was written very soon after 
the <I>Apology</I>, to which it refers (c. v.). Some have thought it the most 
original and acute of his works (see Neander, <I>Antignosticus</I>, p. 259). 
Many of his predecessors, says Tertullian (c. i.), had ransacked heathen 
literature to discover in it support of the Christian efforts to expel error and 
admit equity. The attempt was, in his opinion, a mistake and a failure. He would 
not repeat it. Neither would he adduce Christian writings when dealing with 
heathen, for nobody consulted them unless already a Christian. Therefore he 
turns to another and a new testimony, that of the soul. Apostrophizing it, he 
cries, "Thou art not, so far as I know, Christian. The soul is not born 
Christian [cf. <I>Apol.</I> xviii.], but becomes Christian. Yet Christians beg 
now for a testimony from thee, as from one outside<PB id=Page_944 thmlized="Y"

may blush for their hatred and mockery of us." The testimony of the soul to God 
is found in popular phrases indicative of knowledge and fear of God; then it is 
adjured to speak about immortality and the resurrection of the body (c. iv.; cf. 
<I>Apol.</I> xlviii.).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.28><I>Adversus Judaeos</I>.--The authenticity and integrity 
of the treatise, as usually printed, have both been disputed; the latter with 
justice, the former needlessly, and principally on account of the discredit 
attaching to the latter portion. Chaps. i.-viii. are certainly Tertullian's, 
written while still a churchman. The latter chapters are different, both in 
character and style. The treatise was occasioned by a dispute between a 
Christian and a heathen converted, not to Christianity but to Judaism. 
Practically, the question between them was the exclusion or not of Gentiles from 
the promises of God. But there was a preliminary question. Was any one expected, 
and if expected, had any one come, "novae legislator, sabbati spiritalis cultor, 
sacrificiorum aeternorum antistes, regni aeterni aeternus dominator," or was His 
advent still matter of hope? (c. vii.). The fulfilment of prophecy rightly 
understood was the answer. Tertullian does not need to prove that the Christ 
should come. Every Jew believed and hoped it. Is. xlv. 1 was sufficient proof of 
it. (He renders the passage differently from the present Hebrew text, and with 
one especially interesting variation, reading, "Thus saith the Lord God to my 
Christ the Lord (<FONT face=symbol>Kuriw</FONT>)," etc., instead of "to Cyrus 
(<FONT face=symbol>Kurw</FONT>) His anointed," etc. So also in <I>adv. Prax.</I> 
cc. xi. xxviii.] In the then fulfilment of this prophecy he sees the proof that 
the Christ had come. Upon whom but upon Christ had the nations 
believed?--nations such as (<I>int. al.</I>) Moors, Spaniards, Gauls, Britons, 
"inhabiting places inaccessible to the Romans but subjugated to Christ" (in the 
same chapter he speaks of them as "shut up within the circuit of their own 
seas"), Germans and others, unknown to him, and too numerous to mention. Christ 
reigned everywhere, was adored everywhere: "omnibus aequalis, omnibus rex, 
omnibus judex, omnibus Deus et Dominus est."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.29>B. <I>Tertullian the Priest.</I>--Tertullian had hitherto 
written as a layman. The writings now to be considered indicate more or less 
directly that he had become a priest (cf. <I>de Baptismo</I>, cc. xvii. xviii.). 
Persecution was for a time suspended. It is highly probable that about this time 
a synod of African bishops met at Carthage to discuss matters affecting the 
organization, discipline, and teaching of the church; and the occasion may have 
been used to ordain one who, as an "apologist," had proved himself so fearless a 
champion of the church. Questions concerning heretical baptism, and the attitude 
of the church towards the heretical sects, were very probably discussed, and 
Tertullian's lost treatise on heretical baptism was written in Greek to 
circulate the synod's decisions beyond the confines of the African church.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.30>Other points, however, dealing with Christian life and 
ethics, came before him in his work in Carthage as a priest. The flock looked to 
their pastors for guidance: prayer, baptism, repentance, and the discipline 
connected with them; woman's dress and woman's life, married or unmarried; 
pleasures, amusements, how far lawful or unlawful,--all were matters upon which 
direction was desirable, and to all does Tertullian apply himself. Roughly 
divided, the treatises were practical and doctrinal, but the division must not 
be pressed too closely.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.31>(1) <I>Practical Treatises.--De Oratione.</I> (<I>a</I>) 
Of the Lord's Prayer specifically (cc. i.-xi.); (<I>b</I>) of prayer 
generally--times, places, and customs (cc. xii.-end).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.32>(<I>a</I>) As Christ was Spirit, Word, and Reason, so His 
prayer was formed of three parts: the word by which it was expressed, the spirit 
by which alone it had power, the reason by which it was appropriated (the 
reading is disputed); and the practice of prayer was recommended with three 
injunctions: that it should be offered up in secret, marked by modesty of 
faith," and distinguished by brevity. It was in very truth "breviarium totius 
evangelii." It is reckoned as containing seven clauses, the doxology not being 
given; and each clause is considered separately. The comments are reflections 
rather than interpretations; and if unequal and sometimes fanciful, they are 
very beautiful and can never be read without profit. His own summary (c. ix.) is 
a mine of spiritual thought. He approves of other prayers being used 
corresponding with the special circumstances of him who prays, but never to the 
omission of this, the regular and set form of prayer.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.33>(<I>b</I>) Certain ceremonies, "empty" (vacuae) Tertullian 
calls them, but illustrative of many an interesting point of ritual and practice 
of the time, are next considered: Washing the hands before prayer; praying with 
the cloak taken off; sitting after prayer; the kiss of peace; the "Stations" (c. 
xix. ; see Oehler's note); the dress of women, and veiling or non-veiling of 
virgins; kneeling in prayer; place and time of prayer; prayer when brethren met 
or parted; prayer and psalm. The closing chapter, dealing with the power and 
effect of prayer, is one of the gems of Tertullian's writings. "Never," he 
cries, "let us walk unarmed by prayer. Under the arms of prayer guard we the 
standard of our emperor; in prayer await we the angel's trump. Angels pray; 
every creature prays. 'Quid amplius? Etiam ipse Dominus oravit.'"</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.34><I>De Baptismo.</I>--One Quintilla, "a viper of the 
Cainite heresy," had sought to destroy baptism. "What good could water do? Was 
it to be believed that a man could go down into the water, have a few words 
spoken over him, and rise again the gainer of eternity?" (see c. vi.). Quintilla 
was apparently a Gnostic, and the very simplicity of the means of grace repelled 
her. "Miratur simplicia quasi vana, magnifica quasi impossibilia." Her sneers 
had corrupted some; others were disturbed by such doubts as, Why was baptism 
necessary? Abraham was justified without it. The Christ Himself did not baptize. 
No mention was made in Scripture of the baptism of the apostles; St. Paul 
himself was bidden not to practise it.<PB id=Page_945 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y"

<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.35>(<I>a</I>) The foundation for the sacrament 
(<I>religionem</I>) of baptism Tertullian finds in (cc. i.-ix.) the history of 
the creation. The hovering of the Spirit of God over the waters was typical of 
baptism; and water still, after invocation of God, furnished the sacrament of 
sanctification. Shortly but beautifully he describes the baptismal ceremonies 
(cf. <I>de Spect.</I> c. iv.), notes the types and figures of baptism in O.T., 
and the testimony to baptism in the life and passion of the Lord.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.36>(<I>b</I>) Larger questions acquiescing in the necessity 
of baptism awaited consideration.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.37>(i) <I>Heretical Baptism</I>.--Christians held firmly to a 
belief in one God, one Baptism, one Church. This unity was, as regards baptism, 
imperilled by heretical baptism. The <I>ademptio communicationis</I> (by some = 
deprivation of communion; by others = excommunication) stamped heretics as 
strangers. "We and they have not the same God, nor one [<I>i.e.</I> the same] 
Christ. Therefore we and they have not one [<I>i.e.</I> the same] baptism. What 
[baptism] they have, they have it not rightly, and therefore have not baptism at 
all." On these grounds he rejected heretical baptism. On the whole subject 
consult <I>Libr. of the Fath.</I> x. pp. 280 seq.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.38>(ii) <I>Second Baptism</I>.--The belief and practice of 
the church Tertullian states thus: "We enter the font but once; our sins are 
washed away but once, because they ought not to be repeated." The Christian had, 
nevertheless, a second baptism, viz. the Baptism of Blood (cf. Luke xii. 50). 
Two baptisms had Christ sent forth from the wounds in His pierced side, that 
they who believed in His Blood might be washed with water, and that they who had 
been washed with water might also drink His Blood. This was that Baptism which 
stood in the place of the font when it had not been received, or restored it 
when lost (cf. <I>Scorp.</I> c. vii.).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.39>(<I>c</I>) The remainder of the treatise deals with points 
of church practice and discipline as regards baptism (cc. xvii.-xx.). Laymen as 
well as clerics could administer it, but only if disciples and in cases of 
necessity. "Layman" was not taken to include women. Baptism was not to be 
administered rashly (cf. <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+7:6," 
id=iii.xx.vi.p3.40>Matt. vii. 6</A>). Tertullian, like the teachers of 
Alexandria, recommends delaying it in the case of children, till they had passed 
"the age of innocence," and in the case of the unwedded and widowed. The times 
most suitable for baptism were the Passover and Pentecost; but not to the 
exclusion of other opportunities. When about to receive baptism, candidates 
should prepare themselves by prayer, fasting, vigil, and confession of sins (cf. 
<A class=scripRef href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+3:6," 
id=iii.xx.vi.p3.41>Mat. iii. 6</A>); and after baptism they should rejoice 
rather than fast. Tertullian suggests to them a prayer: "When you rise from that 
holy font of your new birth and spread your hands for the first time in the 
house of your mother Church with your brethren, ask of the Father, ask of the 
Lord, special grace ["peculia gratiae"] and the divers gifts of the Holy Spirit 
["distributiones charismatum"]. And, he adds with touching humility, "I pray you 
that when you ask, you remember in your prayers Tertullian the sinner."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.42><I>De Poenitentia.</I>--Repentance of sin before baptism 
(cc. i.-vi.). True repentance had its measure and its limit in the fear of God. 
God Himself initiated repentance, when He rescinded His sentence on Adam. He 
exhorted men to it by His Prophets; by St. John He pointed out its sign and seal 
in baptism. Its aim was the salvation of man through the abolition of sin. There 
was a tendency to say "God was satisfied with the devotion of heart and mind. 
Even if men did sin in act, they could do so without prejudice to their faith 
and fear." With an intensity of sarcasm Tertullian replies, "You shall be thrust 
down into hell without prejudice to your pardon." Such Antinomianism explained 
another frequent and lamentable practice. The Christians of the day most firmly 
believed in the washing away of sins in Holy Baptism, and in the necessity of 
true repentance as preparatory to the reception of it; but this led "novices" 
("inter auditorum tirocinia") not to a willing and holy eagerness to receive 
baptism, but to a presumptuous and unholy spirit of delay, that they (the 
soldiers of the Cross) might steal the intervening time as a furlough 
("commentum") for sinning rather than for learning not to sin. Tenderly and 
wisely does Tertullian plead with them. "If a man who has given himself to God 
is not to cease sinning till he be bound by baptism, I hardly know whether he 
will not feel, after baptism, more sorrow than joy."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p3.43><I>De Spectaculis.</I>--A period of temporary peace after 
persecution (cf. c. xxvii.) had fallen upon the church in Carthage. Spectacular 
shows and games were being given, possibly in commemoration of the victory of 
Severus over Albinus, and the grave question had to be faced--Should Christians 
attend them? The seal (<I>signaculum</I>) of baptism supplied <I>the</I> reason 
against attendance. All the preparations connected with the spectacles were 
based upon idolatry, and idolatry was renounced at the font. In cc. v.-xiii. 
Tertullian draws out in detail the origin of the spectacles, their titles, 
apparatus, localities, and arts; and the reader can realize to the very life the 
places and scenes he describes in impassioned but often one-sided invective. 
Everywhere in the circus were images and statues, chariots dedicated to gods, 
their thrones, crowns, and equipments. Religious rites preceded, intervened, and 
succeeded the games; guilds, priests, and attendants served the <I>conventus 
daemoniorum</I>. Consecrated to the sun, the solar temple rose in the midst, the 
solar effigy glittered on the summit. The chariots of the circus were dedicated 
to the gods, the charioteers wore the colours (white, red, green, and blue) of 
idolatry. The <I>designator</I> and the <I>haruspex</I> were two most befouled 
masters of the ceremonies connected with the funereal and sacrificial rites. The 
<I>theatrum</I> was the home of Venus and Bacchus; the performances there 
claimed their patronage. The very artistic gifts employed in producing the 
spectacles were the inspiration of demons, glozed over by a fallacious 
consecration. Men pleaded, "We cannot live without pleasure." Well, Christians 
had
pleasures many and noble. What greater
pleasure could be conceived than reconciliation
to God and pardon of the many sins of a
past life? What delight should exceed the
trampling idolatry under foot, the expulsion
of demons, acts of healing, a life unto God?
These were the pleasures and spectacles of
Christians, holy, perpetual, and free. In the
Christian circus they might behold immodesty
hurled down by chastity, perfidy slain by
fidelity, cruelty bruised by mercy, wantonness
overcome by modesty! These were the
contests in which to gain the Christian crown.
"Or do you wish to see the blood shed?
Behold Christ&#39;s!" Then Tertullian closes
his eyes to the spectacles of earth. There
looms before him (c. xxx.) <i>the</i> spectacle close
at hand of the Lord coming in His glory and
triumph. He depicts angels exulting, saints
rising from the dead, the kingdom of the just
and the city of the New Jerusalem, the hell
of the persecutor and scoffer; and there were
spectacles even more glorious still. Man
could not conceive them; but they were
nobler than those of the circus, the amphitheatre,
or the racecourse.</p>

<p>

<i>De Cultu Feminarum, i. </i>and ii.-The luxury
and extravagance of the women of the time is
matter of notoriety. Tertullian and Clement
of Alexandria do not express one whit more
strongly than Seneca their ambition, cruelty,
and licentiousness. Therefore, when women
became Christians, and matronly and wifely
virtues or virgin purity and modesty characterized them, it extorted the admiration of
some and the impatient scorn of others. But
luxury began to creep in and overrule the
daughters of the church. Tertullian saw it,
and the above works were among other efforts
to recall Christian women to the Christian life.

<i>De Idololatyia is </i>a protest against serving
two masters-Christianity and heathenism.
Many Christians had in adult age come over
to Christianity from heathenism, and many
Christian craftsmen gained their living by
distinctly heathen trades, and would not or
could not see that they were wrong. Many
" servants of God " had official or professional
engagements which brought them perpetually
in contact with heathen customs, legal forms,
sacrificial acts, and social courtesies. They
drew sophistical distinctions between what
they might write but not speak, or the image
they might make but not worship. To
Tertullian such contact and collusion, and
therefore such professions and trades, were
radically wrong. Heathenism in all its shapes
was idolatry. Two professions connected
with idolatry were especially obnoxious to
him, <i>(a) </i>the astrologer (c. ix.), arguing that
" astrology was the science of the stars which
affirmed the Advent of Christ " ; (b) the schoolmaster <i>(ludimagister) </i>and other professors of
letters (c. x. ), who had to teach the names,
genealogies, honours of heathen gods, and
keep their estivals from which they derived
their income. On festival-days, in honour of
emperors, victories, and the like, the doors of
Christians were more decorated with lamps
and laurels than those of the heathen (cf. ApoL.
c. xxxv. ), men quoting Christ&#39;s command;
" Render unto Caesar the things which are

</p>

Caesar&#39;s " (Matt. xxii. 


2i 


).Private and

<p>


social festivals stood on a different footing
<i>(c. xvi.), e.g. </i>the natural ceremonies connected with the assumption of the <i>toga virilis,
</i>espousals, nuptials, and the naming of children.
It was a more important question (c. xvii.)
what was to be the line of slaves or children
who were believers, of officials in attendance
upon their lords, patrons, or the chief magistrates when sacrificing ? Tertullian answers
all such questions in detail. From idolatry
in act Tertullian passes to idolatry in word
(c. xx.), forbidding ejaculations such as " By
Hercules ! " " By the god of truth " (Medius<i>idius, </i>see Andrews&#39;s Lex. s.n. <i>Fidius). </i>Lastly
a yet subtler form of idolatry is considered
(c. xxiii.). Christians borrowed money from
the heathen, and by giving bonds in security
avoided taking an oath. " Scripsi sed nihil
dixi. Non negavi, c(uia non juravi." Indignantly does Tertullian protest against such
sophistry: faults committed in mind were
faults in deed (Matt. v. 


28).

</p>
<p>

<i>De Patientia, </i>one of the most spiritual of
Tertullian&#39;s compositions, is a sermon
preached to himself quite as much as to
others. His experience as a priest had
taught him the need of patience every time
he confronted pettiness not less than pride,
frivolity not less than idolatry.

</p>
<p>

<i>Ad Uxorem, i. </i>and ii.-Among the questions
discussed in, and disturbing, the Christian
church at Carthage was that of second marriages. These were evidently numerous.
Tertullian gave his advice in a treatise in two
books addressed to his wife, which he hoped
might be profitable to her and to any other
woman " belonging to God." He does not
go here beyond the position taken by St. Paul.
If he evidently considered celibacy the higher
state, though himself married, he does not
forbid marriage. But second marriages were
different, and he argues strongly against them.

<i>Doctrinal Treatises</i>.-Three positions
laid down by Tertullian (de Praes. Haer. cc.
xxi. xxxii. xxxvi.), (a) apostolic doctrine,


<i>(b) </i>


episcopal succession from the apostles,
(c) the apostolic canon of Scripture, were rocks
on which the church was then firmly fixed.

</p>
<p>

(a) His Regula <i>Fidei (cf</i>. de Praes. Haer. c.
xiii. ; de Virg. Vel. c. i. ; adv. Prax. c. ii.) is


the form given by Irenaeus (<i>contr. Haer.</i> 1
c. x.; cf. the two in Denzinger&#39;s <i>Enchiridion</i>,
pp. 1, 2), expanded upon points which had
come to the front during a lapse of about 30
years. But it had become something more
than a mere <i>regula</i>; it had risen to a <i>doctrina</i>;
and in the brotherhood of Carthage it was the
contesseratio (cf. <i>de Praes. Haer.</i> cc. xx.
xxxvi.) which reason and tradition united in
approving. (<i>b</i>) The <i>regula</i> had come down
to them through bishops "per successionern
ab initio decurrentem" (cf. <i>ib.</i> c. xxxii.), and
those bishops had received "cum successione
charisma veritatis certum" (Iren. iv. c. xxvi.
2). The former fact gave historical value to
the <i>regula</i>, the latter dogmatic credibility.
The unworthy life of many a successor of the
apostles (cf. <i>de Pudicitia</i>, c. i.) did not annul
the validity of the doctrine. For (<i>c</i>) it was
supported by the Scriptures. In the time of
Irenaeus and Tertullian the Law and the
Prophets, the Gospels and the Apostolic
Epistles (cf. <i>de Praes. Haer.</i> c. xxxvi.)

formed an undisputed canon. Tertullian&#39;s
nomenclature for the Bible (see Ronsch, 


<i>Das
N. T. Tertullian&#39;s, pp. 47-4g) </i>


is alone sufficient
record of the high value attached to the
writings in the custody of "the one Holy
Catholic Church." The sacred Scriptures
contained the solution of every difficulty (cf.


<i>de Idolotat. c. iv. et pass.). </i>


It was the
armoury of weapons offensive and defensive
which the church permitted her children
alone to use (cf. 


<i>de Praes. c. </i>


xv., etc.), for she
alone had taught them to use them aright.
With such an equipment and in defence of
"mother " church 


<i>(ad Mart. c. i.; de Oyat. c. ii.
</i>


and 


<i>aliter), </i>


Tertullian went forth to attack
the "heresies" of men who, calling them.
selves Christians, yet abandoned the apostolic
tradition for doctrines whose parentage he
attributed to the devil, and whose precepts
he scorned as derived from non-Christian
religious systems and speculations, or as the
offspring of self-willed wickedness.

</p>

<i>De Praescriptione Haereticoyum. - This
<p>
</i>


treatise, with its title drawn from the language
of jurisprudence, consists of (i), an introduction (cc. i.-xiv.), (ii) the main division of
the work (cc. xv.-xl.). It is more than
probable that it originated in the desire to
emphasize the doctrinal stability of the
African church in the face of some fresh
tendency towards Gnosticism in general and
the views of Marcion especially. (i), Persons
of weak faith and character (c. iii.) were unsettled because some once accounted firm in
the faith were passing over to heresy; and it
was not sufficient simply to refer to Scripture,
which the Gnostic teachers could apply as
much as the orthodox. For the time Tertullian conceived no better way of meeting their
difficulty than by positive injunction to refuse appeal to Scripture to their would-be
seducers, to note the character of the heretics,
and to surrender themselves entirely to the
guidance of the church. The authority men
advanced for their deviations from the faith
was nothing less than the words of the Lord,
" Seek, and ye shall find " (Matt. vii. 


<i>7). </i>


Tertullian argues that Christ&#39;s words could bear
no such interpretation; they contained
advice to search after definite truth and to
rest content with it when found. There was
safety only in the belief that " Christus
instituit quod quaeri oportet, quod credi
necesse est." Parables (Luke xi. 5, xv. 8,
xviii. 


2, 


3) taught the same lesson-" finis est
et quaerendi et pulsandi et petendi." There.
fore Christians were to seek " in their own,
from their own, and concerning their own ;
and only such questions as might be deliberated without prejudice to the rule of
faith.

</p>
<p>

This mention of the 


<i>yegula fidei </i>


leads (c. xiii.)
to the statement: of it. This passage is therefore one of the most important in Tertullian&#39;s
writings as an index to the articles of the
Christian faith believed and accepted in his
day (consult Pusey&#39;s notes in loco). This
"rule" the Christians held to have been
taught by Christ. Tertullian is quite willing
(a. xiv.) that it should be examined, discussed,
and explained to novices by some " doctor
gratia scientiae donatus." But he gives a
caution. It was not Biblical skill (" exer-

</p>


TERTULLIANU3   949

<p>


citatio scripturarum ") but faith which saved
(cf. Luke xviii. 


<i>42). </i>


Faith lay deposited in
this " rule " ; it had a law, and in the keeping
of that law came salvation. " Cedat curiositas
fidei, cedat gloria saluti."

</p>
<p>

(ii) Chaps. xv.-xl.-Heresy was sometimes
defended on the ground that heretics used and
argued from the Scriptures. But, answered
Tertullian, their use of them was " audacious "
and not to be admitted. None but they whose
were the Scriptures had a right to use them.
Tertullian adopts this position not from any
distrust of his cause, but in accordance with
apostolic injunctions (c. xvi. ; cf. I. Tim. vi.
3, 4 ; Tit. iii. ro). Heretics did not deal
fairly with the Scriptures; one passage they
perverted, another they interpreted to suit
their own purposes (cf. c. xxxviii.). A man
might have a most admirable knowledge of
the Scripture, but yet make no progress with
heretical disputants. Everything he maintained they would deny, everything he denied
they would maintain. As a result, the weak
in faith, seeing neither side had decidedly the
better in the discussion, would go away confirmed in uncertainty. Certain questions
had therefore to be settled. Where was the
true faith ? Whose were the Scriptures ?
From whom, through whom, when, and to
whom had been handed down the " disciplina
qua fiunt Christiani " ? It might be assumed
that wherever the true Christian discipline and
faith was, there would be also the true Scriptures, true exposition, and all true Christian
traditions (c. xix.). In Christ, Tertullian
finds Him Who first delivered the faith openly
to the people or privately to His disciples, of
whom He had chosen twelve " destinatos
nationibus magistros." These twelve (St.
Matthias having been chosen in the place of
Judas) went forth and founded churches
everywhere; and from them other churches
derived then, and still derived, the tradition
of faith and the seeds of doctrine. Hence
their name of " apostolic churches." Though
so many, they sprang from but one, the
primitive church founded by the apostles.
Thus all were primitive, all apostolic, all one;
and this unity was proved by their peaceful
inter-communion, by the title of brotherhood,
and by the exercise of hospitality-all of
which owed their basis and continuance to one
and the same sacramental faith. From this
was to be deduced the first rule (c. xxi.)

</p>
<p>

None were to be received (cf. Matt. 


Xi. 


27) as
preachers but those (apostles) whom the Lord
Jesus Christ appointed and sent. A second
rule was that what the apostles preached
could only be proved by those churches which
the apostles themselves founded, to which they
preached, and to which they afterwards sent
epistles. All doctrine therefore which agreed
with these apostolic churches (" matricibus et
originalibus fidei ") was to be counted true,
and firmly held as having been received by the
church from the apostles, by the apostles from
Christ, by Christ from God; and all doctrine
must be pronounced false which contained
anything contrary to the truth declared by the
churches and apostles of Christ and of God.
These rules Tertullian and his co-religionists
affirmed to be held by the Holy Church to
which they belonged: " Communicamus cum

ecclesiis Apostolicis, quod nulla doctrina
diversa. Hoc est testimonium veritatis."

</p>
<p>

Heretics advanced two " mad " objections
to these rules: (a) The apostles did not know
all things (c. xxii.). (b) Arguing from
I. Tim. 


Vi. 


2o and II. Tim. i. iq., the apostles
did not reveal everything to all men. Some
doctrines they proclaimed openly and to all,
others secretly and to a few (c. xxv.). Tertullian addressed himself to both these points.

</p>
<p>

C. 


<i>Teytullian and </i>


Montanism.-About the
end of 2nd cent. Montanism invaded Africa.
Tertullian would seem to have embraced it
wholeheartedly. It suited his temperament;
it furnished the logical solutions to problems
practical and theological which had been
disturbing him. But his Montanism was
not the Montanism of x72-x77 or of Asia
Minor ; it had come to him through the
purifying medium of distance and time.
He knew or remembered nothing of the
extravagances connected with the first deliverances of the "new prophets." Montanism was in truth to Tertullian little more than
a name; development and restoration rather
than novelty underlie the intention, and are
stamped upon the thoughts, of every treatise
which follows those hitherto considered. The
practices Tertullian favoured and advocated,
the doctrines he loved and enforced, had alike
their roots in the existing practices and doctrines of the church. It is the manner in
which he has insisted upon the one which has
so much discredited it ; it is the juridical
fence with which he has driven home the other
which has angered opponents. He defended
his practice and teaching as necessary for his
day. New fasts, protests against second
marriages, a sterner accentuation of discipline,
were conceived as absolutely necessary by the
man who, beginning by tightening bonds
which the church had wisely left relaxed,
ended by the Pharisaic assumption that he
and his were Tvevaarucol and his opponents


&cent;nXWOf. 


But if he drew his descriptive language from Gnostic codes, he burned in the
spirit to depose Gnostic heresy. The merit
he assigned to ecstasy, dream, vision, new
prophecy, and special endowment by the
Paraclete, were expansions of simpler but
Scriptural teaching, with something of Pharisaic lordliness, but ever directed against the
Sadduceeism, the materialism, the Patripassianism, and the Monarchianism of his day.

</p>
<p>

The career of Tertullian, his whole being and
character, left him no choice when he had to
make his decision. He was bound to side
with the sterner party, and he did. If at first
he retained his position in the church, that
position before long became intolerable. The
breach took place of which the 


<i>de </i>


Virg. 


<i>Vel.
</i>


gives the ostensible cause ; and the passion
which animated the apologist in defence of the
church was presently employed to revile,
discard, and injure her. Few treatises are
more painful to read than the 


<i>de </i>


Monogamia,


<i>de </i>


Jeyunio, and de Pudicitia. It is a relief
to turn from them to the adv. Praxean. If
the heart of the ascetic has been alienated
from the church, he can still defend her faith
with all his old loving energy, and, by his last
existing writing, command respect from those
whose affection he had lost.

</p>


TERTULLIANUS

<p>


(i) Practical 


<i>T-reatises.-De Corona </i>


is
usually counted the first treatise which indicates traces of Montanism (cf. c. i. ; Hauck
places the de Virg. Vel. before it), and it was
written after the 


<i>de Spectac. </i>


(cf. e. vi.).
Opinions were divided as to the soldier&#39;s
conduct. Some blamed him as rash, as eager
to die, some as bringing trouble on the Christian name about a mere matter of dress.
Tertullian, with one word of laudation of the
man-" solus scilicet fortis inter tot fratres
commilitones, solus Christianus "-turns furiously upon his decriers.

</p>
<p>

<i>De </i>


Fuga in 


<i>Peysecutione.-It may </i>


well have
been that excitement threatening persecution
was aroused against Christians by the conduct
of the soldier specified in the <i>de </i>Corona. In
Carthage (c. iii.) the question was anxiously
debated, " May Christians flee from persecution or not ? " The clergy answered " Yes,"
and set an example (c. xi.), which they probably defended by Christ&#39;s words (Matt. x.
23), and by the practice of a Polycarp and
others. A few years before <i>(ad </i>Uxor. i. c. iii.)
Tertullian himself had conceded that flight
was " better " where the Christian was likely
to deny the faith through the agony of torture; but now he thought differently. Montanistic severity had laid its spell upon him.
His work deals with the two modes by which
the timid and doubtful sought to evade persecution: (a) flight (cc. i.-xi.), and (b)
bribery (cc. xii.-end).

</p>
<p>

De Exhortatione Castitatis.-Some years had
elapsed since Tertullian had written ad
Uxorem, deprecating for women a second
marriage. The death of, a friend&#39;s wife gave
him an opportunity of urging upon men a like
continence; and he did so in language declaratory of views far more exaggerated.

</p>
<p>

De Viyginibus Velandis.-The veiling of
virgins was a burning question among Christians at Carthage; and partisans in Carthage
took sides according as they argued from
what St. Paul (I. Cor. xi.) had said or had left
to be inferred. Did his term "women "
include virgins ? Christian married women
appeared veiled everywhere, in the church as
well as the marketplace; their veil was the
mark of their status. The Christian virgin
did one of three things : she went everywhere
unveiled, or veiled in the streets but unveiled
in the church, or everywhere veiled. Of these
the first was the oldest and local custom-it
was the mark of the virgin and the practice
of the majority. But a strong minority had
adopted the last of the three practices. This
Tertullian approved (cf. de Orat. cc. xx.-xxii.).

</p>
<p>

(2) 


Doctrinal Works.-The majority of
these were written when Tertullian had become a Montanist. They present more or
less the catch-words of the sect, and refer to
the Paraclete and the new prophecy, if the
doctrines inculcated and defended are those
of the church Catholic. To be a Montanist
was not with Tertullian to be a seceder from
the church in points of faith, though the
church found it necessary for the sake of her
unity in life and doctrine to count him and
his outside her.

Adv. Heymogenem.-For the nature of the
opinions of this heretical teacher and of Tertullian&#39;s treatise against him see HERMOGENES

The treatise contains two very beautiful
<p>



passages, (a) the eulogy of wisdom (c. xviii.),
and (b) the description of the development of
cosmical order out of chaos (c. xxix.).

</p>
<p>

Adv. <i>Valentinianos.-For a </i>review of the
opinions of this school (" frequentissimum
plane collegium inter haereticos ") see 


VALENTINUS. 


Tertullian&#39;s treatise does not so much
discuss these opinions as state them; , it is not
so much a refutation as a satire, intended
to provoke mirth (c. vi.). It claims no originality, but to be a faithful reflection of the
teaching of Justin, Miltiades (cf. Eus. H. E.
v. 17) Irenaeus, and Proculus.

</p>
<p>

De Carne Christi.-This is Tertullian&#39;s
principal contribution to the Christological
problem of the time: Was the flesh of Christ
born of the Virgin and human in its nature
(c. xxxv.)? In his de Resurrectione Carnis
(c. ii.) he himself specifies the tenets he opposes
here to be those of Marcion, Basilides, Valentinus, and Apelles. These " modern Sadducees " (c. i. ; de Praes. Haer. c. xxxiii.) were
apprehensive lest if they admitted the reality
of Christ&#39;s flesh, they must also admit His
resurrection in the flesh, and consequently
the resurrection generally. It was necessary
to discuss, therefore, His bodily substance. (i)
(a) Marcion&#39;s views are examined (cc. ii.-v.);
then (b) those of Apelles (cc. vi.-ix.) ; then (c)
that of the Valentinians (cc. x.-xvi.). (ii) The
second part of the treatise deals more especially with the single point-" Did Christ receive flesh from the Virgin " (cc. xvii.-end) ?

</p>
<p>

The treatise fully responds to the intention
of the writer. It examines the arguments
employed and the Scriptures advanced (see
esp. c. xviii.) ; and does so, on the whole, in a
style moulded by the recollection that the
subject was a grave and solemn one. There
are bursts of irony (e.g. cc. ii. iv.) ; paradoxes
(see c. v., perhaps the most famous of Tertullian&#39;s many paradoxes) and retorts; but the
total result is a valuable contribution to the
literature of the subject. His line of argument and his statement of the church&#39;s
doctrine is that of Irenaeus. For a general
view of the opinions attacked see 


APELLES,
MARCION, 


and 


VALENTINUS.

</p>
<p>

De <i>Resurrectione C</i>arnis.-Tertullian wrote
this (c. ii.) in fulfilment of the intention expressed in the <i>de </i>Carne Christi (c. xxv.),
against those who allowed that the soul would
rise again, but refused resurrection to the flesh
on account of its worthlessness. It was a
logical sequence to their fundamental position.
that the works of the Demiurge, or the god
who created the world and was opposed to the
supreme God, were marked by corruption and
worthlessness, and that the flesh of man was
consequently so also. Tertullian grants that
his subject was invested with uncertainty; but
it was too important to be passed over. The
question affected the very Oneness of the
Godhead. To deny the resurrection of the
flesh would be to shake that doctrine, to vindicate the resurrection of the flesh would establish it. In contrast to the unseemly language
(spurciloquium) of heathen and heretic, he will
adopt a mote honourable and modest style (cf.
<i>de </i>Anima, c. xxxii.) ; and he has kept his
word. Tere are few sentences which grate
upon the ear, while there are many passages of

</p>


TERTULLIANUS   949

considerable beauty and profound Christian



faith.
<p>


Adv. <i>Marcionem, Us</i>. i.-v.-This work in
its present form is assigned to the 15th year
of Severus (bk. i. c. xv.) or c. 2o8 ; and comes
to us as a work touched and retouched during
many years (cf. i. c. xxii.). Tertullian had in
other cases felt dissatisfaction with his writings
of an earlier period, or altered his arguments
to meet the ever-altering phases of false
belief. Thus in the earlier work, de Praes.
<i>Haer. c</i>. xix., he declines to allow appeal to
the Scriptures in the discussion of heresy ; in
a later treatise, de Resurr. Carnis, c. iii., he
demands of heretics that they should support
their inquiries from Scripture alone (cf. adv.
Prax. c. xi.). So now, his earliest edition of
this treatise, if placed (conjecturally) c. Zoo,
would have seemed to him very defective
when writing c. 2o8. He had separated from
his old friends, now branded as the " Psy.
chics " (iv. c. xxii.), to find among the Montanists the true church (i. c. xxi. ; iv. c. v.).
To him " the new prophecy " was now the
highest authority, the Paraciete the sole guide
unto all truth. The doctrinal controversy
between Tertullian and Marcion turned principally on questions of anthropology and
Christology. All that Tertullian has to say
upon it has been summed up under 


MARCION.

</p>
<p>

De Anima.-In the treatise <i>de Testimonio
</i>Animae Tertullian had sought to prove that
the soul of man bore natural testimony to the
truth of the representations given in Holy
Scripture of the unity, nature, and attributes
of God, and of a future state. In the treatise
<i>de Anima, </i>written some ten years or so later,
he deals with the soul itself. Between these
surviving treatises is to be placed one now lost,
<i>de Censu Animae, in </i>which he had combated
the opinion of Hermogenes that the origin of
the soul was to be found in matter by the
counter-opinion that it was formed by the
<i>afflatus </i>of God (cf. <i>de Anima, cc. i. iii. xi. ;
adv. Marc. ii. c. ix.). </i>The attributes of the
<i>soul (animae naturalia) </i>pointed, in his opinion,
to propinquity to God and not to matter (cf.
<i>de Anima, c. </i>xxii.), an opinion supported by
the views of Plato, who had taught the
<i>divinatio animae </i>(cf. <i>de Anima, c. xxiv.).
</i>The discussion of its origin is followed by a
general inquiry respecting the nature, powers,
and destiny of the soul. An admirable
analysis is that of Bp. Kaye (pp. x78-207; cf.
also Neander, the careful analysis of Bohringer, and Hauck). In c. xxii. Tertullian
gives his definition of the soul as deriving its
origin from the breath of God (iv. xi.). The
soul is immortal, corporeal (v.-viii.), and
endowed with form (ix.); simple in its substance (x. xi.) ; possessing within itself the
principle of intelligence (xii.); working in
different ways or channels (xiii.-xv.) ; endued
with free will; affected by external circumstances, and thus producing the infinite vari.
ety of disposition observable among mankind;
rational (xvi.); supreme over man (xvii. xviii.);
and possessing natural insight into futurity
(xix.). The Gospels, in <i>(e.g.) </i>the history of
the rich man in torment (Luke xvi. 23, 24),
proved the corporeity of the soul (c. vii. ; also
a Stoic opinion), and medical science, " the
sister of philosophy," in the volumes of a




contemporary physician, Soranus (c. vi.), also attested 
this belief. The invisibility of the soul was no disproof of its corporeity; 
witness St. John, who, "when in the spirit," "beheld the souls of the martyrs " 
(Rev. vi. 9); witness also the testimony of "the sister so endowed with gifts of 
revelation" (c. ix.). This latter testimony is of interest as exhibiting 
Montanist religious observances. Revelations used to come to her in the church 
on the Lord's Day. While the solemn services were being performed, she used to 
fall into an "ecstasy in the spirit." In that state she conversed with angels, 
sometimes even with the Lord; she saw and heard mysteries (<I>sacramenta</I>); 
she read men's hearts; she prescribed remedies to the sick. Sometimes these 
visions took place when the Scriptures were being read, or when the Psalms were 
being chanted, or at the time of preaching or of prayer. On one occasion 
Tertullian thinks that he must have been preaching about the soul. The "sister" 
was rapt in spiritual ecstasy. After the people had been dismissed, she told 
him, as was her habit, what she had seen. "The soul was shewn to me in a bodily 
form. It seemed a spirit; not, however, an empty illusion, but one which could 
be grasped, 'tenera et lucida et aerii coloris, et forma per omnia humana.'" 
Such testimony was to the Montanist Tertullian all-conclusive.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.1>The main purpose of cc. xxiii.-xxvii. is to prove that the 
souls of all mankind are derived from one common source, the soul of Adam. In 
cc. xxviii.-xxxv. Tertullian ridicules the conclusions necessitated by 
metempsychosis and metemsomatosis.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.2>As a preliminary to the consideration of the manner in 
which the soul encounters death, Tertullian considers the subject of sleep--the 
image of death (cc. xlii.-end). He adopts by preference the Stoic definition of 
sleep as the temporary suspension of the activity of the senses ("resolutionem 
sensualis vigoris"), and limits the senses affected to those of the body; the 
soul, being immortal, neither requiring nor admitting a state of rest. While the 
body is asleep or dead, the soul is elsewhere.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.3>Death, to which Tertullian now turns (c.1.), was to be the 
lot of all, let Epicurus and Menander say what they would. The voice of God 
(Gen. ii. 17) had declared death to be the death of nature. Independent of 
heathen examples of this truth, Tertullian finds one in the translation of Enoch 
and Elijah. Their death was deferred only; "they were reserved for a future 
death, that by their blood they might extinguish Antichrist" (Oehler refers to 
Rev. xi. 3). Where would the soul be when divested of the body (cc. 
liii.-lviii.)? Tertullian answers, In Hades; but his Hades is not that of Plato, 
nor his answer to the question that adopted by philosophers. To Hades, "a 
subterranean region," did Christ go (Matt. xii. 40; I. Pet. iii. 19); therefore 
Christians must keep at arms' length those who were too proud to believe that 
the souls of the faithful deserved to be placed in the lower regions. From Hades 
shall men remove to heaven at the day of judgment. But what would take place 
while the soul was in Hades? Would it sleep? No, Tertullian replies; souls do 
not sleep when men are alive. Full well the soul will know in Hades how to feel 
joy or sorrow even without the body. The "prison" of the Gospel (Matt. v. 25) 
was Hades, and "the uttermost farthing" the very smallest offence which had to 
be atoned there before the resurrection. Hence the soul must undergo in Hades 
some compensatory discipline without prejudice to the full accomplishment of the 
resurrection, when recompense would be paid to the flesh also. This conclusion 
Tertullian affirms to be one communicated by the Paraclete, and therefore 
accepted by all who admitted the force of His words from a knowledge of His 
promised gifts.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.4><I>De Pallio.</I>--This, a treatise intentionally 
extravagant, is a vindication of the philosopher's mantle (<I>pallium</I>) 
ridiculed by the people of Carthage. It might be called a juridical plea, 
couched in witty and forensic language, in an imaginary case of Pallium (see 
description <I>s.v.</I> in <I>D. C. A.</I>) <I>v.</I> Toga. Some have seen in 
Tertullian's assumption of the <I>pallium</I> an indication that he adopted it 
to show his separation from the church. The conjecture has nothing to prove or 
disprove it. The mantle had virtues of its own (cc. v. vi.). Did it not 
illustrate simplicity and capacity, economy and austerity, in protest against 
the follies and effeminacies, the gluttony and extravagance, the impurity and 
intemperance of the <I>togati</I>? "Grande pallii beneficium est." It was the 
garb not only of the philosopher, but also of those benefactors of the human 
race--the grammarian and the rhetorician, the sophist and the physician, the 
poet and the musician, the student of astronomy and the pupil of national 
history. In face of such facts, why mind the sneer, "The <I>pallium</I> ranked 
below the toga of the Roman knight," or the indignant question, "Shall I give up 
my <I>toga</I> for the <I>pallium</I>"? There was no indignity in the matter. 
"'Gaude gallium et exsulta!' Thou art honoured by a better philosophy from the 
time that thou didst become a Christian garment."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.5><I>Scorpiace.</I>--A defence of martyrdom stronger than is 
found in the Montanist works of his previous period, perhaps <I>c.</I> 211.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.6><I>Ad Scapulam.</I>--Probably at the beginning of the reign 
of Caracalla, A.D. 211, the African proconsula Scapula authorized the 
persecution to which this work refers. He was a fierce opponent of the 
Christians, and permitted his fanaticism to override his sense of justice (c. 
iv.). This treatise uses the arguments of the <I>Apology</I>, but with a change 
in tone. Tertullian's passion is still strong, but gravely and soberly 
expressed. There is the same appeal for justice, but defiance has given place to 
prayer, and hatred of the persecutor to love for the enemy. The treatise may 
fairly take rank among the best and most interesting of all which have been 
preserved. Scapula is told frankly that they who had joined the "sect" of 
Christians were prepared to accept its conditions. The persecutions of men 
ignorant of what they were doing did not alarm them or make them shrink from 
heathen "savagery." Against the charges usually brought against them (cf. c. 
ii.; <I>Apol.</I> cc. vii.-ix.) Scapula should set one plain fact--the behaviour 
of Christians. They formed the<PB id=Page_951 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y"

marked by silence and modesty. Their "discipline" enforced a patience which was 
divine; if they were known at all among men, it was for their reformation of the 
vices which once degraded them. Tertullian does not write to intimidate, but to 
warn--<FONT face=symbol>mh qeomacein</FONT>. "Perform your duties as proconsul, 
but remember to be humane." If the Christians of Carthage should see fit to come 
to Scapula, how many swords and fires would he need for such multitudes of every 
sex, age, and rank! He would have to slaughter the leading persons of the city, 
and decimate the noble men and women of his own rank, friends and relations of 
his own circle. "Spare thyself, Scapula, if thou wilt not spare us. Spare 
Carthage, if thou wilt not spare thyself. Spare thy province, which the mere 
mention of thine intention has subjected to the threats and extortions of 
soldiers and of private foes [cf. <I>de Fuga</I>, cc. xii. xiii.]. As for us, we 
have no Master but God. Those whom you reckon your masters are but men, and must 
one day die. Our community shall never die. The more you pull it to the ground, 
the more it will be built up."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.7><I>De Monogamia.</I>--Some years passed, of peace from 
without but not from within; and a third time (c. 217) Tertullian returns to 
that question--marriage--which had occupied him in the <I>ad Uxorem</I> and 
<I>de Exhortatione Castitatis</I>. The third treatise is the bitterest. 
Tertullian now claims for his party that they and they alone were guided by the 
Paraclete. From Him they had received their teaching on monogamy. He had come to 
supersede the teaching of St. Paul by yet higher counsels of perfection. Much of 
Tertullian's argument--<I>e.g.</I> from Scripture--is repeated from his former 
treatises, and much of it is strained and conjectural, as he felt it would be 
said to be (c. ix.); but no one will dispute Tertullian's earnestness. 
Immorality was prevalent and contagious, and in monogamy--supposing celibacy and 
widowhood to be impossible--he saw a counteracting agency. Discipline and 
spirituality would be at least practicable to those who would rally round the 
standard of monogamy.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.8><I>De Jejunio Adversus Psychicos</I> (al. <I>de 
Jejuniis</I>).--Another great subject of difference between churchmen and 
Montanists had reference to fasts. Tertullian's paper is most distressing to 
read, scanty in argument, plentiful in abuse. Both sides indulged in unmeasured 
invective; both had lost their temper. The charges of luxury, gluttony, and 
immorality unhesitatingly and almost exultingly brought by Tertullian against 
church ecclesiastics and laymen are so gross as almost to refute themselves by 
their very exaggeration. They are more than the retort of a man infuriated by 
unjust accusations and meeting them by counter-charges. The ascetic has become a 
fanatic, and in his mad hatred besmirches and calumniates the church he had once 
so tenderly loved.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.9><I>De Pudicitia.</I>--This work has been placed before the 
de Monogamia and the <I>de Jejunio</I>, but internal and negative evidence, if 
slight, seems to assign it a place after them. An edict (c. i.) of the bp. of 
Rome (Zephyrinus, 202-218, or Callistus, 218-223) lashed Tertullian into fury, 
and completely dissolved the last links of union between him and the Psychics. 
The treatise is marked by intense bitterness from beginning to end.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p7.10><I>Adversus Praxean</I>.--For the history of Praxeas, the 
nature of his views and Tertullian's answer, see P<SMALL 
id=iii.xx.vi.p7.12>RAXEAS</SMALL>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p8>Tertullian was the first who, in the controversy against the 
Monarchians, introduced prominently the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. Praxeas did 
not touch it. Hence the value of such chapters as viii. ix. xxv. xxx. He fully 
maintains the personality of the Third Person of the Trinity (cf. <I>ad 
Mart.</I> c. iii.) if his language is occasionally ambiguous (cf. c. xii., his 
comment on Gen. i. 26). He bases as usual his arguments on Scripture (cc. xxi. 
to end), and if not always free from his well-known tendency to read into them 
what he wants, the passages are as a rule well and wisely handled either in 
defence of the Catholic position or in refutation of that of Praxeas. He gives 
(c. xx.) the 3 texts especially valued by this teacher in support of his heresy 
(Is. xlv. 5; John x. 30, xiv. 9, 10), and refutes his views at length (cc. 
xxi.-xxiv.).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p9><B>IV. S<SMALL id=iii.xx.vi.p9.1>UMMARY</SMALL></B>.--The 
brief sketch here presented of these powerful writings will have indicated the 
investigation of many a doctrine and the record of contemporaneous practices 
heathen and Christian, as well as illustrated the mind, character, and style of 
their writer.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p9.2>(a) <I>Tertullian and Heathenism.</I>--On its moral side, 
extravagance, luxury, immorality, and cruelty were to all external appearance as 
rampant in his day as ever. Tertullian knows heathenism only in its coarseness 
and repulsiveness. Yet a reformation was proceeding, religious in origin and 
intention, which must not be forgotten in any true estimate of the age. 
Tertullian lived when old pagan traditions and new tendencies were co-operating; 
when there had risen that religious movement which, owing its impulse to the 
eclecticism of a Julia Domna, passed through the stirring phases successively 
represented in the neo-Pythagoreanism of her salon, in the subordination by 
Elagabalus of every other cultus to that of the Oriental sun-god, and in the 
equalization by Alexander Severus of all worshipful beings in his common cultus 
of the heroes of humanity. That movement was the product of a real 
awakening.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p9.3>The main centre of these changes and developments was Rome, 
but Tertullian's writings against heathenism prove that Carthage at least felt 
the effects of this great tidal wave of religiousness. They are as full of 
attack as of defence. He strikes at a vigorous paganism as much as he beats off 
the charges alleged against Christianity. Every page teems with allusions which 
reflect without effort the firm foothold acquired by all forms of heathen 
cultus. Ridicule of the worship of the ancient deities of Greece and Rome, of 
the cultus of the emperors, of the "genius," and of demons is found allied with 
contempt of the gods of Alexandria (Isis and Serapis), of Phrygia (the Magna 
Mater and Bellona), of Syro-Phoenicia (the Dea Syra), and of Carthage (the Juno 
Coelestis). The very fierceness of his invective and scorn against the<PB

<I>galli</I> and <I>flamines</I>, priests and priestesses, itinerant and 
mendicant propagators of this or that cultus, guilds, processions, festivals, 
evidences the success and popularity of heathenism. The <I>Apology</I> of 
Apuleius (end of 2nd cent.) is illustrated by the <I>Apology</I> of Tertullian, 
and the statements of Dio, Spartian, Herodian, Lampridius, etc., can be compared 
with those of our writer. Were those heathen works lost, it would be almost 
possible to reproduce from his pages, shorn of their extravagance, a picture of 
the religiousness of the age such as they have given.</P>(b) <I>Tertullian and 
Christianity.</I>--In passing from heathenism to Christianity, Tertullian 
believed himself to be passing from darkness to light and from corruption to 
purity. He embraced it with all the strength of a matured mind and life. All the 
more intelligible, therefore, is his vehement anger with any form of Christian 
precept and practice, whether at Rome or Carthage, which fell short of his 
ideal. The church was to him the Virgin and spotless Bride of the Ascended Lord, 
and her children--bishops, priests, and people--must worthily reflect her purity 
and faith. He would permit no shortcomings because he would admit no failure. A 
writer of the 4th cent. has left on record that the Africans as he knew them 
were "faithless and cunning. There might be some good people among them, but 
they were not many" (quoted in Mommsen, <I>The Provinces of the Roman 
Empire</I>, ii. p. 340). This estimate is reflected a century earlier in 
Tertullian's pages. It is a summary of his opinion of the spurious devotion 
which marked the Christian fop (<I>de Poenit.</I> c. xi.; cf. <I>de Cultu 
Fem.</I> ii. c. viii.), the would-be penitent (<I>de Poenit.</I> c. ix.), the 
rich Christian lady (<I>de Cultu Fem.</I> i. c, ix., ii. cc. v.-vii.; <I>de 
Virg. Vel.</I> c. xvii.), the fashionable virgin (<I>ib.</I> c. xii.; in 
contrast with her holy sister, c. xv.), the drugged and petted martyr (<I>de 
Jej.</I> c. xii., in contrast with the willing and happy martyr, <I>ad 
Martyres</I>, cc. i.-iii.); and it explains that final revulsion of mind which, 
spurning every kind of compromise, heaped indiscriminate abuse on what was best 
as well as what was worst in the life of the Christians of the church, and 
turned to find in asceticism and Montanism a seriousness and elevation 
impossible to him elsewhere. Paradoxical as it may seem, it was the same 
impulsive spirit which kept him staunch to the faith of that church whose 
discipline and ritual he abjured or carried with him to a schismatic body. 
Gnosticism was to Tertullian the embodiment of theological corruption, darkness, 
and falsehood, and he fought it with all his natural vehemence. His theology, if 
developed by Montanism, is in substance that which the church accepted, and 
accepts. The admiration felt for his writings by his countryman Cyprian 
(200-258), bp. of Carthage, should never be forgotten. Cyprian, says St. Jerome, 
never passed a day without reading a portion of Tertullian's works; he 
frequently asked for them with the words, "Da mihi magistrum"; and it is 
impossible to read Cyprian's existing treatises without seeing how largely the 
thoughts of Tertullian have been absorbed by him, if the language has been 
softened and deepened. In our own country Bp. Bull (<I>Defensio Fidei 
Nicenae</I>) and Pearson (<I>On the Creed</I>) have used many an argument which 
the Montanist of Africa had prepared for them, and Bp. Kaye's illustrations of 
the Articles of the Church of England from Tertullian's writings (pp. 246, etc.) 
concur in establishing the force of Möhler's description of his dogma as "so 
homelike" (<I>Patr</I>. i. p. 737). It is based on the teaching of Christ as 
handed down by apostles and apostolic men, and formulated in the "regula fidei 
una, sola, immobilis et irreformabilis" (cf. <I>de Praes. Haer.</I> cc. viii. 
ix.; <I>de Virg. Vel.</I> c. i.). Theology owes practically to him such words 
(<I>int. al.</I>) as <I>Trinitas, satisfactio, sacramentum, substantia, persona, 
liberum arbitrium</I>, transferred (some of them) from the Latin law courts to 
take their definite place in the language of Latin divinity (cf. the <I>index 
verborum</I> at the end of Oehler, vol. ii.).
<P></P>
<P id=iii.xx.vi.p9.4>(c) <I>Tertullian, the Man.</I>--Of no one, says Ebert, is 
Buffon's saying truer, "the style is the man," and the best illustration of his 
style he finds in the <I>Apology</I> (<I>Geschichte der Christlich-Lateinischen 
Literatur</I>, pp. 34-37). Tertullian cared nothing for form save as it best 
expressed his thought. He said right out from his heart what he had to say about 
friend or foe, without attempt to clothe his speech with the graceful charm of 
the Greek or the dignified periods of the Roman. Abrupt and impetuous, eloquent 
and stern, his sentences follow one another with the sweeping, rushing force of 
storm-waves. The very exceptions do but prove the. rule. Such tender or 
beautiful passages as those which depict the life of Christ on earth (<I>de 
Pat.</I> c. iii.; <I>Apol.</I> c. xxi.; were these written with any acquaintance 
with the Life of the pagan Christ, Apollonius of Tyana, edited by Philostratus 
at the command of Julia Domna?), the power and effect of prayer (<I>de Orat.</I> 
c. xxix.), the virtues and portrait of patience (<I>de Pat.</I> c. xv.), 
contemporary civilization (<I>de Anima</I>, c. xxx.), the happy marriage (<I>ad 
Uxor.</I> ii. 8), and faith, the barque of the church (<I>de Idol.</I> c. 
xxiv.); or the impressive analogies of the resurrection he finds in nature 
(<I>re Resurr. Carnis</I>, c. xii.), </I>and the illustrations of the Trinity 
(<I>adv. Prax.</I> c. viii.), </I>come upon the reader as a surprise, as 
something so unlike one who is more in his recognized element when describing 
the place-hunter (<I>de Poenit.</I> c. xi.), the traitor (<I>Apol.</I> c. 
xxxv.), and the knowing Valentinian (<I>adv. Val.</I> end), or painting that 
ghastliest of his portraits, murder and idolatry crooning over adultery (<I>de 
Pud.</I> c. v.). His paradoxes are characteristic: To him the unity of heretics 
was schism (<I>de Praes. Haer.</I> c. xlii.); and heresy itself "tantum valeat 
quantum si non fuisset" (<I>ib.</I> c. i.). "God is great when little" (<I>adv. 
Marc.</I> ii. c. ii.); "Lie to be true " (<I>de Virg. Vel.</I> c. xvi.), contain 
thoughts only a shade less startling than the "Mortuus est Dei Filius; prorsus 
credibile est quia ineptum est; et sepultus resurrexit; certum est. quia 
impossibile est" (<I>de Carne Christi</I>, c. v.), or the well-known "the blood 
of martyrs is the seed of the church" (<I>Apol</I>. c. i.). His right 
appreciation of the methods of Scripture

exegesis 


<i>(de Pud. c. ix.; cf</i>


. 


<i>de Res. Carn.
</i>


c. xxi.) is found side by side with such signal
examples of perverse interpretation as those
which disfigure the 


<i>de Jejunio </i>


and 


<i>de Pudicitia, </i>


or such fanciful expositions as his view
of the cross 


<i>(adv. Marc. iii. c. </i>


xviii. ; cf. 


<i>adv.
Jud. cc. x. </i>


xiii.), St. Peter and the sword 


<i>(de
Idol. c. </i>


xix.), God&#39;s Voice to Adam 


<i>(adv.
Marc. ii. </i>


e. xxv.), and the phoenix 


<i>(de Res.
Carn. c. xiii.). </i>


Such paradoxes, contrasts,
and contradictions are characteristic indications not so much of a want of comprehensiveness as of a determination to occupy himself
with but one idea or one aspect of a great
truth, and subjugate to that the wider bearings of the question. His great acuteness,
power, eloquence, and causticity are concentrated for the time being upon a single principle ; and whatever will illustrate it, prove
it, and drive it home, is drawn into its service,
often regardless of its fitness (see this drawn
out in Pusey&#39;s pref. to 


<i>Libr. of the Fath. </i>


<i>Vol. </i>


x.)
Tertullian&#39;s style is strongly marked by the
early training of his life : it is juridical 


in


thought, language, and exposition-a fact
which explains so much of its difficulty. The
advocate is always present. His conduct of
the contest between Christianity and heathenism is that of a. law-court contest, God v. the
devil; his conception of the contest between
Montanist and Churchman is that of one who
asserted and developed Christianity v. one
who surrendered it or left it defective. Tertullian was often wrong, and the church has,
with sorrow, so adjudged him; but the character of the man explains everything.

</p>
<p>

What that character was he has himself
told: " Miserrimus ego, semper aeger caloribus impatientiae " (de 


<i>Pat. c. </i>


i.). The
sentence, caught up by Jerome, explained&#39;to
him the man (" homo acris et vehementis
ingenii "), as it explains his secession to
Montanism and his intellectual and moral
defects. Perverse in the sense of wrongheaded he often was in his narrow estimates,
but he was never wrong-hearted. His life and
work, full of the shades and contrasts of one
who loved well and hated well, were after all
a life and a work from which more has been
gained than lost. If Hilary can regret that
his "later error took-away from the authority
of what he had written," Vincentius can
remind us that those writings were " thunderbolts " ; they were hurled forth in defence of
faith and practice. It will be to his earlier
life or less polemical treatises that the reader
will turn with Cyprian by preference, and in
the perverse impatience of his later life see at
once " the fire which kindles and the beacon
which warns " (Pusey).

a story, which he says he found in the archives
of Edessa, that after the ascension of our
Lord, the apostle Judas Thomas sent Thad
daeus, one of the seventy disciples, to Edessa,
to king Abgarus the Black, and that he cured
the king of a serious illness, converted him
with all his people to Christianity, and died
at Edessa after many years of successful
labours. The name of this apostle of the
Edessenes is given by the Syrians as Addaeus

ed. Phillips, p. g, Eng.

misread the name as Thaddaeus. Thaddaeus
was at a later date contused with the apostle

Eusebius contain acorrespondence betweenAb
