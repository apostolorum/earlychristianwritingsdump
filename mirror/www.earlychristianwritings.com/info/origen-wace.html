<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1><B>Origenes.</B> <I>Sources.</I>--The main authority for the 
details of Origen's Life is Eusebius (<I>H. E.</I> vi.), who collected upwards 
of 100 letters of Origen (<I>ib.</I> 36). These, together with official 
documents (<I>ib.</I> 23, 33) and information from those acquainted with Origen 
(<I>ib.</I> 2, 33), formed the basis of his narrative. His account of the most 
critical period of Origen's life, his retirement from Alexandria, was given in 
bk. ii. of his <I>Apology</I>, which he composed with the help of Pamphilus 
(<I>ib.</I> 23). This unhappily has not been preserved.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.1>Origen's own writings give but few details of his life. But 
the loss of his letters is irreparable. They would have given a fuller picture 
of the man, even if they gave little additional information on the outward 
circumstances of his life.</P>

<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.3>His life and doctrine have been discussed, with special

siècles</I> (1858-1877); Boehringer, <I>Kirchengesch. in Biogr. Klemens u. 
Origenes</I> (1869, 2<SUP>te</SUP> Aufl.).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.4><I>Life.</I>--Origen was probably born at Alexandria (Eus. 
<I>H. E.</I> vi. 1), but whether of Egyptian, Greek, or mixed descent is not 
known. The loose phrase of Porphyry, that he "was a Greek and reared in Greek 
studies" (<I>ib.</I> 19), is in itself of little value, but the name of his 
father (Leonides) points in the same direction. His mother's name has not been 
preserved. May she have been of Jewish descent? He is said to have learnt Hebrew 
so well that in singing the psalms "he vied with his mother" (Hieron. <I>Ep.</I> 
39 [22], § 1).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.5>Origen's full name was Origenes Adamantius. Origenes was 
the name of one contemporary philosopher of distinction, and occurs elsewhere. 
Adamantius has commonly been regarded as an epithet describing Origen's 
unconquerable endurance, or for the invincible force of his arguments. But the 
language of Eusebius (<I>H. E.</I> vi. 14) and of Jerome (<I>de Vir. Ill.</I> 
54, "Origenes qui et Adamantius") shews that it was a second name, and not a 
mere adjunct. His father, Leonides, suffered martyrdom in the persecution of the 
10th year of Severus (202), and Origen had not then completed his 17th year 
(Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 2). He must have been born therefore A.D. 185-186, a date 
consistent with the statement (<I>ib.</I> vii. 1) that he died in his 69th year, 
in the reign of Gallus (A.D. 251-254). In Origen we have the first record of a 
Christian boyhood, and he was "great from the cradle." His education was 
superintended by his father, who especially directed him to the study of 
Scripture. The child's eager inquiries into the deeper meaning of the words he 
committed to memory caused perplexity to his father, who, while openly checking 
his son's premature curiosity, silently thanked God for the promise he gave for 
the future. Origen became the pupil of Pantaenus (after his return from India) 
and Clement, in whose school he met Alexander, afterwards bp. of Jerusalem 
(<I>ib.</I> vi. 14), with whom he then laid the foundation of that life-long 
friendship which supported him in his sorest trials.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.6>When Leonides was thrown into prison, Origen wished to 
share his fate, but was hindered by his mother. He addressed a letter to his 
father--his first recorded writing, still extant in the time of Eusebius--in 
which he prayed him to allow no thought for his family to shake his resolution. 
This shews the position of influence which Origen already enjoyed in his family. 
Leonides was put to death and his property confiscated. Upon this the young 
Origen seems to have fulfilled the promise his words implied. Partly by the 
assistance of a pious and wealthy lady, and partly by teaching, he supported 
himself and (as may be concluded) his mother and brothers. Already he collected 
a library. At first he gave lessons in literature; but as the Christian school 
was without a teacher, all having been scattered by the persecution, he was 
induced to give instruction in the faith. Thus in his 18th year he was, at first 
informally, the head of the Christian school in Alexandria in a season of 
exceptional danger. He was so successful that Demetrius, bp. of Alexandria, soon 
definitely committed to him the office. The charge decided the tenor of his 
life. Origen henceforth devoted himself exclusively to the office of a Christian 
teacher, and to ensure his independence sold his collection of classical writers 
for an annuity of four oboli (sixpence) a day, on which he lived for many years, 
refusing the voluntary contributions his friends offered him (<I>ib.</I> 3). His 
position is a remarkable illustration of the freedom of the early church. He was 
a layman and yet recognized as a leading teacher. His work was not confined to 
any district. Numbers of men and women flocked to his lectures, attracted partly 
by his stern simplicity of life, which was a guarantee of his sincerity. For he 
resolved to fulfil without reserve the precepts of the Gospel. For many years he 
went barefoot, wore only a single robe (Matt. x. 10), and slept upon the ground. 
His food and sleep were rigorously limited (<I>ib.</I>). Nor did his unmeasured 
zeal stop here. In the same spirit of sacrifice he applied to himself literally 
the words of Matt. xix. 12, though wishing to conceal the act from most of his 
friends. Origen's own comment on the words of the Gospel which he had 
misunderstood is a most touching confession of his error (<I>in Matt.</I> t. xv, 
1 ff.). But for the time the purpose of the act was accepted as its excuse.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.7>For 12 or 13 years he was engaged in these happy and 
successful labours; and it was probably during this period that he formed and 
partly executed his plan of a comparative view of the LXX with other Greek 
versions of O.T. and with the original Hebrew text, though the work was slowly 
elaborated as fresh materials came to his hands (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 16). A 
short visit to Rome in the time of Zephyrinus, to see "the most ancient church 
of the Romans" (<I>ib.</I> 14), and an authoritative call to Arabia (<I>ib.</I> 
19) alone seem to have interrupted his labours. Persecution tested the fruit of 
his teaching. He had the joy of seeing martyrs trained in his school; and his 
own escapes from the violence of the people were held to be due to the special 
protection of Providence (<I>ib.</I> 4, f. 3). During the same period he devoted 
himself with renewed vigour to the study of non-Christian thought, and attended 
the lectures of Ammonius Saccas (cf. Porphyry, <I>ap.</I> Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 
19; Theod. <I>Graec. Affect. Cur.</I> vi. p. 96). Heretics and Gentiles attended 
his lectures, and he felt bound to endeavour to understand their opinions 
thoroughly that he might the better correct them (cf. <I>c. Cels.</I> vi. 24). 
This excited ill-will, but he was able to defend himself, as he did in a letter 
written at a later time (<I>Ep.</I> ap. Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 19), by the 
example of his predecessors and the support of his friends.His work grew beyond

school. Heraclas had been one of his first converts and scholars, and the 
brother of a martyr (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 3). He was a fellow-student with 
Origen under "his teacher of philosophy" (Ammonius Saccas); and when he 
afterwards became bp. of Alexandria he did not lay aside the dress or the 
reading of a philosopher (<I>ib.</I> 19).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.8>At length, <I>c.</I> 215, a tumult of unusual violence 
(<I>ib.</I> 19; Clinton, <I>Fasti Romani</I>, i. 224 f.) forced Origen to 
withdraw from Egypt to Caesarea in Palestine. Here his reputation brought him 
into a prominence which occasioned his later troubles. His fellow-pupil 
Alexander bp. of Jerusalem, and Theoctistus (Theotecnus; Photius, <I>Cod.</I> 
118) bp. of Caesarea, begged him to expound the Scriptures in the public 
services of the church, though he had not been ordained. Demetrius of Alexandria 
expressed strong disapprobation of a proceeding he described as unprecedented. 
Alexander and Theoctistus produced precedents. Demetrius replied by recalling 
Origen to Alexandria, and hastened his return by special envoys, deacons of the 
church (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 19). Origen's stay in Palestine was of some 
length, and it was probably during this time he made his famous visit to Mamaea, 
the mother of the emperor Alexander (<I>ib.</I> 21), herself a native of 
Syria.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.9>Some time after his return to Alexandria (<I>c.</I> 219), 
Origen began his written expositions of Scripture, largely through the influence 
of Ambrose, whom he had rescued not long before from the heresy of Valentinus, 
or as Jerome says of Marcion (Hieron. <I>de Vir. Ill.</I> 56). Ambrose provided 
him with more than seven shorthand writers (<FONT face=symbol>tacugrafoi</FONT>) 
to take down his comments and other scribes to make fair copies (Eus. <I>H. 
E.</I> vi. 23).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.10>These literary occupations threw Origen's work in the 
catechetical school yet more upon Heraclas. At the same time the first parts of 
Origen's <I>Commentary on the Gospel of St. John</I> marked him out more 
decisively than before as a teacher in the church even more than in the school. 
But the exhibition of this new power was accompanied by other signs of a bold 
originality which might well startle those unfamiliar with the questionings of 
philosophy. The books <I>On First Principles</I>, which seem to have been 
written spontaneously, made an epoch in Christian speculation, as the <I>Comm. 
on St. John</I> did in Christian interpretation. Under such circumstances it is 
not surprising that Demetrius yielded, in the words of Eusebius, to the 
infirmity of human nature (<I>ib.</I> 8) and wished to check the boldness and 
influence of the layman. It became clear that Origen must seek elsewhere than in 
Alexandria free scope for his Scriptural studies. After he had laboured there 
for more than 25 years, the occasion came in an invitation to visit Achaia for 
the purpose, as it seems, of combating some false opinions which had arisen 
there (Hieron. <I>de Vir. Ill.</I> 54). The exact date is uncertain, but 
probably between 226 and 230. On the way Origen visited Caesarea, and sought 
counsel from his oldest friends as to his future course. No record remains of 
their deliberations, but Origen was ordained presbyter "by the bishops there" 
(Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 23), Theoctistus of Caesarea and Alexander of Jerusalem 
(Hieron. <I>de Vir. Ill.</I> 54; Phot. <I>Cod.</I> 118). Origen then visited 
Ephesus (<I>Ep. Fragm.</I> ap. Ruf. <I>Apol.</I>, Delarue, i. p. 6) and stayed 
some time at Athens. During this stay he probably heard some of the teachers of 
philosophy there (Epiph. <I>Haer.</I> lxiv. 1). At length, having completed his 
mission, he returned to Alexandria, where he could not have been unprepared for 
the reception which awaited him from Demetrius. Demetrius had probably shewn 
clear unwillingness to admit him to the priesthood. At any rate, the fact that 
Origen received orders from Palestinian bishops without his consent might be 
construed as a direct challenge of his authority. Origen at once perceived that 
he must retire before the rising storm. The preface to bk. vi. of the <I>Comm. 
on St. John</I> shews how deeply he felt the severance of old ties and the 
hostility of former colleagues. In 231 he left Alexandria never to return; and 
his influence to the last is shewn by the fact that he "left the charge of the 
catechetical school" to his coadjutor Heraclas (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 26). It is 
difficult to trace the different stages in the condemnation which followed. 
Photius (<I>Cod.</I> 118), following the <I>Apology</I> of Pamphilus and 
Eusebius, gives the most intelligible and consistent account. According to him 
Demetrius, completely alienated from Origen by his ordination, collected a synod 
of "bishops and a few presbyters," which decided that Origen should not be 
allowed to stay or teach at Alexandria. Demetrius afterwards excommunicated 
Origen. Jerome describes with greater severity the spirit of Demetrius's 
proceedings, and adds that "he wrote on the subject to the whole world" (<I>de 
Vir. Ill.</I> 54) and obtained a judgment against Origen from Rome (<I>Ep.</I> 
33 [29], § 4). So far the facts are tolerably clear, but in the absence of 
trustworthy evidence it is impossible to tell on what points the condemnation 
really turned. Demetrius unquestionably laid great stress on formal 
irregularities (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 8), and the sentence against him may have 
been based on these. Origen's opinions were probably displeasing to many, and no 
attempt was made to reverse the judgment after the death of Demetrius, which 
followed very shortly, and perhaps within three years, when Heraclas, the pupil 
and colleague of Origen, succeeded to the episcopate. Nor again was anything 
done by Dionysius, the successor of Heraclas, another devoted scholar of Origen, 
who still continued his intercourse with his former master (<I>ib.</I> 46). 
Whatever the grounds of Origen's condemnation, the judgment of the Egyptian 
synod was treated with absolute disregard by the bishops of Palestine, Arabia, 
Phoenicia, and Achaea (Hieron. <I>Ep.</I> 33), and Origen defended himself 
warmly (Hieron. <I>Apol. adv. Ruf.</I> ii. 18). He soon afterwards settled at 
Caesarea, which became for more than 20 years, up to his death, the centre of 
his labours. It had indeed not a few of the advantages of Alexandria, as a great 
seaport, the civil capital, and the ecclesiastical metropolis of its 
district.</P>

devoted to him; and Firmilian of Caesarea in Cappadocia was no less zealous in 
seeking his instruction (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 27; Hieron. <I>de Vir. Ill.</I> 
54). Ambrose was with him to stimulate his literary efforts. He formed afresh 
something of a catechetical school, with a continual succession of distinguished 
students. He was unwearied in the public exposition of Scripture, which he 
explained popularly to mixed congregations in the church, to Christians and to 
catechumens (<I>Hom. in Ezech.</I> vi. 5), as a rule on Wednesdays and Fridays 
(Socr. <I>H. E.</I> v. 22), but often daily, and even oftener than once a day. 
His subjects were sometimes taken from the lessons (<I>Hom. in Num.</I> xv. 1; 
<I>in I. Sam.</I> ii. § 1), sometimes specially prescribed by an authoritative 
request (<I>Hom. to Ezech.</I> xiii. 1). His aim was the edification of the 
people generally (<I>Hom. in Lev.</I> vii. 1; <I>in Jud.</I> viii. 3); and not 
unfrequently he was constrained to speak, as he wrote, with some reserve, on the 
deeper mysteries of the faith (<I>Hom. in Num.</I> iv. 3; <I>in Lev.</I> xiii. 
3; <I>in Ezech.</I> i. 3; <I>in Rom.</I> vii. 13, p. 147 L.; viii. 11, p. 272; 
cf. <I>Hom. in Jos.</I> xxiii. 4 <I>s. f.</I>; <I>in Gen.</I> xii. 1, 4).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.12>These labours were interrupted by the persecution of 
Maximin (235-237). Ambrose and Protectetus, a presbyter of Caesarea, were among 
the victims. Origen addressed to them in prison his <I>Exhortation to 
Martyrdom</I>. He himself escaped (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 28). During part of the 
time of persecution he was apparently with Firmilian in Cappadocia, and is said 
to have there enjoyed the hospitality of a Christian lady Juliana, who had some 
books of Symmachus, the translator of O.T. (cf. Hieron. <I>l.c.</I>; Pallad. 
<I>Hist. Laus.</I> 147).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.13>In 238, or perhaps 237, Origen was again at Caesarea, and 
Gregory (Thaumaturgus) delivered the <I>Farewell Address</I>, which is the most 
vivid picture left of the method and influence of the great Christian master. 
The scholar recounts, with touching devotion, the course along which he had been 
guided by the man to whom he felt he owed his spiritual life. He had come to 
Syria to study Roman law in the school of Berytus, but on his way met with 
Origen, and at once felt he had found in him the wisdom he was seeking. The day 
of that meeting was to him, in his own words, the dawn of a new being: his soul 
clave to the master whom he recognized and he surrendered himself gladly to his 
guidance. As Origen spoke, he kindled within the young advocate's breast a love 
for the Holy Word, and for himself the Word's herald. "This love," Gregory adds, 
"induced me to give up country and friends, the aims which I had proposed to 
myself, the study of law of which I was proud. I had but one passion, 
philosophy, and the godlike man who directed me in the pursuit of it" (c. 
6).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.14>Origen's first care, Gregory says, was to make the 
character of a pupil his special study. In this he followed the example of 
Clement (Clem. <I>Strom.</I> i. 1, 8, p. 320 P.). He ascertained, with delicate 
and patient attention, the capacities, faults, and tendencies of those he had to 
teach. Rank growths of opinion were cleared away; weaknesses were laid open; 
every effort was used to develop endurance, firmness, patience, thoroughness. 
"In true Socratic fashion he sometimes overthrew us by argument," Gregory 
writes, "if he saw us restive and starting out of the course. . . . The process 
was at first disagreeable to us and painful; but so he purified us . . . and . . 
. prepared us for the reception of the words of truth . . . by probing us and 
questioning us, and offering problems for our solution" (c. 7). Thus Origen 
taught his scholars to regard language as designed, not to furnish material for 
display, but to express truth with exact accuracy; and logic as powerful, not to 
secure a plausible success, but to test beliefs with the strictest rigour. 
Origen then led his pupils to the "lofty and divine and most lovely" study of 
external nature. He made geometry the sure and immovable foundation of his 
teaching, and rose step by step to the heights of heaven and the most sublime 
mysteries of the universe (c. 8). Gregory's language implies that Origen was 
himself a student of physics; as, in some degree, the true theologian must be. 
The lessons of others, he writes, or his own observation, enabled him to explain 
the connexion, the differences, the changes of the objects of sense. Such 
investigations served to shew man in his true relation to the world. A rational 
feeling for the vast grandeur of the external order, "the sacred economy of the 
universe," as Gregory calls it, was substituted for the ignorant and senseless 
wonder with which it is commonly regarded.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.15>But physics were naturally treated by Origen as a 
preparation and not as an end. Moral science came next; and here he laid the 
greatest stress upon the method of experiment. His aim was not merely to analyse 
and to define and to classify feelings and motives, though he did this, but to 
form a character. For him ethics were a life, and not only a theory. The four 
cardinal virtues of Plato, practical wisdom, self-control, righteousness, 
courage, seemed to him to require for their maturing diligent introspection and 
culture. Herein he gave a commentary upon his teaching. His discipline lay even 
more in action than in precept. His own conduct was, in his scholar's minds, a 
more influential persuasive than his arguments.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.16>So, Gregory continues, Origen was the first teacher who 
really led me to the pursuit of Greek philosophy, by bringing speculation into a 
vital union with practice. In him I saw the inspiring example of one at once 
wise and holy. The noble phrase of older masters gained a distinct meaning for 
the Christian disciple. In failure and weakness he was able to see that the end 
of all was "to become like to God with a pure mind, and to draw near to Him and 
to abide in Him" (c. 12).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.17>Guarded and guided by this conviction, Origen encouraged 
his scholars in theology to look for help in all the works of human genius. They 
were to examine the writings of philosophers and poets of every nation, the 
atheists alone excepted, with faithful candour and wise catholicity. For them 
there was to be no sect, no party. In their arduous work they had ever at hand, 
in their master, a friend who knew their difficulties. If they were bewildered 
in the tangled mazes of conflicting<PB id=Page_773 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y"

if in danger of being swallowed up in the quicksands of shifting error, he was 
near to lift them up to the sure resting-place he had himself found (c. 14).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.18>The hierarchy of sciences was not completed till theology 
with her own proper gifts crowned the succession followed hitherto, logic, 
physic, ethics. Origen found in the Holy Scriptures and the teaching of the 
Spirit the final and absolute spring of Divine Truth. In this region Gregory 
felt his master's power to be supreme. Origen's sovereign command of the 
mysteries of "the oracles of God" gave him perfect boldness in dealing with all 
other writings. "Therefore," Gregory adds, "there was no subject forbidden to 
us, nothing hidden or inaccessible. We were allowed to become acquainted with 
every doctrine, barbarian or Greek, on things spiritual or civil, divine and 
human; traversing with all freedom, and investigating the whole circuit of 
knowledge, and satisfying ourselves with the full enjoyment of all the pleasures 
of the soul " (c. 15). Such was, Gregory tells us, Origen's method. He describes 
what he knew and what his hearers knew. There is no parallel to the picture in 
ancient times. With every allowance for the partiality of a pupil, the view it 
offers of a system of Christian training actually realized exhibits a type we 
cannot hope to surpass. The ideals of Christian education and of Christian 
philosophy were fashioned together. Under that comprehensive and loving 
discipline Gregory, already trained in heathen schools, first learnt, step by 
step, according to his own testimony, what the pursuit of philosophy truly was, 
and came to know the solemn duty of forming opinions not as the amusement of a 
moment, but as solid foundations of life-long work.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.19>From Caesarea Origen visited different parts of Palestine: 
Jerusalem, Jericho, the valley of the Jordan (t. vi. <I>in Joh.</I> § 24); 
Sidon, where he made some stay (<I>Hom. in Josh.</I> xvi. § 2), partly at least 
to investigate "the footsteps of Jesus, and of His disciples, and of the 
prophets" (<I>in Joh. l.c.</I>). He also went again to Athens and continued 
there some time, being engaged on his Commentaries (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vi. 32). 
In the first of two visits to Arabia he went to confer with Beryllus of Bostra, 
who had advanced false views on the Incarnation (<I>ib.</I> 33); in the second 
to meet some errors on the doctrine of the resurrection (<I>ib.</I> 37). In both 
cases he was specially invited and persuaded those whom he controverted to 
abandon their opinions.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.20>His energy now rose to its full power. Till he was 60 
(A.D. 246) he had forbidden his unwritten discourses to be taken down. 
Experience at length enabled him to withdraw the prohibition, and most of his 
homilies are due to reports made afterwards. The <I>Books against Celsus</I> and 
the <I>Commentaries on St. Matthew</I>, belonging to the same period, shew, in 
different directions, the maturity of his vigour. Thus his varied activity 
continued till the persecution of Decius in 250. The preceding reign of Philip 
had favoured the growth of Christianity; and there is no sufficient reason to 
question the fact of Origen's correspondence with the emperor and his wife 
Severa (<I>ib.</I> 36). Such intercourse marked Origen out for attack to 
Philip's conqueror and successor. His friend Alexander of Jerusalem died in 
prison. He himself suffered a variety of tortures, probably at Tyre--chains, the 
iron collar, and the rack; but his constancy baffled all the efforts of his 
enemies (<I>ib.</I> 39). He was threatened with the stake, and a report gained 
currency in later times that his sufferings were crowned by death (Phot. 
<I>Cod.</I> 118, p. 159). During this sharp trial his former pupil Dionysius, 
now bp. of Alexandria, addressed him a letter on martyrdom (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> 
vi. 46), shewing the old affection still alive, in spite of long separation. 
Origen described his sufferings and consolations in letters which Eusebius 
characterizes "as full of help to those who need encouragement" (<I>ib.</I> 39). 
The death of Decius (251, Clinton, <I>F.R.</I> i. 270), after a reign of two 
years, set Origen free. But his health was broken by his hardships. He died at 
Tyre in 253, "having completed seventy years save one" (Eus. <I>H. E.</I> vii. 
1; Hieron. <I>Ep.</I> 65 <I>ad Pammach.</I>). He was buried there (William of 
Tyre, <I>c.</I> 1180, <I>Hist.</I> xiii. 1: "haec [Tyrus] et Origenis corpus 
occultat sicut oculata fide etiam hodie licet inspicere"), and his tomb was 
honoured as long as the city survived.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p1.21>Of the later fortunes of his teaching it is enough to say 
here that his fate after death was like his fate during life: he continued to 
witness not in vain to noble truths. His influence was sufficiently proved by 
the persistent bitterness of his antagonists, and there are few sadder pages in 
church history than the record of the Origenistic controversies. But in spite of 
errors easy to condemn, his characteristic thoughts survived in the works of 
Hilary and Ambrose and Jerome, and in his own homilies, to stir later students 
in the West. His homilies had a very wide circulation in the middle ages in a 
Latin translation; and it would be interesting to trace their effect upon 
medieval commentators down to Erasmus, who wrote to Colet in 1504: "Origenis 
operum bonam partem evolvi; quo praeceptore mihi videor non-nullum fecisse 
operae pretium; aperit enim fontes quosdam et rationes indicat artis 
theologicae."</P>

One of the fragments of the Commentary on
Genesis contains a remarkable discussion of
the theory of fate in connexion with Gen. i. 16 ;
and in the scattered notes there are some
characteristic remarks on the interpretation
of the record. of Creation. For Origen all
Creation was " one act at once," presented
to us in parts., in order to give the due conception of order (cf. Ps. cxlviii. 5). The
Homilies deal mainly with the moral application of main subjects in the book. They
contain little continuous exposition, but
many striking thoughts. Among the passages
of chief interest are the view of the Divine
image and the: Divine likeness as expressing
man&#39;s endownnent and man&#39;s end (i. &sect;&sect; 12,
I3), the symbolism of the ark (ii. &sect;&sect; 4 ff.),
the nature of the Divine voice (iii. &sect; z), the

of the Divine priesthood (xvi. &sect; 5).

The main fragment of the Commentary on
Exodus (Philoc. 27 [26]) deals with interpretation of the " hardening of Pharaoh&#39;s
heart " (Ex. x. 2y), which Origen (to use
modern language) finds in the action of moral
laws, while Pharaoh resisted the divine teaching. The Homilies, like those on Genesis,
were translated by Rufinus from the reports of
Origen s sermons, which he supplemented with
interpretative additions. Throughout Origen
dwells upon the spiritual interpretation of the
record. " Not one iota or one tittle is," in his
opinion, " without mysteries" <I>(Hom. i. </I>4).
The literal history has a mystical and a moral
meaning <I>(e.g. flom. f. </I>4 f., ii. 


I 


iii. 3, iv, 8,
vii. 3, x. 4, x:iii. 5). Some of the applications he makes are of great beauty, <I>e.g. </I>in
regard to the popular complaints against
religious life and the troubles which follow
religious awakening (Ex. v. 4 ff., <I>Hom. iii. </I>3) ;
the difficulties of the heavenward pilgrimage
(Ex. xiv. 2, <I>Hom. v. </I>3) ; the believer as the

One main idea is prominent throughout.
The struggles of the Israelites on the way to
Canaan are the image of the struggles of the

The homilies on Joshua, belonging to the
latest period of Origen&#39;s life, perhaps offer the
most attractive specimen of his popular interpretation. The parallel between the leader
of the old church and the Leader of the new
is drawn with great ingenuity and care. The
spiritual interpretation of the conquest of
Canaan, as an image of the Christian life, never
flags. Fact after fact is made contributory
to the fulness of the idea; and the reader &#39;is

forced to acknowledge that the fortunes of
Israel can at least speak to us with an intelligible voice. Rufinus himself may have felt
the peculiar charm of the book, for he selected
it for translation in answer to a general request of Chromatius to render something from
Greek literature for the edification of the
church. The homilies cover the whole narrative up to the settling of the land (c. xxii.).

before he left Alexandria. At that time he

He completed the book
afterwards. Jerome expressly states that he
" left an explanation of all the Psalms in many
volumes" <I>(Ep. cxii. </I>&sect;2o) ; and his extant books
contain numerous references to his commentaries on psalms (cf. Hier. <I>E&cent;. xxxiv. </I>

The Homilies generally give a full interpretation of the text, accommodating the
language of the prophet to the circumstances
of the Christian church. But Origen&#39;s total
want of historical feeling makes itself felt
perhaps more in his treatment of this book
than elsewhere, for the teaching of Jeremiah
is practically unintelligible without a true
sense of the tragic crisis in which he was
placed. There are, however, many separate
passages of the Homilies of considerable

beauty, e.g. on the fruitful discipline of God

and the doubtful question as to " the
brethren of the Lord " (c. I7). On internal
grounds he favours the belief in the perpetual
virginity of the mother of the Lord. In the
account of Herod&#39;s banquet he has preserved
definitely the fact that " the daughter of
Herodias " bore the same name as her mother
(c. zz), in accordance with the true reading in
Mark vi. 


<I>22 (rtes Ovyarpds airrov &#39;HpW8td8os) ;

the

even in His chastisements (c.

remarkable interpretations of the five sendings of labourers to the vineyard (Matt. xx.

who had wrought as an apostle in one hour
more perhaps than all those before him (c.

Bk. xvi. (xx. I7-xxi.

gives some striking
pictures of the darker side of Christian society,
the growing pride of the hierarchy, the faults
of church officers, the separation between
clergy and laity (cc. 


<I>8, zz, 25). </I>


In discussing
the healing of Bartimaeus Origen holds that a
choice must be made between supposing that
the three evangelists have related three incidents, if the literal record is to be maintained, or that they relate one and the same
spiritual fact in different words (c. 


<I>I2).</I>

</P>
<P>

Bk. xvii. 


<I>(xxi. 23-xxii. 33) </I>


contains interpretations of the parables of the two sons
(c. 4), the vineyard (6 ff.), and the marriage
feast (I5 ff.), which are good examples of
Origen&#39;s method; and his explanations of the
questions of the Herodians (cc. 26 ff.) and the
Sadducees (c. 33) are of interest.

from which the detached notes

The remains of the Commentary on St. John
are in many respects the most important of
Origen&#39;s exegetical writings. There are left

</P>
<P>

Tbyot i. ii. (iv. v. small fragments), vi. x. xiii.
xix. (nearly entire), xx. xxviii. xxxii. These
remains extend over the following portions of
the Gospel: T. i. (John i. ra), ii. (i. rb-7a),
vi. (i. r9-29), x. (ii. r2-25), xiii. (iv. r3-44),
xix. (part) (viii. r9-24), xx. (viii. 37-52),
xxviii. (xi- 39-57), xxxii. (xiii. 2-33). A revised text with critical intro. by A. E. Brooke
has been pub. in 2 vols. by the Camb. Univ.
Press.

</P>
<P>

The Commentary on St. John was undertaken at the request of Ambrose (in. 


<I>Joh. </I>


t.
i. &sect;&sect; 3, 6), and was " the first-fruits of his
labours at Alexandria " (ib


<I>. &sect; 4</I>


). It marks an
epoch in theological literature and thought.
Perhaps the earlier work of 


HERACLEON 


may
have suggested the idea, but Origen implies
that the Gospel, by its essential character,
claimed his first efforts as an interpreter.

</P>
<P>

Bk. i. deals mainly with the fundamental
conceptions of " the Gospel " (&sect;&sect; r-r5), " the
beginning" (&sect;&sect; r6-22), and "the Logos"
(&sect;&sect; 19-42). The Gospels are the first-fruits
(daapX~) of the Scripture, the Gospel of St.
John is the first-fruits of the Gospels (&sect; 6). As
the Law had a shadow of the future, so too has
the Gospel: spiritua. - iths underlie historical
truths (&sect; 9). The Gosp, &#39; - the widest sense is
" for the whole world," not for our earth only,
but for the universal system of the heavens
and earth (&sect; r5). The discussion of the title
Logos marks a critical stage in the history of
Christian thought. In what sense, it is asked,
is the Saviour called the Logos ? It had
come to be a common opinion " that Christ
was as it were only a ` word &#39; of God " (&sect; 23).
To meet this view Origen refers to other titles,
Light, Resurrection, Way, Truth, etc. (&sect;&sect; 2441), and by analogy comes to the conclusion
that as we are illuminated by Christ as the
Light, and quickened by Him as the Resurrection, so we are made divinely rational by
Him as the Logos, 


<I>i.e. </I>


Reason (&sect; 42). He
thus preserves the personality of the Lord
under the title of Logos, which expresses one
aspect of His being and not His being itself
(as a word) ; but recognizes that Christ may
also be called the Logos (Word) of God as
giving expression to His will.

</P>
<P>

In bk. ii. he continues his discussion of the
meaning of the Logos, distinguishing, in a
remarkable passage (&sect; 2), God and Reason

taken absolutely 


(o 


Oe6s, 


o 


a6yos) from God
and Reason used as predicates (9ehs, Tbyos).
" The Father is the foundation of Deity, the
Son of Reason" (&sect; 3). Afterwards he discusses
the sense of the words "came into being
through Him (&amp;&#39; adro6)," and the relation of
the Holy Spirit to the Son (&sect; 6) ; and further,
what " all things," and what that is which is
called " nothing " (i


<I>.e. </I>


evil) which became
without Him but is not (&sect; 7). The conceptions of life and light, of darkness and death,
are then examined (&sect;&sect; ii ff.). In treating of
the mission of John (&sect;&sect; 24 ff.) Origen questions
whether he may not have been an angel who
sought to minister on earth to his Lord (&sect; 25) ;
and characteristically remarks that he was
" the voice " preceding " the Word " (&sect; 26).
Perhaps it is not less characteristic that he
blames those who, like Heracleon (t. vi. 


&sect; 2),


hold that John i. r6-r8 are the words of the
evangelist and not of the Baptist.

</P>
<P>

In bk. vi., after describing with calm dignity
the circumstances which had interrupted his
work, he examines in detail John i. r9-29.
The question, Art 


<I>thou Elias? </I>


leads to a remarkable discussion on the pre-existence of
souls, and the entrance of the soul into the
body, " a vast and difficult subject," which he
reserves for special investigation (&sect; 7). The
words of the Baptist (i. 26) give occasion for a
minute comparison with the parallels in the
other Gospels (&sect;&sect; 16 ff.), in the course of which
(&sect; 17) Origen strikingly contrasts the baptisms
of John and Christ, and explains Christ&#39;s presence " in the midst of the Jews " (v. 


26) 


of
His universal presence as the Logos (&sect; 


22).


The mention of Bethany (v. 


28) 


leads him to
hastily adopt the correction " Bethabara "


(&sect; 24), 


which he justifies by the frequent errors
as to names in the LXX. His brief exposition of the title of Christ " as the Lamb of
God " (&sect;&sect; 35 ff.) is full of interest; and in
connexion with this he notices the power of
the blood of martyrs to overcome evil (&sect; 


36).

</P>
<P>

Bk. x. deals with the history of the first
cleansing of the temple and its immediate
results (ii. 


r2-25). 


Origen thinks the discrepancy between the evangelists as to the
sojourn at Capernaum (v. 


12) 


is such that its
solution can be found only in the spiritual
sense (&sect; 


2), 


to which every minute point contributes, though in itself outwardly trivial and
unworthy of record (&sect;&sect; 


2 


ff.). The phrase
" the passover of <I>the Jews " leads </I>to an exposition of Christ as the true Passover (&sect;&sect; 


r 


i ff).
The cleansing of the temple is shewn to have
an abiding significance in life (&sect; 


16) 


; and
Origen thinks that the sign Christ offered is
fulfilled in the raising of the Christian church,
built of living stones, out of trials and death,
" after three days "-the first of present
suffering, the second of the consummation,
the third of the new order (&sect; 


20).

</P>
<P>

Bk. xiii. is occupied with the interpretation of part of the history of the Samaritan
woman and the healing of the nobleman&#39;s son
(iv. 


r3-54). 


It is chiefly remarkable for the
number of considerable quotations from Heracleon&#39;s Commentary it contains, more than
twice as many as the other books. These
still require careful collection and criticism.
Lommatzsch failed to fulfil the promise of his
preface (I. p. xiii.). Passages of interest in

regard to Origen&#39;s own views and method are
<P>



those on the relation of Christ&#39;s personal
teaching to the Scriptures (&sect; 5), the five
husbands as representing the senses (&sect; 9), the
incorporeity of God (&sect; 25), the joy of the
sower and reaper, and the continuity of work
(&sect;&sect; 46 f.), the unhonoured prophet (&sect; 54),
spiritual dependence (&sect; 58),and the distinction
between signs and wonders (&sect; 6o).

</P>
<P>

Of bk. xix., which is imperfect at the beginning and end, a considerable fragment
remains (viii. 19-25). The remarks on the
treasury (John viii. 2o) as the scene of the
Lord&#39;s discourses (&sect; 2), and on the power of
faith (&sect; 6), are characteristic.

</P>
<P>

Bk. xx. (viii. 37-53) has much that is of
importance for Origen&#39;s opinions. It begins
with an examination of some points in connexion with the pre-existence and character
of souls; and, in a striking passage (&sect; 29),
Origen illustrates the inspiration of evil passions. Other interesting passages treat of
love as " the sun " in the life of Christians
(&sect; 15); the ambiguities in the word " when "
(&sect; 24) ; the need of help for spiritual sight
(&sect; 26) ; and spiritual influences (&sect; 29).

</P>
<P>

The most remarkable passage in bk. xxviii.
(John xi- 39-57) is perhaps that on the power
of self-sacrifice among the Gentiles illustrating
the vicarious sufferings of Christ (&sect; 14). Other
remarks worthy of special notice are on the
lifting up of the eyes (John xi. 41) (&sect; 4), the
lesson of the death of Lazarus (&sect; 6), the duty
of prudence in. time of persecution (&sect; 18), and
the passover of the Jews and of the Lord (&sect; 2o).

</P>
<P>

Bk. xxxii. (John xiii. 2-33) treats of St.
John&#39;s record of the Last Supper. Origen
discusses the feet-washing at length, and says
that it is not to be perpetuated literally
(&sect;&sect; 6 f.) ; he dwells on the growth of faith (&sect; 9),
the difference of " soul " and " spirit " (&sect; I1


),


the character of Judas and moral deterioration (&sect; 12), and the sop given to Judas (&sect; 16).

</P>
<P>

Origen&#39;s Commentary is for us the beginning
of a new type of literature. It has great
faults of style, is diffusive, disproportioned,
full of repetitions, obscure and heavy in form
of expression, wholly deficient in historical
insight, and continually passing into fantastic
speculations. But it contains not a few
" jewels five words long," abounds in noble
thoughts and subtle criticisms, grapples with
great difficulties, unfolds great ideas, and,
above all, retains a firm hold on the human
life of the Lord.

tions. Origen&#39;s treatment

Rom.

represented by Rufinus, is, on the whole, disappointing. It might have been expected to
call out his highest powers of imagination

conjectures as to the persons named in Rom.

absence of any authoritative tradition as to
the persons of the early Roman church. For
the passage (x. 43) which refers to Marcion&#39;s

I.-Il. CORINTHIANS.-[II Homilies on II.
Cor.-H.c.] <I>Greek: </I>Jerome mentions (E&cent;. <I>ad
Pammach. xlix. &sect; 3</I>) that Origen commented
on this epistle at length; and Origen himself
refers to what he had said on I. Cor. i. 2 <I>(Hom.
in Luc. xvii. s. </I>f.). A very important collection
of notes on I. Cor. is given in Cramer&#39;s <I>Catena,
</I>vol. v. 1844. Some of the notes contain
passages of considerable interest, as those on
the vicarious death of Gentile heroes (I. Cor. i.
18 ; cf. <I>Hom. in Joh. </I>t. xxviii. &sect; 14), the
sovereignty of believers (I. Cor. iii. 21), evangelic " counsels " (vii. 25), the public teaching
of women (xiv. 34, with reference to Montanism). Origen gives the outline of a creed (i.
9, 20), and touches on baptism (i. 14) and
holy communion (vii. 5). He describes the
Jewish search for leaven (v. 7) ; and supposes
that many books of O.T. were lost at the
Captivity (ii. 9).

</P>
<P>

GALATIANS-[15 Books; 7 Homilies.H.c.] Jerome, in the Prologue to his Commentary on Galatians, mentions that Origen
wrote five Books on this epistle, as well as
various Homilies and Notes (tractatus et excer&cent;ta), and that he interpreted it with brief
annotations (commatico sermone) in his Stromateis, bk. x. (Proem. in Comm. ad Gal.; E&cent;.
ad August. cxi. &sect;&sect; 4, 6). Three fragments of
the Commentary are contained in the Latin
translation of Pamphilus&#39;s Apology.

</P>
<P>

EPHESIANS-[3 Books.-H.c.] Origen&#39;s
Commentary on the Ephesians may still be
practically recovered. Jerome, in the Prologue to his own Commentary, says that " his
readers should know that Origen wrote three
books on the epistle, which he had partly
followed." The extent of his debt could only
be estimated by conjecture, till the publication of the Paris Catena (Cramer, 1842). This
contains very large extracts from Origen&#39;s
commentary, sometimes with his name and
sometimes anonymous, and in nearly all cases
Jerome has corresponding words or thoughts.
A careful comparison of the Greek fragments
with J erome&#39;s Latin would make it possible
to reconstruct a very large part of Origen&#39;s
work. The corresponding notes on the description of the Christian warfare (vi. 


11 


ff.)
well illustrate Jerome&#39;s mode of dealing with
his archetype. Origen&#39;s comments are almost

Origen~tseqpinions. It was written while at
Alexandria, when he was probably not much
more than

years old and still a layman,
but there is no reason to think that he modified,
in any important respects, the views he unfolds in it. It was not written for simple
believers but for scholars-for those who
were familiar with the teaching of Gnosticism
and Platonism; and with a view to questions
which then first became urgent when men
have risen to a wide view of nature and life.
Non-Christian philosophers moved in a region
of subtle abstractions, " ideas " : Origen felt
that Christianity converted these abstractions
into realities, persons, facts of a complete
life; and he strove to express what he felt in
the modes of thought and language of his own
age. He aimed at presenting the highest


knowledge (yvwats) 


as an objective system.
But in doing this he had no intention of
fashioning two Christianities, a Christianity
for the learned and a Christianity for the
simple. The faith was one, one essentially

The book is the earliest attempt to form a
system of Christian doctrine, or rather a philosophy of the Christian faith, and thus marks
an epoch in Christian thought, but no change
in the contents of the Christian creed. The
elements of the dogmatic basis are assumed
on the authority of the church. The author&#39;s
object is, he says, to shew how they can be
arranged as a whole, by the help either of the
statements of Scripture or of the methods of
exact reasoning. However strange or startling the teaching of Origen may seem to us,
we must bear in mind that this is his own
account of it. He takes for granted that all
he brings forward is in harmony with received
teaching. He professes to accept as final the
same authorities as ourselves.

</P>
<P>

The treatise consists of four books. Digressions and repetitions interfere with the symmetry of the plan. But to speak generally,
bk. i. deals with God and creation (religious
statics) ; bks. ii. and iii. with creation and
providence, man and redemption (religious
dynamics); and bk. iv. with Holy Scripture.
The first three books contain the exposition
of a Christian philosophy, gathered round the
three ideas of God, the world, and the rational
soul, and the last gives the basis of it. Even
in the repetitions (as on " the restoration of
things ") each successive treatment corresponds with a new point of sight.

</P>
<P>

In bk. i. Origen sets out the final elements
of all religious philosophy, God, the world,
rational creatures. After dwelling on the
essential nature of God as incorporeal, invisible, incomprehensible, and on the characteristic relations of the Persons of the Holy
Trinity to man, as the authors of being, and
reason, and holiness, he gives a summary view
of the end of human life, Tor the elements of a
problem cannot be really understood until we
have comprehended its scope. The endof life,
then, according to Origen, is the progressive
assimilation of man to God by the voluntary
appropriation of His gifts. Gentile philosophers had proposed to themselves the idea
of assimilation to God, but Origen adds the
means. By the unceasing action of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit towards us, renewed at
each successive stage of our advance, we shall
be able, he says, with difficulty perchance, at
some future time, to look on the holy and
blessed life; and when once we have been
enabled to reach that, after many struggles,
we ought so to continue in it that no weariness
may take hold on us. Each fresh enjoyment
of that bliss ought to deepen our =for
it; while we are ever receiving, with more
ardent love and larger grasp, the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit (i. 3, 8).

</P>
<P>

But it will be said that this condition of progress, effort, assimilation, involves the possibility of declension, indolence, the obliteration
of the divine image. If man can go forward
he can go backward. Origen accepts the
consequence, and finds in it an explanation
of the actual state of men and angels. The
present position of each rational being corresponds, in his judgment, with the use he has
made of the revelations and gifts of God. No beings 
were created immutable. Some by diligent obedience have been raised to the 
loftiest places in the celestial hierarchy; others by perverse self-will and 
rebellion have sunk to the condition of demons. Others occupy an intermediate 
place, and are capable of being raised again to their first state, and so 
upward, if they avail themselves of the helps provided by the love of God. "Of 
these," he adds, "I think, as far as I can form an opinion, that this order of 
the human race was formed, which in the future age, or in the ages which 
succeed, when there shall be a new heaven and a new earth, shall be restored to 
that unity which the Lord promises in His intercessory prayer. . . . Meanwhile, 
both in the ages which are seen and temporal, and in those which are not seen 
and eternal, all rational beings who have fallen are dealt with according to the 
order, the character, the measure of their deserts. Some in the first, others in 
the second, some, again, even in the last times, through greater and heavier 
sufferings, borne through many ages, reformed by sharper discipline, and 
restored . . . stage by stage . . . reach that which is invisible and eternal . 
. ." Only one kind of change is impossible. There is no such transmigration of 
souls as Plato pictured, after the fashion of the Hindoos, in the legend of Er 
the Armenian. No rational being can sink into the nature of a brute (i. 8, 4; 
cf. <I>c. Cels.</I> iv. 83).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p7.1>The progress of this discussion is interrupted by one 
singular episode characteristic of the time. How, Origen asks, are we to regard 
the heavenly bodies--the sun and moon and stars? Are they the temporary abodes 
of souls which shall hereafter be released from them? Are they finally to be 
brought into the great unity, when "God shall be all in all"? The questions, he 
admits, are bold; but he answers both in the affirmative, on what he held to be 
the authority of Scripture (i. 7; cf. <I>c. Cels.</I> v. 10 f.).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p7.2>In bk. ii. Origen pursues, at greater length, his view of 
the visible world, as a place of discipline and preparation. He follows out as a 
movement what he had before regarded as a condition. The endless variety in the 
situations of men, the inequality of their material and moral circumstances, 
their critical spiritual differences, all tend to shew, he argues, that the 
position of each has been determined in accordance with previous conduct. God, 
in His ineffable wisdom, has united all together with absolute justice, so that 
all these creatures most diverse in themselves, combine to work out His purpose, 
while "their very variety tends to the one end of perfection." All things were 
made for the sake of man and rational beings. Through man, therefore this world, 
as God's work, becomes complete and perfect (cf. <I>c. Cels.</I> iv. 99). The 
individual is never isolated, though never irresponsible. At every moment he is 
acting and acted upon adding something to the sum of the moral forces of the 
world, furnishing that out of which God is fulfilling His purpose. The 
difficulties of life, as Origen regards the given scope for heroic effort and 
loving service. The fruits of a moral victory become more permanent as they are 
gained through harder toil. Obstacles and hindrances are incentives to exertion. 
Man's body is not a "prison," in the sense of a place of punishment only: it is 
a beneficent provision for discipline, furnishing such salutary restraints as 
are best fitted to further moral growth.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p7.3>This view of the dependence of the present on the past--to 
use the forms of human speech--seemed to Origen to remove a difficulty which 
weighed heavily upon thoughtful men then as now. Very many said then that the 
sufferings and disparities of life, the contrasts of law and gospel, point to 
the action of rival spiritual powers, or to a Creator limited by something 
external to Himself (ii. 9, 5). Not so, was Origen's reply; they simply reveal 
that what we see is a fragment of a vast system in which we can only trace 
tendencies, consequences, signs, and rest upon the historic fact of the 
Incarnation. In this respect he ventured to regard the entire range of being as 
"one thought" answering to the absolutely perfect will of God, while "we that 
are but parts can see but part, now this, now that." This seems to be the true 
meaning of his famous assertion, that the power of God in creation was finite 
and not infinite. It would, that is, be inconsistent with our ideas of perfect 
order, and therefore with our idea of the Divine Being, that the sum of first 
existences should not form one whole. "God made all things in number and 
measure." The omnipotence of God is defined (as we are forced to conceive) by 
the absolute perfections of His nature. "He cannot deny Himself" (ii. 9, 1, iv. 
35). It may be objected that our difficulties do not lie only in our present 
circumstances; the issues of the present, so far as we can see them, bring 
difficulties no less overwhelming; even if we allow this world to be a fit place 
of discipline for fallen beings capable of recovery, it is only too evident that 
the discipline does not always work amendment. Origen admits the fact, and draws 
the conclusion that other systems of penal purification and moral advance 
follow. World grows out of world, so to speak, till the consummation is reached. 
The nature, position, or constitution of the worlds to come he does not attempt 
to define. It is enough to believe that, from first to last, the will of Him Who 
is most righteous and most loving is fulfilled; and that each loftier region 
gamed is the entrance to some still more glorious abode above, so that all being 
becomes, as it were, in the highest sense a journey of the saints from mansion 
to mansion up to the very throne of God. To make this view clear Origen follows 
out, in imagination, the normal course of the progressive training, purifying, 
and illumination of men in the future. He pictures them passing from sphere to 
sphere, and resting in each so as to receive such revelations of the providence 
of God as they can grasp; lower phenomena are successively explained to them, 
and higher phenomena are indicated. As they look backward old mysteries are 
illuminated; as they look forward unimagined mysteries stir their souls with 
divine desire. Everywhere their Lord is with them, and they advance from 
strength to strength through the perpetual supply of spiritual food. This food, 
he says, is the contemplation and understanding <PB id=Page_781 thmlized="Y"

and as suits a nature which is made and created. And this measure--this due 
harmony and proportion between aim and power--it is right that every one should 
regard even now, who is beginning to see God, that is, to understand Him in 
purity of heart (ii. 11, 6 f.). But Origen goes on to shew that Scripture 
concentrates our attention upon the next scene, summed up in the words, 
resurrection, judgment, retribution. Nowhere is he more studiously anxious to 
keep to the teaching of the Word than in dealing with these cardinal ideas. For 
him the resurrection is not the reproduction of any particular organism, but the 
preservation of complete identity of person, an identity maintained under new 
conditions, which he presents under the apostolic figure of the growth of the 
plant from the seed: the seed is committed to the earth, perishes, and yet the 
vital power it contains gathers a new frame answering to its proper nature. 
Judgment is no limited and local act, but the unimpeded execution of the 
absolute divine law by which the man is made to feel what he is and what he has 
become and to bear the inexorable consequences of the revelation. Punishment is 
no vengeance, but the just severity of a righteous King, by which the soul is 
placed at least on the way to purification. Blessedness is no sensuous joy or 
indolent repose, but the opening vision of the divine glory, the growing insight 
into the mysteries of the fulfilment of the divine counsels.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p7.4>In bk. iii. Origen discusses the moral basis of his system. 
This lies in the recognition of free will as the inalienable endowment of 
rational beings. But this free will does not carry with it the power of 
independent action, but only the power of receiving the help which is extended 
to each according to his capacity and needs and therefore justly implying 
responsibility for the consequences of action. Such free will offers a 
sufficient explanation, in Origen's judgment, for what we see and gives a stable 
foundation for what we hope. It places sin definitely within the man himself, 
not without him. It preserves the possibility of restoration, while it enforces 
the penalty of failure. "'God said,' so he writes, 'let us make man in our image 
after our likeness.' Then the sacred writer adds, 'and God made man: in the 
image of God made He him.' This therefore that he says, 'in the image of God 
made He him,' while he is silent as to the likeness, has no other meaning than 
this, that man received the dignity of the image at his first creation: while 
the perfection of the likeness is kept in the consummation (of all things); that 
is, that he should himself gain it by the efforts of his own endeavour, since 
the possibility of perfection had been given him at the first . . ." (iii. 6, 
1). Such a doctrine, he shews, gives a deep solemnity to the moral conflicts of 
life. We cannot, even to the last, plead that we are the victims of 
circumstances or of evil spirits. The decision in each case rests with 
ourselves, yet so that all we have and are truly is the gift of God. Each soul 
obtains from the object of its love the power to fulfil His will. "It draws and 
takes to itself," he says in another place, "the Word of God in proportion to 
its capacity and faith. And when souls have drawn to themselves the Word of God, 
and have let Him penetrate their senses and their understandings, and have 
perceived the sweetness of His fragrance . . . filled with vigour and 
cheerfulness they speed after him" (<I>in Cant.</I> i.). Such a doctrine, so far 
from tending to Pelagianism, is the very refutation of it. It lays down that the 
essence of freedom is absolute self-surrender; that the power of right action is 
nothing but the power of God. Every act of man is the act of a free being, but 
not an exercise of freedom; if done without dependence upon God, it is done in 
despite of freedom, responsibly indeed, but under adverse constraint. The 
decision from moment to moment rests with us, but not the end. That is 
determined from the first, though the conduct of creatures can delay, through 
untold ages, the consummation of all things. The gift of being, once given, 
abides for ever. The rational creature is capable of change, of better and 
worse, but it can never cease to be. What mysteries lie behind; what is the 
nature of the spiritual body in which we shall be clothed; whether all that is 
finite shall be gathered up in some unspeakable way into the absolute,--that 
Origen holds is beyond our minds to conceive.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p7.5>Bk. iv. deals with the dogmatic basis of Origen's system. 
For this to follow the moral basis is unusual and yet intelligible. It moves 
from the universal to the special; from the most abstract to the most concrete; 
from the heights of speculation to the rule of authority. "In investigating such 
great subjects as these," Origen writes, "we are not content with common ideas 
and the clear evidence of what we see, but we take testimonies to prove what we 
state, even those which are drawn from the Scriptures which we believe to be 
divine" (iv. 1). Therefore, in conclusion, he examines with a reverence, 
insight, humility, and grandeur of feeling never surpassed, the questions of the 
inspiration and interpretation of the Bible. The intellectual value of the work 
may best be characterized by one fact. A single sentence from it was quoted by 
Butler as containing the germ of his <I>Analogy</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p7.6>Before he left Alexandria Origen wrote ten books of 
<I>Miscellanies</I> (<FONT face=symbol>StrwmateiV</FONT>: cf. Eus. <I>H.E.</I> 
vi. 18). In these he apparently discussed various topics in the light of ancient 
philosophy and Scripture (Hieron. <I>Ep. ad Magn.</I> lxx. 4). The three 
fragments which remain, in a Latin translation, give no sufficient idea of their 
contents. The first, from bk. vi., touches on the permissibility of deflection 
from literal truth, following out a remark of Plato (Hieron. <I>adv. Ruf.</I> i. 
§ 18: cf. <I>Hom.</I> xix. <I>in Jer.</I> § 7; <I>Hom. in Lev.</I> iii. § 4). 
The second, from bk. x., contains brief notes on the history of Susanna and Bel 
(Dan. xiii. xiv.) added by Jerome to his Comm. on Dan. The third, also from bk. 
x., gives an interpretation of Gal. v. 13, which is referred to the spiritual 
understanding of the Scripture narratives (Hieron. <I>ad loc.</I>; Cf. <I>in

crucial and startling proof of Origen's deficiency in historical criticism. 
Africanus pointed out, from its plays upon words among other things, that the 
writing must have been Greek originally, and that it was not contained in the 
"Hebrew" Daniel. To these arguments Origen answers that he had indeed been 
unable (<FONT face=symbol>filh gar h alhqeia</FONT>) to find Hebrew equivalents 
to the paronomasias quoted, but that they may exist; and that the Jews had 
probably omitted the history to save the honour of their elders. It must be 
allowed that right lies with the aged Africanus, who could address Origen as "a 
son," and whose judgment was in the spirit of his own noble saying: "May such a 
principle never prevail in the church of Christ that falsehood is framed for His 
praise and glory" (<I>Fragm. ap.</I> Routh, <I>R. S.</I> ii. 230).</P>

earlier apologists had been called upon to defend Christianity against the 
outbursts of popular prejudice, as a system compatible with civil and social 
order. Origen, in this work, entered a far wider field. It was his object to 
defend the faith against a comprehensive attack, conducted by critical, 
historical, and philosophical, as well as by political, arguments. He undertook 
the work very unwillingly, at the urgent request of Ambrose, but, once 
undertaken, he threw into it the whole energy of his genius. C<SMALL 
id=iii.xv.iv.p7.15>ELSUS</SMALL> was a worthy opponent, and Origen allows 
him to state his case in his own words, and follows him step by step in the 
great controversy. At first Origen proposed to deal with the attack of Celsus in 
a general form; but after i. 27 he quotes the objections of Celsus, in the order 
of their occurrence, and deals with them one by one, so that it is possible to 
reconstruct the work of Celsus, in great part, from Origen's quotations. It 
would be difficult to overrate the importance both of attack and defence in the 
history of religious opinion in the 2nd and 3rd cents. The form of objections 
changes; but every essential type of objection to Christianity finds its 
representative in Celsus's statements, and Origen suggests in reply thoughts, 
often disguised in strange dresses, which may yet be fruitful. No outline can 
convey a true idea of the fullness and variety of the contents of the treatise. 
Speaking broadly, the work falls into three parts--the controversy on the 
history of Christianity (bks. i. ii.), the controversy on the general character 
and idea of Christianity (bks. iii.-v.), the controversy on the relations of 
Christianity to philosophy, popular religion, and national life (bks. 
vi.-viii.). There are necessarily many repetitions, but in the main this appears 
to represent the course of the argument. The lines were laid down by Celsus: 
Origen simply followed him.</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p8>After some introductory chapters (i. 1-27), dealing with a 
large number of miscellaneous objections to Christianity as illegal, secret, of 
barbarous origin, inspired by a demoniac power, an offshoot of Judaism, Origen 
meets Celsus's first serious attack, directed against the Christian 
interpretation of the gospel history. In this case Celsus places his arguments 
in the mouth of a Jew. The character, as Origen points out, is not consistently 
maintained, but the original conception is ingenious. A Jew might reasonably be 
supposed to be the best critic of a system which sprang from his own people. The 
chief aim of the objector is to shew that the miraculous narratives of the 
Gospels are untrustworthy, inconclusive in themselves, and that the details of 
the Lord's life, so far as they can be ascertained, furnish no adequate support 
to the Christian theory of His person. The criticism is wholly external and 
unsympathetic. Can we suppose, Celsus asks, that He Who was God would be afraid 
and flee to Egypt (i., 66) ? could have had a body like other men (i. 69, ii. 
36)? would have lived a sordid, wandering life, with a few mean followers (i. 
62)? have borne insults without exacting vengeance (ii. 35)? have been met with 
incredulity (ii. 75)? have died upon the cross (ii. 68)? have shewn Himself only 
to friends if He rose again (ii. 63)? He repeats the Jewish story of the 
shameful birth of Christ, and of His education in Egypt, where Celsus supposes 
that He learned magical arts by which He imposed upon His countrymen. These 
illustrations sufficiently shew the fatal weakness of Celsus's position. He has 
no eye for the facts of the inner life. He makes no effort to apprehend the 
gospel offered in what Christ did and was, as a revelation of spiritual power; 
and Origen rises immeasurably superior to him in his vindication of the majesty 
of Christ's humiliation and sufferings (i. 29 ff.). He shews that Christ did 
"dawn as a sun" upon the world (ii. 30), when judged by a moral and not by an 
external standard (ii. 40); that He left His disciples the abiding power of 
doing "greater works" than He Himself did in His earthly life (ii. 48); that the 
actual energy of Christianity in regenerating men, <A class=Note 
href="http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.xv.iv.htm#_fnf1" 
name=_fnb1><SUP class=Note>1</SUP></A> was a proof that He Who was its spring 
was more than man (ii. 79). In bk. iii. and following books Celsus appears in 
his own person. He first attacks Christianity as being, like Judaism, originally 
a revolutionary system, based upon an idle faith in legends no more credible 
than those of Greece (iii, 1-43); then he paints it in detail as a religion of 
threats and promises, appealing only to the ignorant and sinful, unworthy of 
wise men, and, in fact, not addressed to them, even excluding them (iii. 44-81). 
Here again Origen has an easy victory. He has no difficulty in shewing that no 
real parallel can be established between the Greek heroes (iii. 22), or, as 
Celsus suggested, Antinous (iii. 36 ff.) and Christ. On the other side he can 
reply with the power of a life-long experience, that while the message of the 
gospel is universal and divine in its universality, "education is a way to 
virtue," a help towards the knowledge of God (iii. 45, 49, 58, 74) contributory, 
but not essentially supreme. But be rightly insists on placing the issue as to 
its claims in the moral and not in the intellectual realm. Christians are the 
proof of their creed. They are visibly transformed in character: the ignorant 
are proved wise, sinners are made holy (iii. 51, 64, 78 ff.).</P>

Christianity, and indeed of Biblical revelation, the Coming of God. This 
necessarily includes the discussion of the Biblical view of man's relation to 
God and nature. The contentions of Celsus are that there can be no sufficient 
cause and no adequate end for "a coming of God" (iv. 1-28); that the account of 
God's dealings with men in the O.T. is obviously incredible (iv. 29-50); that 
nature is fixed, even as to the amount of evil (iv. 62); and that man is 
presumptuous in claiming a superiority over what he calls irrational animals 
(iv. 54-99). In especial he dwells on the irrationality of the belief of a 
coming of God to judgment (v. 1-24); and maintains that there is a divine order 
in the distribution of the world among different nations, in which the Jews have 
no prerogative (v. 25-50). On all grounds therefore, he concludes, the claims of 
Christianity to be a universal religion, based on the coming of God to earth, 
are absurd. In treating these arguments Origen had a more arduous work than 
hitherto. The time had not then come--probably it has not come yet--when such 
far-reaching objections could be completely met; and Origen was greatly 
embarrassed by his want of that historic sense which is essential to the 
apprehension of the order of the divine revelations. His treatment of the O.T. 
narratives is unsatisfactory; and it is remarkable that he does not apply his 
own views on the unity of the whole plan of being, as grasped by man, in partial 
explanation at least of the present mysteries of life. They underlie indeed all 
he says; and much that he urges in detail is of great weight, as his remarks 
upon the conception of a divine coming (iv. 5 ff., 13 f.), the rational dignity 
of man (iv. 13, 23 ff., 30), the anthropopathic language of Scripture (iv. 71 
ff.), and on the resurrection (v. 16 ff.).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p8.2>In the last three books Origen enters again upon surer 
ground. He examines Celsus's parallels to the teaching of Scripture on the 
knowledge of God and the kingdom of heaven, drawn from Gentile sources (vi. 
1-23); and after a digression on a mystical diagnosis of some heretical sect, 
which Celsus had brought forward as a specimen of Christian teaching (vi. 
24-40), he passes to the true teaching on Satan and the Son of God and creation 
(vi. 41-65), and unfolds more in detail the doctrine of a spiritual revelation 
through Christ (vi. 66-81). This leads to a vindication of the O.T. prophecies 
of Christ (vii. 1-17), the compatibility of the two dispensations (vii. 18-26), 
and the Christian idea of the future life (vii. 27-40). Celsus proposed to point 
Christians to some better way, but Origen shews that he has failed: the purity 
of Christians puts to shame the lives of other men (vii. 41-61).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p8.3>The remainder of the treatise is occupied with arguments as 
to the relations of Christianity to popular worship and civil duties. Celsus 
urged that the "demons," the gods of polytheism, might justly claim some 
worship, as having been entrusted with certain offices in the world (vii. 
62-viii. 32); that the circumstances of life demand reasonable conformity to the 
established worship, which includes what is true in the Christian faith (viii. 
33-68); that civil obedience is paramount (viii. 69-75). Origen replies in 
detail; and specially he shews that the worship of one God is the essence of 
true worship (viii. 12 f.); that Christianity has a consistent certainty of 
belief, with which no strange opinions can be put into comparison (viii. 53 
ff.); that Christians do, in the noblest sense, support the civil powers by 
their lives, by their prayers, by their organization (viii. 75).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p8.4>The spirit of the arguments on both sides is essentially 
modern; in the mode of treatment much is characteristic of the age in which the 
writers lived. Two points of very different nature will especially strike the 
student. First, the peculiar stress which Origen, in common with other early 
writers, lays upon isolated passages of the prophets and the O.T. generally; 
secondly, the unquestioning belief which he, in common with Celsus, accords to 
the claims of magic and augury (i. 6, 67, iv. 92 f., vii. 67, viii. 58). But 
when every deduction has been made, it would not be easy to point to a 
discussion of the claims of Christianity more comprehensive or more rich in 
pregnant thought. Among early apologies it has no rival. The constant presence 
of a real antagonist gives unflagging vigour to the debate; and the conscious 
power of Origen lies in the appeal which he could make to the Christian life as 
the one unanswerable proof of the Christian faith (cf. <I>Praef.</I> 2; i. 27, 
67).</P>
<P id=iii.xv.iv.p8.5>There are many other passages of great interest and worthy 
of study apart from the context. Such are Origen's remarks on the spirit of 
controversy (vii. 46); the moral power of Christianity, its universality, and 
its fitness for man (ii. 64, iii. 28, 40, 54, 62, iv. 26, vii. 17, 35, 42, 59); 
foreknowledge (ii. 19 ff.); the anthropomorphism of Scripture (vi. 60 ff.); the 
beauty of the ideal hope of the Christian (iii. 81); the ideal of worship (viii. 
17 f., vii. 44); the divisions of Christians (iii. 12 f., v. 61); spiritual 
fellowship (viii. 64); and future unity (viii. 72).</P>

to Ambrose and Tatiana (<FONT face=symbol>filomaqestata kai gnhsiwtatio en 
qeosebeia adelfoi</FONT>, c. 33), in answer to their inquiries as to the 
efficacy, manner, subject, and circumstances of prayer. No writing of Origen is 
more free from his characteristic faults or more full of beautiful thoughts. He 
examines first the meaning and use of <FONT face=symbol>euch</FONT> (§ 3), and 
the objections urged against the efficacy of prayer, that God foreknows the 
future, and that all things take place according to His will (§ 5). Divine 
foreknowledge does not, he points out, take away man's responsibility: the moral 
attitude of prayer is in itself a sufficient blessing upon it (§§ 6 ff.). Prayer 
establishes an active communion between Christ and the angels in heaven (§§ 10 
f.) ; and the duty of prayer is enforced by the example of Christ and the saints 
(§§ 13 f.). Prayer must be addressed to God only, "our Father in heaven," and 
not to Christ the Son as apart from the Father, but to the Father through Him (§

old man he looked face to face on martyrdom. Their sufferings, he tells them, 
are a proof of their maturity (c. 1), and in some sense the price of future 
blessedness (2), for which man's earthly frame is unfitted (3 ff.). The denial 
of Christ, on the other hand, is the most grievous wrong to God (6 ff.). 
Believers are indeed pledged to endurance, which will be repaid with unspeakable 
joys (12 ff.). Moreover, they are encouraged in their trials by the thought of 
the unseen spiritual witnesses by whom they are surrounded in the season of 
their outward sufferings (18 ff.), and by the examples of those who have already 
triumphed (22 ff.). By martyrdom man can shew his gratitude to God (28 f.), and 
at the same time receive afresh the forgiveness of baptism, offering, as a true 
priest, the sacrifice of himself (30; cf. <I>Hom.</I> vii. <I>in Jud.</I> 2). So 
he conquers demons (32). The predictions of the Lord shew that he is not 
forgotten (34 ff.), but rather that through affliction is fulfilled for him some 
counsel of love (39 ff.), such as the union of the soul with God when freed from 
the distractions of life (47 ff.). Perhaps, too, the blood of martyrs may have 
gained others for the truth (50, <FONT face=symbol>taca t timiw aimata tvn

fragments and notices are most meagre. In one fragment (Delarue, i. p. 3, from

zeal of Ambrose imposed upon him. Another fragment of great interest, preserved 
by Eusebius, contains a defence of his study of heathen philosophy (<I>H. E.</I>

literature and the fruits of wide discipline to Christianity (c. 1). He 
illustrates this use of secular learning by the "spoiling of the Egyptians" (c.

and Basil. The former sent it to Theodosius, bp. of Tyana, <I>c.</I> 382, with a 
letter (Greg. Naz. <I>Ep.</I> cxv.) in which he says: "That you may have some

inspired Scripture is one Book. (6) That divine Scripture is one instrument of 
God, perfect and fitted (for its work). (7) The special character (<FONT

duty of not endeavouring to correct the inaccurate (<FONT

propriety of thought for those who can understand. (9) What is the reason that

(that) in the same place. (10) Passages in divine Scripture which seem to 
involve difficulties. (11) That we must seek the nourishment supplied by all 
inspired Scripture, and not turn from, the passages (<FONT

nothing in common with the irrational, superstitious faith of the Gentiles. . . 
. And in reply to those who say, How do we think that Jesus is God when He had a 
mortal body? (20) A reply to those who say that the whole world

deny it. (22) What is the dispersion of the
rational or human souls indicated under a
veil in the building of the Tower, and the confusion of tongues. (23) On Fate, and the reconciliation of divine foreknowledge with
human freedom; and how the stars do not
determine the affairs of men, but only indicate
them. (24) Of matter, that it is not uncreated

VIEW OF 


CHRISTIAN 


LIFE.-The picture of
Christian life in Origen&#39;s writings is less complete and vivid than we might expect. It
represents a society already sufficiently large,
powerful, and wealthy to offer examples of
popular vices. Origen contrasts the Christians of his own with those of an earlier time,
and pronounces them unworthy to bear the
name of " faithful " (Hom<I>. in Jer. iv. </I>3; cf.
<I>in Matt. xvii- </I>24). Some Christians by birth
were unduly proud of their descent <I>(in Matt.
</I>xv. &sect; 26). Others retained their devotion to
pagan superstitions-astrology, auguries, necromancy <I>(in josh. v. </I>6, vii. 4 ; cf. 


in. 


<I>Matt.
</I>xiii. &sect; 6) and secular amusements <I>(Hom. </I>


in.


<I>Lev. ix. 9, xi. </I>


I). 


There were many spiritual
" Gibeonites," men who gave liberal offerings
to the churches but not their lives <I>(in josh. x.
</I>


1, 


3). The attendance at church services was
infrequent <I>(in Josh. i. </I>7 <I>; Hom. in Gen. x. </I>


1, 


3).
The worshippers were inattentive <I>(Hom. in Ex.
</I>xiii. z) and impatient <I>(Hom. in Jud. vi. </I>


I).


Commercial dishonesty <I>(in Matt. xv. </I>I3) and
hardness <I>(Sel. in Job. p. </I>341 


L) 


had to be reproved. Such faults call out the preacher&#39;s
denunciations in all ages. An evil more
characteristic of his age is the growing ambition of the clergy. High places in the
hierarchy were sought by favour and by gifts
<I>(Hom. in Num. xxii. </I>4 ; cf. <I>in Matt. xvl. </I>22 ;
<I>Comm. Sey. &sect;&sect; 9, </I>


1o, 


12). Prelates endeavoured to nominate their kinsmen as their
successors <I>(ib. xxii. </I>4) ; and shrank from
boldly rebuking vice lest they should lose the
favour of the people <I>(in josh. vii. </I>6), using the
powers of discipline from passion rather than
with judgment <I>(in Matt. Comm. Ser. </I>


&sect; 14


), so
that their conduct already caused open scandal
<I>(Hom. in Num. ii. </I>17). They too often forgot
humility at their ordination <I>(Hom. in Exech.
</I>ix. 2). They despised the counsel of men of
lower rank, " not to speak of that of a layman
or a Gentile " (Hom<I>. an Ex. xi. </I>6). Origen in
particular denounces the pride of the leading
men in the Christian society, which already
exceeded that of Gentile tyrants, especially
in the more important cities <I>(in Matt. xvi. </I>8).

</P>
<P>

Traces still remained in his time of the
miraculous endowments of the apostolic
church, which he had himself seen (c. <I>Cels.
</I>ii. 8, iii. 24 ; in )Oh- t. 


xx. 


28, YXY11 Kai
Xeipwara ; cf. c. <I>Cels. i. </I>2). Exorcism was
habitually practised <I>(Hom. in Jos. xxiv. </I>


I).

future events foreseen by Christians through
the help of the Spirit (c. <I>Cels. i. </I>46 ; cf. 


i. 25,


iii. 36, viii. 58) ; and he says that the " name
of Jesus" was sometimes powerful against
demons, even when named by bad men (c. <I>Cell.
</I>i. 6 ; cf- v. 45). But this testimony must
be taken in conjunction with the belief in
magic which he shared with his contemporaries. He appeals unhesitatingly to the
efficacy of incantations with the use of sacred
names (c. <I>Cels. i. </I>22, iv. 33 ff.; cf. <I>in Matt.
Comet. Sey. </I>


&sect; IIO), 


and otherwise according
to secret rules (c. <I>Cels. i. </I>24; <I>Hom. in Num.
</I>xiii. 4 ; in <I>Jos. xx. fragm. </I>ap. <I>Philoc. c. xii.).</I>

</P>
<P>

Origen says little of the relations of Christians to other bodies in the state. The interpenetration of common life by paganism
necessarily excluded believers from most
public ceremonies and from much social intercourse. It also made them ill-disposed towards art, which was devoted to the old
religion (c. <I>Cels. iii. </I>56 ; de <I>Orat. </I>I7), and had
not yet found any place in connexion with
Christian worship (c. <I>Cels. vii. </I>63 ff-) . It is
remarkable that while Origen was pre-eminently distinguished for his vindication of the
claims of reason <I>(ib. i. </I>13) and of Gentile philosophy, as being the ripest fruit of man&#39;s
natural powers (cf. <I>Hom. in Gen. xiv. </I>3 ; in
<I>Ex. xi. </I>6) and not their corruption (Tertullian),
he still very rarely refers to the literature of
secular wisdom in his general writings as
ancillary to revelation. He even in some
cases refers its origin to " the princes of this
world " (de <I>Princ. iii. 3, z) ; and, </I>in an interesting outline of the course of Gentile education, remarks that it may only accumulate
a wealth of sins <I>(Hom. iii. in Ps. xxxvi. 6).
</I>But his directions for dealing with unbelievers
are marked by the truest courtesy <I>(Hom. in
Ex. iv. 9). </I>In spite of his own courageous
enthusiasm, he counselled prudence in times
of persecution <I>(in Matt. x. z3). </I>Occasions
for such self-restraint arose continually. For
Origen notices the popular judgment, active
from the time of Tertullian to that of Augustine, which referred " wars, famines, and
pestilences " to the spread of the faith (in
<I>Matt. Comet. Sey. &sect; 39) ; especially </I>he dwells
upon the animosity of the Jews, who " would
rather see a criminal acquitted than convicted
by the evidence of a Christian" <I>(ib. </I>


&sect; 16


<I>).
</I>Of the extension of Christianity he speaks in
general terms, rhetorically rather than exactly.
It was not preached among all the Ethiopians,
especially" those beyond the river," or among
the Chinese. " What," he continues, " shall
we say of the Britons or Germans by the
Ocean, Dacians, Sarmatians, Scythians, very
many of whom have not yet heard the word ? "
<I>(ib. &sect; 3g). </I>But some inhabitants of Britain
and Mauritania held the faith <I>(Hom. in Luc.
</I>vi.). Christians generally declined public
offices, not from lack of loyalty, but feeling
that they could serve their country better
through their own society (c. <I>Cels. viii. 73, 75).</I>

</P>
<P>

The church, according to Origen, is the
whole body of believers animated by Christ,
Who, as the Divine Logos, stirs each member,
so that without Him it does nothing (ib. vi. 48).
In the widest sense it has existed even from
the Creation <I>(in Cant. ii. p. </I>418 L.). Such a
view, which makes the church coextensive


with the existence of divine fellowship, carries
with it the corollary, that " without the church
there is no salvation " (Hom<I>. in Jos. iii. 6).
</I>Origen, as has been seen, shewed practically
his respect for the see of Rome, but he recognized no absolute supremacy in St. Peter <I>(in
Matt. xii. </I>


ii). 


He held indeed that he had
a certain pre-eminence <I>(in Joh. </I>t. xxxii. g)
and that the church was founded on him
<I>(Hom. in Ex. v. </I>4), but every disciple of
Christ, he affirms, holds in a true sense the
same position <I>(Comet. in Matt. </I>xii. ro).

</P>
<P>

Origen lays great stress upon the importance
of right belief <I>(in Matt. </I>t. <I>xii. 23; Comet.
Sey. in Matt. &sect; 33 ; de Orat. 29). As </I>a young
man he refused every concession to a misbeliever in the house of his benefactress (Eus.
<I>H. E. </I>vi. 2). In later years he laboured successfully to win back those who had fallen
into error. But his sense of the infinite greatness of the truth made him tolerant (c. <I>Cels.
v. 63). </I>Varieties of belief arose from the very
vastness of its object <I>(ib. iii. </I>12) ; and his
discussion of the question, Who is a heretic ?
is full of interest <I>(Fyagm. in Ep. ad Tit.).</I>

</P>
<P>

Casual notices in Origen&#39;s writings give a
fairly complete view of the current religious
observances. He speaks generally of stated
times of daily prayer, " not less than three "
<I>(de Orat. </I>r2), of the days they kept-" the
Lord&#39;s days (cf. <I>Hom. in Ex. vii. </I>g ; in <I>Num.
</I>xxiii. 4), Fridays, Easter, Pentecost " (c<I>. Cels.
</I>


Viii. 


22 ; cf. <I>Hom. in </I>IS. 


Vi. &sect; 2


)-and of the
Lenten, Wednesday, and Friday fasts <I>(Hom.
in Lev. </I>x. 2). Some still added Jewish rites
to the celebration of Easter <I>(Hom. in Jey. xii.
</I>13) and other traces remained of Judaizing&#39;
practices <I>(ib. </I>x. &sect; 2). Jewish converts, Origen
says without reserve, " have not left their

national law " (c. <I>Cels. ii. </I>r, cf- &sect; 3) ; thoughe lays down that Christ forbade His disciplesto be circumcised <I>(ib. i. </I>22 ; cf- v. 48). Christians, however, still abstained from " things
strangled " (ib<I>. viii. 3o) </I>and from meat
offered to idols <I>(ib. </I>24). Outward forms had
already made progress; and the religion of
some consisted in "bowing their head to
priests, and in bringing offerings to adorn the
altar of the church" <I>(Hom. in Jos. x. 3).</I>

</P>
<P>

Baptism was administered to infants, " in
accordance with apostolic tradition " (in <I>Rom.
v. &sect; 9, p. 397 </I>L. ; H<I>om. in Lev. viii. &sect; 3 ; in Luc.
</I>xiv.), in the name of the Holy Trinity <I>(in Rom.

the solemn renunciations " of the devil and of
his pomps, works, and pleasures " (Hom<I>. in
Num. xii. </I>4). The unction (confirmation) does
not appear to have been separated from it <I>(in
Rom. v. &sect; 8, </I>p. 38r : " omnes baptizati in
aquis istis visibilibus et in chrismate visibili").
The gift of the Holy Spirit comes only from
Christ, and Origen held that it was given
according to His righteous will: " Not all
who are bathed in water are forthwith bathed
in the Holy Spirit" <I>(Hom. in Nnm. iii. </I>r).

ii. in Ps. xxxvii. 6 ; Sel. in Ps. p. 365 </I>L. The
ruling thought of his interpretation is suggested by John vi. : " corpus Dei Verbi aut
sanguis quid aliud esse potest nisi verbum
quod nutrit et verbum quod laetificat ? " (in
<I>Matt. Comet. Sey. &sect; 85</I>) ; "bibere autem
dicimur sanguinem Christi non solum sacramentorum ritu sed et cum sermones ejus recipimus in quibus vita consistit, sicut et ipse
dicit, <I>Verba quae locutus sum spiritus et vita
est " (Hom. in Num. xvi. &sect; 9 ; cf</I>. xxiii. &sect; 6<I>).
</I>The passage which is often quoted to skew
" a presence of Christ in the sacrament <I>extra
usum," </I>indicates nothing more than the
reverence which naturally belongs to the consecrated elements (" consecratum munus,"
<I>Hom. in Ex. xiii. </I>3). The kiss of peace was
still given " at the time of the mysteries " (in
<I>Cant. i. p. 33 </I>1 L.) " after prayers" <I>(in Rom.
x. &sect; 33) ; and </I>the love-feast (&#39;Ayb&#39;") was sufficiently notorious for Celsus to attack it (c.
<I>Cels. i. </I>r) ; but the practice of " feet-washing,"
if it ever prevailed, was now obsolete <I>(in Joh.
xxxii. &sect; 7 ; Hom. in Is. vi. &sect; 3) </I>His use of
Jas. v. 14, in <I>Hom in I ev. ii. </I>4, does not give
any support, as has been affirmed, to the
practice of extreme unction.

</P>
<P>

The treatise <I>On Prayer </I>gives a vivid picture
of the mode and attitude of prayer. It was
usual to turn to the east <I>(de Orat. 31 ; Hom.

both recognized <I>(de Oyat. l.c. ; Hom. in Num.
</I>xi. &sect; g ; cf. <I>in Sam. Hom. </I>i. &sect; g). Forms of
prayer were used <I>(Hom. in Jer. </I>xiv. &sect; 14) and
prayers made in the vernacular language of
each country (c. Cels. viii. <I>3r).</I>

Origen frequently refers to confession as
made to men and not to God only <I>(Hom. in
Luc. xvii. ; de Orat. 28; Hom. ii, in Ps.
</I>axxvii. &sect; 6) ; and reckons penitence completed
by such confession to a " priest of the Lord "
as one of the modes for forgiveness of sins
<I>(Hom. ii. in Lev. &sect; 4</I>). He speaks of public
confession (1~ouoA6yno~tr) to God as efficacious
<I>(Hom. i. in Ps. xxxvi. &sect; 5</I>), a form of penitence
to be adopted after wise advice <I>(ib. xxxvii.
</I>&sect; 6) ; and he supposes that the efficacy of
" the power of the keys " depends upon the
character of those who exercise it <I>(in Matt.
</I>t. xii. &sect; r4). Discipline was enforced by exclusion from common prayer <I>(in Matt. Comet.
Ser. &sect; 89) ; and </I>for more serious offences
penitence was admitted once only <I>(Rom. in
Lev. xv. &sect; z)</I>. Cf. also what is said on " sin
unto death" <I>(ib. </I>

offended grievously after baptism were looked
upon as incapable of holding office (c. <I>Cels.

The threefold ministry is treated as universally recognized; and Origen speaks of
presbyters as priests, and deacons as Levites
<I>(Hom. in Jer. xii. </I>3). The people were to be
present at the ordination of priests (Hom. do
<I>Lev. vii. 3) </I>and he recognizes emphatically the
priesthood of all Christians who " have been
anointed with the sacred chrism " (ib<I>. ix. 9 ;
</I>cf. <I>Hom. </I>in <I>Num. v. 3 ; in </I>Jos. vii. z ; cf. <I>Exh.

</P>

having a definite place in the church organization <I>(Hom. in Is. vi. &sect; 3; Hom. in Luc. xvii.) ,
</I>yet not apparently combined in any order <I>(in
Rom. x. &sect;&sect; 17, 20).</I>

</P>
<P>

As yet no absolute rule existed as to the celibacy of the clergy. Origen himself was inclined to support it by his own judgment <I>(Hom.
in Lev. vi. &sect; 6). " No </I>bishop, however, or
presbyter or deacon or widow could marry a
second time" <I>(Hom. in Luc. xvii.) : such
</I>Origen held to be in a second class, not " of
the church without spot " (l.c. ; but cf. note
on I. Cor. vii. <I>8). </I>It was a sign of the difficulties of the time that some " rulers of the
church " allowed a woman to marry again
while her husband (presumably a Gentile who
had abandoned her) was still living <I>(in Matt.
</I>t. xiv. 


&sect; 23


<I>). </I>Origen&#39;s own example and
feeling were strongly in favour of a strict
and continent life (cf. c. <I>Cels. vii. 48 ; Hom.
in Gen. v. 4), </I>while he condemns false asceticism <I>(Zn Matt. Comm. Sey. </I>


&sect; Io). 


He
enforces the duty of systematic almsgiving
<I>(ib. &sect; 61) ; and </I>maintains that the law of
offering the firstfruits to God, that is to the
priests, is one of the Mosaic precepts which

ORIGEN AS CRITIC AND INTERPRETER.-
<P>


Origen regarded the Bible as the source and
rule of truth <I>(Hom. in Jey. i. &sect; 7). </I>Christ is
" the Truth," and they who are sure of this
seek spiritual knowledge from His very words
and teaching alone, given not only during His
earthly presence, but through Moses and the
prophets <I>(de Princ. </I>Praef. 


I). 


The necessary
points of doctrine were, Origen held, comprised
by the apostles in a simple creed handed down
by tradition <I>(ib. ii.), </I>but the fuller exhibition
of the mysteries of the gospel was to be sought
from the Scriptures. He made no sharp
division between O. and N. T. They must
be treated as one body, and we must be careful not to mar the unity of the spirit which
exists throughout <I>(in Joh. x. 13 ; cf</I>. <I>de Princ.
ii. 4). </I>The divinity of the O.T. is indeed first
seen through Christ <I>(de Pyinc. iv. </I>


1, 


<I>6).</I>

</P>
<P>

(I) 


<I>The Canon of </I>Scripture.-In fixing the
contents of the collection of sacred books
Origen shews some indecision. In regard to
O.T. he found a serious difference between
the Hebrew canon and the books commonly
found in the Alexandrine Greek Bible. In
his <I>Comm. on </I>Ps. i. he gives a list of the
canonical books 


(al iv&amp;dOriuoL ~LpXot) 


according to the tradition of the Hebrews, <I>22
</I>in number <I>(ap. Eus. H. E. </I>


Vi. 


<I>25). </I>In the
enumeration the <I>Book of the Twelve </I>(minor)
<I>Prophets is </I>omitted by the error of Eusebius
or of his transcriber, for it is necessary to make
up the number; and the " Letter " (Baruch
vi.) is added to J eremiah, because (apparently)
it occupied that position in Origen&#39;s copy of
the LXX., for there is no evidence that it was
ever included in the Hebrew Bible. The

</P>


787




<P>


<I>Books of the Maccabees, </I>which (I. Macc.) bore
a Hebrew title, were not included (9~m 


To4TWY


EQTL). 


But while Origen thus gives a primary
place to the books of the Hebrew Canon, he expressly defends, in his letter to Africanus, the
use of the additions found in the Alexandrine
LXX. (cf. p. <I>122). </I>He was unwilling to
sacrifice anything sanctioned by custom and
tending to edification. His own practice
reflects this double view. He never, so far as
we know, publicly expounded any apocryphal
books of O.T., while he habitually quotes them
as having authority, though he frequently
notes that their authority was challenged.
He quotes the <I>Book of Enoch (c. Cels. v. 55;
de Princ. iv. 35 ; Hom. in Num. xxviii. 2),
</I>the <I>Prayer of Joseph (in Joh. ii. 25, et </I>


T9s


apoolerat), 


the <I>Assumtption of Moses (Hom.
in Jos. ii. </I>


I), 


and the <I>Ascension of Isaiah (ib. ;
de Princ. iii. 2, </I>


1 


; cf. <I>in Matt. </I>t. x. <I>18) ; and
</I>it is probably to books of this class that his
interesting remarks on " apocryphal " books
in Pyol. <I>in Cant. p. 325 </I>L. refer.

</P>
<P>

How far Origen was from any clear view of
the history of O.T. may be inferred from the
importance he assigns to the tradition of
Ezra&#39;s restoration of their text from memory
after the Babylonian captivity <I>(Sel. in Jey.
xi. p. 5 </I>L. ; S<I>el. in Ps. id. p. 371).</I>

</P>
<P>

His testimony to the contents of N.T. is
more decided. He notices the books which
were generally acknowledged as possessing
unquestionable authority: the <I>Four Gospels
</I>[the <I>Acts *], I. Peter, I. John, thirteen Epistles
of St. Paul. To </I>these he adds the <I>Apocalypse,
</I>for he seems to have been unacquainted with
its absence from the Syrian Canon <I>(aP. </I>Eus.
<I>H. E. vi. </I>


25). 


In another passage, preserved
only in the Latin trans. of Rufinus <I>(Hom. in
Jey. vii. </I>


I), 


he enumerates all the books of the
received N.T., without addition or omission,
as the trumpets by which the walls of the
spiritual Jericho are to be overthrown <I>(the
Four Gospels, I. </I>and II. <I>Peter, James, Jude,
the Epistles </I>and <I>Apocalypse </I>


of 


<I>St. John, </I>the
Acts by St. Luke, <I>fourteen Epistles of St. Paul).
</I>This enumeration, though it cannot be
received without reserve, may represent his
popular teaching. In isolated notices he
speaks of the disputed books as received by
some but not by all <I>(Hebrews; ap. </I>Eus. H. <I>E.

(2) The Text.-Origen had very little of the
critical spirit, in the modern acceptation of the
phrase. This is especially seen in his treatment of Biblical texts. His importance for
textual criticism is that of a witness and not
of a judge. fie gives invaluable evidence as
to what he found, but his few endeavours to
determine what is right, in a conflict of
authorities, are for the most part unsuccessful
both in method and result. Generally, however, he makes no attempt to decide on the
one right reading. He would accept all the
conflicting readings as contributing to edification. Even&#39; his great labours on the Greek
translations of O.T. were not directed rigorously to the definite end of determining the
authentic text, but mainly to recording the
extent and character of the variations. He
then left his readers to use their own judgment.

</P>
<P>

This want of a definite critical aim is more
decisively shewn in his treatment of N.T.
Few variations are more remarkable than
those in Heb. ii. 9: XdptrL Beov" and Xwpts
Beov. Origen was acquainted with both, and
apparently wholly undesirous to choose between them ; both gave a good sense and that
was a sufficient reason for using both (in Joh.
t. i. 40 : erre U Xwpts Oeov" . . . efre XdpLrc . . .


<I>%b. </I>


xxviii. X4: the Latin of Comm. in Rom.
iii. &sect; 8, v. &sect; 7, sine Deo, is of no authority for
Origen&#39;s judgment).

</P>
<P>

His importance as a witness to the true
text of N.T. is, nevertheless, invaluable. Notwithstanding the late date and scantiness of
the MSS. in which his Greek writings have
been preserved, and the general untrustworthiness of the Latin translations in points
of textual detail, it would be possible to determine a pure text of a great part of N.T. from
his writings alone (cf. Griesbach, Symb


<I>. </I>


Crit.
t. ii.). In some respects his want of a critical

</P>


ORIGIENES
spirit makes his testimony of greater value
<P>



than if he had followed consistently an independent judgment. He reproduces the
characteristic readings which he found, and
thus his testimony is carried back to an
earlier date. At different times he used copies
exhibiting different complexions of text ; so
that his writings reflect the variations faithfully. But great care is required in using
the evidence which Origen&#39;s quotations
furnish. He frequently quotes from memory;
combines texts; and sometimes gives repeatedly a reading which he can hardly have
found in any MS. (e.g. I. John iii. 8, yey&amp;v71rac).
Illustrations of this perplexing laxity occur
in Hom. in Jer. i. rg (Matt. iii. r2, xiii. 39)

(3) Interpretation.-Origen has been spoken
of as the founder of a new form of literature
in Biblical interpretation, and justly; though
others, conspicuously Heracleon, preceded
him in expositions of Scripture more or less
continuous. Origen constantly refers to
previous interpretors, esp. to Heracleon.

</P>
<P>

Origen&#39;s method of interpreting Scripture
was a practical deduction from his view of the
inspiration of Scripture. This he developed
in the treatise On First Principles, bk. iv. He
regarded every " jot and tittle " as having
its proper work (Hom. in Jer. xxxix. fr. ep.
Philoc. c. x.). All is precious; not even the
least particle is void of force (in Matt. t.
xvi. r2). Cf. Efi. 


<I>ad Greg. &sect; 3 ; in Joh. </I>


t. i.
&sect; 4. Minute details of order and number veil
and yet suggest great thoughts 


<I>(e.g. Set. in
Pss. xi. 370, 377 </I>


L). 


It follows that in interpretation there is need of great exactness and
care 


<I>(in Gen. </I>


t. iii. p. 46 L. ; P


<I>hiloc. xiv.)
</I>


and scrupulous study of details 


<I>(in Joh. ax.
</I>


29). Origen illustrates his principles by countless subtle observations of great interest.
His skill in combining passages from different
parts of Scripture in illustration of some
particular phrase or detail is specially noticeable. Each term calls up far-reaching associations; and all Scripture is made to contribute
to the fullness of the thought to be expressed.

</P>
<P>

Though Origen&#39;s critical knowledge of Hebrew was slight, he evidently learnt much
from Hebrew interpreters and not unfrequently quotes Hebrew traditions and "Midrash."
He gives also an interpretation of " Corban "


<I>(in Matt. </I>


t. xi. 9) and of " Iscariot " (in 


<I>Matt.
Comm. Ser. 78) </I>


from Jewish sources.

</P>
<P>

To obviate the moral and historical difficulties of O.T. he systematized the theory of
a " spiritual sense," which was generally if
vaguely admitted by the church 


<I>(de Princ. r,
</I>


Praef. 


<I>8). </I>


There is, he taught, generally, 


a


threefold meaning in the text of the Bible,
literal (historical), moral, mystical, corresponding to the three elements in man&#39;s constitution, body, soul, and spirit (de 


<I>Princ. iv.
rr ; Hom. in Lev. v. &sect;&sect; r, 5). </I>


Thus Scripture
has a different force for different ages and
different readers, according to their circumstances and capacities 


<I>(in Rom. ii. </I>


&sect; 14, 


p.


<I>r5o </I>


L.). But all find in it what they need.

</P>

This threefold sense is to be sought both
<P>


in O. and N. T. The literal interpretation
brings out the simple precept or fact; the
moral meets the individual want of each


believer; the mystical illuminates features
in the whole work of Redemption 


<I>(Hom. in
</I>


Lev. i. &sect;&sect; 4 f., ii. &sect; 4 ; de 


<I>Princ. iv. </I>


12, 13, 22).


There is then manifold instruction for all believers in the precise statement, the definition
of practical duties, the revelation of the divine
plan, which the teacher must endeavour to
bring out in his examination of the text.
Origen steadily kept this object in view.

</P>
<P>

It is easy to point out serious errors in detail
in his interpretation of Scripture. On these
there is no need to dwell. His main defect
and the real source of his minor faults was his
lack of true historic feeling. For him prophecy ceased to have any vital connexion with
the trials and struggles of a people of God ;
and psalms 


<I>(e.g. Ps. 1.) </I>


were no longer the
voice of a believer&#39;s deepest personal experience. In this Origen presents, though in a
modified form, many of the characteristic
defects of Rabbinic interpretation. He may
have been directly influenced by the masters
of Jewish exegesis. Just as they claimed for
Abraham the complete fulfilment of the Law, ii,
and made the patriarchs perfect types of legal
righteousness, Origen refused to see in the
Pentateuch any signs of inferior religious
knowledge or attainment. He deemed the
patriarchs and prophets as wise by God&#39;s gifts
as the apostles 


<I>(an Joh. vi. 3) </I>


; and the deepest j
mysteries of Christian revelation could be
directly illustrated from their lives and words


<I>(ib. </I>


ii. 28), 


though sometimes he seems to feel
the difficulties of this position 


<I>(ib. </I>


xiii. 46 ;
cf- c. 


<I>Cels. </I>


vii. 4 ff.).

</P>
<P>

While this grave defect is distinctly acknowledged, it must be remembered that. Origen
had a special work to do, and did it. In his
time powerful schools of Christian speculation
disparaged the O.T. or rejected it. Christian
masters had not yet been able to vindicate
it from the Jews and for themselves. This
task Origen accomplished. From his day
the O.T. has been a part of our Christian
heritage, and he fixed rightly the general
spirit in which it is to be received. The O.T.,
he says, is always new to Christians who
understand and expound it spiritually and in
an evangelic sense, new not in time but in
interpretation 


<I>(Hom. </I>


in. 


<I>Num. </I>


ix. &sect; 4 ; cf.


<I>c. Cels. ii. </I>


4). If in pressing this he was led
to exaggeration, the error may be pardoned
in regard to the greatness of the service.

</P>
<P>

His method was fixed and consistent. He&#39;
systematized what was before tentative and
inconstant (cf. Redepenning, 


<I>de </I>


Princ. pp.
56 f.). He laid down, once for all, broad outlines of interpretation; and mystical meanings were not arbitrarily devised to meet
particular emergencies. The influence of his
views is a sufficient testimony to their power.
It is not too much to say that the medieval
interpretation of Scripture in the West was
inspired by Origen ; and through secondary
channels these medieval comments have
passed into our own literature.

</P>
<P>

He was indeed right in principle. " He
felt that there was something more than a
mere form in the Bible ; he felt that ` the
words of God&#39; must have an eternal significance, for all that comes into relation with
God is eternal; he felt that there is a true development and a real growth.in the elements of

</P>


ORIGENES  789

<P>


divine revelation, if not in divine communication, yet in human apprehension; he felt
the power and the glory of the spirit of Scripture bursting forth from every part." loo
labour was too great to bestow upon the text
in which priceless treasures were enshrined;
no hope too lofty for the interpreter to cherish.

</P>
<P>

ORIGEN AS A THEOLOGIAN.-Origen was
essentially the theologian of an age of transition. His writings present principles, ruling
ideas, tendencies, but are not fitted to supply
materials for a system of formulated dogmas,
after the type of later confessions. Every
endeavour to arrange his opinions according
to the schemes of the x6th cent. can only
issue in a misunderstanding of their general
scope and proportion. The whole structure
of his treatise 


<I>On </I>


First <I>Principles, e.g&#39;, </I>presents a connected view of his intellectual
apprehension of Christianity, widely different
from medieval and modern expositions of
the faith. Starting from a clear and deeply
interesting exposition of what were acknowledged to be the doctrines held generally by
the church, corresponding in the main with
the Apostles&#39; Creed 


<I>(de </I>


Ptinc. Praef.), Origen
endeavours to determine, by the help of
Scripture and reason, subjects yet unexplored.
But his inquiries and results cannot be judged
fairly when taken out of their connexion with
contemporary thought. The book contains
very little technical teaching. It is silent as
to the sacraments; it gives no theory of the
atonement, no discussion of justification;
yet deals with problems of thought and life
which lie behind these subjects.

</P>
<P>

Origen found himself face to face with
powerful schools which, within and without
the church, maintained antagonistic views on
man, the world, and God, in their extremest
forms. There was the false realism, which
found expression in Montanism ; the false
idealism, which spread widely in the many
forms of Gnosticism. Here the Creator was
degraded into a secondary place; there God
Himself was lost in His works. Some represented men as inherently good or bad from
their birth; others swept away moral distinctions of action. Origen sought to maintain two great truths : the unity of all creation,
as answering to the thought of a Creator
infinitely good and infinitely just; and the
power of moral determination in rational
beings. The treatment and apprehension of
these truths are modified by the actual fact of
sin. &#39;1 &#39;he power of moral determination has

<I>(x) Finite Beings, Creation, Man, Spisitsi-
<P>
</I>


Origen endeavours to pass from the outward
to the inward, from the temporal to the
eternal. He thinks that we shall best realize
the fact of creation, according to our present
powers, by supposing a vast succession of
orders, one springing out of another <I>(de Princ.
</I>ii. x, 3). The present order, which began
and will end in time, must be one only in the
succession of corresponding orders U b. iii. 5, 3).
" In the beginning," then, he writes, " when
God created what He was pleased to create,
that is rational natures, He had no other
cause of creation beside Himself, that is His
own goodness " (ib. ii. 9, 6 ; cf- iv. 35). This

creation answered to a definite thought, and
therefore, Origen argues, was definite itself.
God " could " not create or embrace in thought
that which has no limit (ib. ii. <I>fragm. Gr. 6;
ii. g, r ; iv. fragm. Gr. 4). </I>The rational creatures He made were all originally equal,
spiritual, free. But moral freedom, including
personal self-determination, led to difference.
Finite creatures, once made, either advanced,
through imitation of God, or fell away,
through neglect of Him (ib. ii. g, <I>6).</I>

</P>
<P>

Evil, it follows, is negative-the loss of good
which was attainable, the shadow which marks
the absence or rather the exclusion of light.
But as God made creatures for an end, so He
provided that they should, through whatever
discipline of sorrow, attain it. He made
matter also, which might serve as a fitting
expression for their character, and become,
in the most manifold form, a medium for their
training. So it was that, by various declensions, " spirit " (7rveu"ga) lost its proper
fire and was chilled into a " soul " (,pvxht), and
" souls" were embodied in our earthly
frames in this world of sense. Such an embodiment was a provision of divine wisdom
which enabled them, in accord with the
necessities of the fact, to move towards the j
accomplishment of their destiny (ib. i. 7, <I>4).</I>

</P>
<P>

Under this aspect man is a microcosm.
<I>(Hom. in Gen. i. r r ; in Lev. v. </I>2 : i<I>ntellige to et
alium mundum esse payvum et intya to esse
solem, esse lunam, etiam stellas.) </I>He stands in
the closest connexion with the seen and the
unseen ; and is himself the witness of the
correspondences which exist between visible
and invisible orders <I>(Hom. in Num. xi- </I>4, xvii.
&cent;, xxiv. r, 


x%Viii. 2 


<I>; Hom. i. in Ps. xxxvii. </I>r ;
<I>in Joh. </I>t. xix. g, xxiii. 4 <I>; de Princ. iv.
fragm. Gr. p. </I>r84 R.). He is made for the
spiritual and cannot find rest elsewhere.

</P>
<P>

As a necessary consequence of his deep view
of man&#39;s divine kinsmanship, Origen labours
to give distinctness to the unseen world. He
appears already to live and move in it. He
finds there the realities of which the phenomena
of earth are shadows (cf. <I>in Rom. x. &sect; 39).
</I>External objects, peoples, cities, are to him
veils and symbols of invisible things; and
not only is there the closest correspondence
between the constitution of different orders of
being, but also even now a continuation of
unobserved intercourse between them (cf. <I>de
Princ. ii. </I>g, 3). Angels (ib. i. 8, iii. 2, <I>passim)
</I>preside over the working of elemental forces,
over plants and beasts <I>(in Num. Hom. xiv. </I>2 ;
<I>in Jer. Hom. x. 6 ; c. Cels. viii. </I>3 <I>r ; de Princ. iii.
</I>3, 3), and it is suggested that nature is affected
by their moral condition <I>(in Ezech. Hom. iv. </I>2).
More particularly men were, in Origen&#39;s
opinion, committed to the care of spiritual
" rulers," and deeply influenced by changes in
their feeling and character <I>(in Joh. xiii. </I>&sect; 5 8 ;
<I>cf. de Princ. i. </I>8, x). Thus he recognized
guardian angels of cities, provinces and nations
<I>(Hom. in Luc. xii. ; de Princ. iii. </I>3, 2), a belief
which he supported habitually by the LXX
version of Deut. xxxii. 8 <I>(in Matt. </I>t. xi.

<I>in Esech. Hom. i. y ; in Jud. vi. 2 ; de Princ. iii.

assisted the devotions of the faithful <I>(de Orat.
</I>aagi. p. 283 L. <I>; Hom. in Luc. xxiii. ; c. Cels.
viii. 64). </I>But while Origen recognizes most
fully the reality and power of angelic ministra.
tion, he expressly condemns all angel-worship
<I>(c. Cels. v. 4, </I>rr).

</P>
<P>

On the other hand, there are spiritual hosts
of evil corresponding to the angelic forces and
in conflict with them <I>(in Matt. </I>t. xvii. 2 ;
<I>in Matt. Comet. Ser. &sect; roe </I>; H<I>om. %n Jos. xv.
</I>g) He even speaks of a Trinity of evil <I>(in
Matt. xi. &sect; 6, xii. &sect; 20</I>). An evil power strives
with the good for the sway of individuals <I>(in
Rom. i. &sect; r8</I>) ; thus all life is made a struggle
of unseen powers <I>(e.g. </I>notes on Ps. xxxvii. ;
<I>in Joh. xx. &sect;&sect; </I>29, <I>32 ; Hom xx. in Jos. Fragm.)</I>

</P>
<P>

One aspect of this belief had a constant and
powerful influence on daily life. Origen, like
most of his contemporaries, supposed that evil
spiritual beings were the objects of heathen
worship (c. <I>Cell. vii. g). </I>There was, for him,
a terrible reality in their agency. Within
certain limits they could work so as to bind
their servants to them.

</P>
<P>

Origen believed also that the dead, too, influenced the living. The actions of men on
earth last, in their effects, after the actors
have departed (in <I>Rom. ii. 4, p. </I>8o L.). Disembodied (or unembodied) souls are not idle
<I>(in Matt. xv. 3g). So </I>the " soul " of Christ
preached to " souls " (c. Cels. iii. 43) ; and the
saints sympathize with man still struggling on
earth with a sympathy larger than that of
those who are clogged by conditions of mortality (de Oyat. xi.; in Matt. t. xxvii. 30 ;
in Joh. t. xiii. gy ; iii. in Cant. y).

</P>
<P>

Without extenuating the effects of man&#39;s
sin, maintained a lofty view of the
nobility of his nature and destiny (c. Cels. iv.
zg, 30) ; held that the world had been made
by divine wisdom a fitting place for the purification of a being such as man (de Princ. ii. r,
r ; z, 


2 : 3, 


r ; c. Cels. vi. 44 ; cf. in <I>Rom. viii.
</I>ro, p. 


261) 


; and that everything has been so
ordered by Providence from the first as to
contribute to this end (de Princ. ii. r, 


2). 


Man
can, if he will, read the lesson of his life : he
has a spiritual faculty, by which he can form
conclusions on spiritual things, even as he is
made to form conclusions on impressions of
sense. The body, so to speak, reflects the
soul; the " outer man " expresses the " inner
man" (in Rom. ii. 13, p. 


142 


L.). There is
imposed upon us the duty of service (in Matt.
<I>Comet. </I>Sey. &sect; 66), and the offices are many
(in Joh. t. a. z3), room being made even for
the meanest <I>(Hom. </I>in <I>Num. xiv. </I>


2, 


p. 162 L.).

</P>
<P>

The visible creation thus bears, in all its
parts, the impress of a divine purpose; and
the Incarnation was the crowning of the creation, by which the purpose was made fully
known, and provision made for its accomplishment (de Princ. iii. g, 6).

</P>
<P>

(z) The <I>Incarnation. The </I>Person of Christ.
The Holy Trinity. The Work of Chy%st.-On
no subject is Origen more full or suggestive
(de Py%nc. 


i. 2 ; ii


. 6 ; iv. 3r). No one perhaps
has done so much to vindicate and harmonize
the fullest acknowledgment of the perfect
humanity of the Lord and of His perfect
divinity in one Person. His famous image of

the " glowing iron " (ib. ii. 6, 6) made an epoch
in Christology. Here and there his language
is liable to misconception, or even proved
erroneous by later investigations, but he laid
down outlines of the faith, on the basis of
Scripture, which remain unshaken. He maintained the true and perfect manhood of Christ,
subject to the conditions of natural growth,
against all forms of Docetism; and, on the other
hand, the true and perfect divinity of the" GodWord" (Bets X6yos), so united with "the man
Christ Jesus " through the human soul as to
be one person, against all forms of Ebionism
and Patripassionism 


<I>(ib. ii. 6, ~).</I>

</P>
<P>

His doctrine of the Incarnation of the GodWord rests in part upon his doctrine of the
Godhead. "All," he held, " who are born
again unto salvation have need of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, and would not obtain
salvation unless the Trinity were entire "


<I>(ib. i. 3, 5). </I>


Hence he speaks of baptism as
" the beginning and fountain of divine gifts
to him who offers himself to the divinity of
the power of the invocations of the adorable
Trinity" 


(rWV 


r* 7rpOQKUY7rr~s rptd5os i7rcKX$QewV) 


<I>(in Joh. vi. i7). </I>


But there is,
in his judgment, a difference in the extent of
the action of the Persons in the Holy Trinity.
The Father, " holding all things together,
reaches (&cent;6dvei) to each being, imparting
being to each from that which is His own, for
He is absolutely (lbv y&amp;p lorw). The Son is
less than the Father (bXdrrwv 7rcypa r. 7r.),
reaching only to rational beings, for He is
second to the Father; and, further, the Holy
Spirit is less (Jrrop), and extends (BLLKV06AEVOY)
to the saints only. So that in this respect
(Kard rovro) the power of the Father is
greater in comparison with (7rapfi) the Son and
the Holy Spirit; and that of the Son more in
comparison with the Holy Spirit; and, again,
the power of the Holy Spirit more exceeding
(8tao~povo-a uaXXop) in comparison with all
other holy beings." To rightly understand
this passage it is necessary to observe that
Origen is not speaking of the essence of the
Persons of the Godhead, but of their manifestation to creatures (cf. 


<I>de Princ. i. 3, 7).
</I>


Essentially the three Persons are of one Godhead, and eternal. The subordination which&#39;
Origen teaches is not of essence but of person
and office. His aim is to realize the Father as
the one Fountain of Godhead, while vindicating true deity for the Son and the Holy Spirit.
In this respect he worked out first the thought
of " the eternal generation " of the Son, which
was accepted from him by the Catholic church
as the truest human expression of one side of
the mystery of the essential Trinity.

</P>

The peculiar connexion which Origen re-
<P>


=s between the Son (the God Word~ and
I beings establishes (so to speak the
fitness of the Incarnation. The Son stood in
a certain affinity with rational souls; and the
human soul with which He was united in the
Incarnation had alone remained absolutely
pure, by the exercise of free choice, in its preexistence 


<I>(ib. ii. 6, 5). </I>


Through this union all
human nature was capable of being glorified,
without violating its characteristic limitations
(cf. c. Cels. iii. 4i f.). The body of Christ was
perfect no less than His soul 


<I>(ib. i. 32 </I>


f.),

</P>


ORIGENES

<P>


The work of Christ was, Origen emphatically
maintained, for all men and for the whole
of man (cf. 0. iii. 


<I>r7; iv. 3 </I>


f.). It was therefore so revealed that it could be apprehended
according to the several powers and wants of
believers 


<I>(in Matt. </I>


t. 


<I>xii. 36, </I>


41, xv. 


<I>241, xvii.
ig ; c. Cels. iv. 15, vi. 68 ; in Joh. ii. r2).
</I>


Christ became, in a transcendent sense, " all
things to all men" 


<I>(de Princ. iv. 3r ; in Joh.
</I>


t. xix. 


<I>r, xx. 28 </I>


; Cf


. c. 


<I>Cell. iii. 7g).</I>

</P>
<P>

Origen thus insists on the efficacy of Christ&#39;s
work for the consummation of humanity and
of the individual, as a victory over every
power of evil. He dwells no less earnestly
upon the value of the life and death of Christ
as a vicarious sacrifice for sin. He seeks
illustrations of the general idea of the power
of vicarious sufferings in Gentile stories of selfsacrifice (c. 


<I>Cels. i. 3i), </I>


and extends it to the
case of martyrs 


<I>(Exh. ad Mart. c. 42 </I>


; Cf


. 


<I>in
Joh. </I>


t. vi. 


<I>36; xxviii. r4). </I>


Though he does
not `attempt to explain how the sacrifice of
Christ was efficacious, he frequently presents
it as a ransom given to redeem man from
Satan, to whom sin had made man a debtor.
Christ, in His own person, freely paid the debt,
by bearing the utmost punishment of sin, and
so set man free, " giving His soul (~vx75) as a
ransom for him " (in 


<I>Matt. </I>


t. xvi. 


<I>8 ; in Rom.
ii. 13, p. r4o L. ; Comm. Ser. in Matt. &sect; x35).
</I>


At other times he regards it as a propitiation
for the divine remission of sins (Hom. 


<I>2n Num.
xxiv. i ; in Lev. i. 3 ; cf</I>


. c. 


<I>Cels. vii. i7).</I>

</P>
<P>

Origen held that the death of Christ was
of avail for heavenly beings, if not for the
expiation of sin yet for advancement in
blessedness 


<I>(Hom. </I>


an 


<I>Lea. i. 3, ii. 3 ; in Rom.

<I>4o9 </I>


L. ; ib. i. 4 ; H


<I>om. </I>


in 


<I>Luc. x.).
</I>


Thus in a true sense angels themselves were
disciples of Christ (in Matt. t. xv. 7). At
times indeed Origen speaks as if he supposed
that the Word was actually manifested to
other orders of being in a manner corresponding to their nature, even as He was revealed
as soul to the souls in Hades (Set. in Ps. iii. 5,
xi. p. 42o L.). In this sense also he thinks
that " He became all things to all," an angel
to angels (in Joh. t. i. 


<I>34) </I>


; and he does not
shrink from allowing that His passion may
be made available, perhaps in some other
shape, in the spiritual world (de Princ. iv.
frag. Gr. 


2 


; Cf


. iv. 25, L.).

</P>
<P>

The work of the Holy Spirit, according to
Origen, is fulfilled in believers. His office is
specially to guide to the fuller truth, which is
the inspiration of nobler life. Through Him
revelation comes home to men. He lays open
the deeper meanings of the word. Through
Him, " Who proceeds from the Father," all
things are sanctified (de Princ. iii. 5, 8).
Through Him every divine gift, wrought by
the Father and ministered by the Son, gains
its individual efficiency (in Joh. t. ii. 6). Thus
there is a unity in the divine operations, which
tends to establish a unity in created bemg s.

The 


<I>Consummation of </I>


Being.-These
characteristic lines of speculation lead to Origen&#39;s view of the consummation of things. All
human thought must fail in the endeavour to
give distinctness to a conception which ought
to embrace the ideas of perfect rest and perfect


body completes the full transfiguration, with


out loss, of all that 


belongs 


to his 


true self;
and he begins a nobler development of body
and soul-moral, intellectual, spiritual-by
which he is brought nearer to the throne of
God (cf. ib. i. 3, 


<I>8 ; in Matt. Comm. Ser. &sect; 51 </I>


;


<I>Hom. i. in Ps. xxxviii. &sect; 8). </I>


The relationships
of earth come to an end (in 


<I>Matt. </I>


t. xvii. 33

</P>
<P>

on this point Origen is not consistent). The
visible ceases, and men enjoy the eternal, for
which now they hope 


<I>(in Rom. vii. </I>


5). Thus
human interest is removed from the present
earth to its heavenly antitype. It is probably
due to this peculiarity of his teaching that
Origen nowhere dwells on the doctrine of
Christ&#39;s return, which occupies a large place
in most schemes of Christian belief. The
coming of Christ in glory is treated as the
spiritual revelation of His true nature 


<I>(de
Princ. iv. </I>


25), though Origen says that he by
no means rejects " the second presence
(emE77p,ta) of the Son of God more simply
understood " (in 


<I>Matt. t. xii. </I>


30).

</P>
<P>

CHARACTERISTICS.-It cannot be surprising
that Origen failed to give a consistent and
harmonious embodiment to his speculations.
His writings represent an aspiration rather
than a system, principles of research and hope
rather than determined formulas; and his
enthusiasm continually mars the proportion
of his work. His theorizing needs the discipline of active life, without which there
can be no real appreciation of history or of
the historical development of truth. Yet
even in regard to the practical apprehension
of the divine education of the world it is only
necessary to compare him on one side with
Philo and on the other with Augustine, to feel
how his grasp of the significance of the Incarnation gave him a sovereign power to
understand the meaning and destiny of life.

</P>
<P>

While ready to fully acknowledge the
claims of reason (cf. 


<I>Hom. in Luc. i. p. 88 L.),
</I>


Origen lays stress on the new data given by
revelation to the solution of the problems of
philosophy 


<I>(de Pyinc i. </I>


5, q.). He points out
repeatedly the insufficiency of reason, of the
independent faculties of man, to attain that
towards which it is turned. Reason enables
man to recognize God when He makes Himself known, to receive a revelation from Him
in virtue of his affinity with the Divine Word,
but it does not enable the creature to derive
from within the longed-for knowledge. The
capacity for knowing God belongs to man as
man, and not to man as a philosopher. Origen
therefore acknowledges the nobility of Plato&#39;s
saying that " it is a hard matter to find --the Maker and Father of the Universe, and
impossible for one who has found Him to
declare Him to all men." But he adds that
Plato affirms too much and too little (c. Cels.
vii. q3). As Christians "we declare that
human nature is not in itself competent in any
way to seek God and find Him purely without
the help of Him Who is sought, of Him Who
is found by those who confess after they have
done all in their power that they have yet
need of Him. . ." (cf. Clem. Al. 


<I>Cohort. &sect; 6).</I>

life. Origen&#39;s opinions are further embarrassed by the constant confusion 


which 


arises
from the intermingling of ideas which belong
to the close of the present order (aicw) and the
close of all things. It is again impossible to
see clearly how the inalienable freedom of
rational beings, which, originally led to the
Fall, can be so disciplined as to bring them
at last to perfect harmony. This, however,
Origen holds; and though he is unable to
realize the form of future purification, through
which souls left unpurified by earthly existence mil be cleansed hereafter, he clings to
the belief that " the end must be like the be.
ginning " (de 


<I>Pyinc. i. 6, z), </I>


a perfect unity in
God. From this he excludes no rational
creature. The evil spirits which fell have not
lost that spirit by which they are akin to God,
which in its essence is inaccessible to evil 


<I>(in
Joh. xxxii. </I>


<I>II, dpErLSEKTOV TCJV xECpGvCJY </I>


TO
7rve"uAa rou 


<I>dvBpwrov), </I>


though it can be overgrown and overpowered (cf. 


<I>de Pyinc. i. 8, </I>


3).
And, on the other hand, freedom remains
even when perfect rest has been reached, and
m this Ongen appears to find the possibility of
future declensions (ib. ii. 3, 3, 


<I>fyag. Gr. ii. </I>


2).
Whether matter, the medium through which
rational freedom finds expression (ib. iv. 35),
will at last cease to be, or be infinitely spiritualized, he leaves undetermined. The question is beyond man&#39;s powers (ib. i. 


<I>6, </I>


q ; ii. 2 ;
ii. 3, 3 ; iii. 


<I>6, r), </I>


though man cannot but ponder
upon it 


<I>(ib. i. 6, r </I>


f.; iii. 4, 5 s. f.). So he presents, in imaginary outlines, the picture of
the soul&#39;s progress through various scenes of
chastisement or illumination 


<I>(ib. i. 6, 3 ; iii. 6,
6 ; iii. </I>


5, 


<I>6 </I>


ff., and Redepenning&#39;s note), till he
can rest in the thought of a restoration in
which law and freedom, justice and love, are
brought to a perfect harmony (cf. 


<I>de Orat. </I>


<I>&sect; 27,
p. 227 </I>


L.). This thought assists Origen in
forming a theory of future punishments. All
future punishments exactly answer to individual sinfulness 


<I>(in Matt. Comm. Ser. &sect; r6),
</I>


and, like those on earth, are directed to the
amendment of the sufferers (c. 


<I>Cels. iv. ro;
Hom. in Fzech. v. r). </I>


Lighter offences can be
chastised on earth; the heavier remain to be
visited hereafter 


<I>(Hom. in Lev. xiv. 4). </I>


In
every case the uttermost farthing must be
paid, though final deliverance is promised 


<I>(in
Rom. v. z f</I>


.). Origen looked forward to a
fiery ordeal, through which men should pass
in the world to come. Every one already
baptized with water and Spirit would, he
thought, if he needed cleansing, be baptized
by the Lord Jesus in a river of fire, and so
purified enter into paradise 


<I>(Hom. in Luc.
</I>


xxiv.). In this sense also he looked forward
to a (spiritual) conflagration of the world, by
which all beings in need of such discipline
should be at once chastised and healed (c.
Cels, v. 15; cf. iv. 


<I>r3).</I>

</P>
<P>

On the other hand, since the future state is
the direct fruit of this, there are, so Origen
held, varieties of blessedness in heaven 


<I>(in
Rom. iv. rz), </I>


corresponding to the life of
saints 


<I>(ib. ix. 3, p. 303), </I>


and foreshadowed by
the divisions of Israel 


<I>(Hom. in Num. i. 3 ;
xxviii. z ; Hom. in </I>


JOS- 


xxv. 4). Speaking
generally, the believer after death enters a
state of fuller knowledge and loftier progress


<I>ode Pyinc. ii. rr, 6). </I>


The resurrection of the

gravest errors are attempts to solve the insoluble. The question of the origin of the


<I>soul, e.g., is </I>


still beset by thedifficulties Origen
sought to meet, but they are ignored. So too
with regard to his speculations on an endless
succession of worlds. Thought must break
down soon in the attempt to co-ordinate the
finite and the infinite. But with whatever
errors in detail, Origen laid down the true
lines on which the Christian apologist must
defend the faith against Polytheism, Judaism,
Gnosticism, Materialism. These forms of
opinion, without the church and within, were
living powers of threatening proportions in his
age, and he vindicated the Gospel against
them as the one absolute revelation, prepared
through the discipline of Israel, historical in
its form, spiritual in its destiny; and the
principles which he affirmed and strove to
illustrate have a present value. They are
fitted to correct the Africanism which, since
Augustine, has dominated Western theology;
and they anticipate many difficulties which
have become prominent in later times. In
the face of existing controversies, it is invigorating to feel that, when as yet no necessity
forced upon him the consideration of the problems now most frequently discussed, a Christian teacher, the master and friend of saints,
taught the moral continuity and destination
of all being, interpreted the sorrows and sadnesses of the world as part of a vast scheme of
purificatory chastisement, found in Holy Scripture not the letter only but a living voice
eloquent with spiritual mysteries, made the
love of truth, in all its amplitude and depth,
the right and end of rational beings, and
reckoned the fuller insight into the mysteries
of nature one of the joys of a future state.

</P>
<P>

Such thoughts bring Origen himself before
us. Of the traits of his personal character
little need be said. He bore unmerited sufferings without a murmur. He lived only to
work. He combined in a signal degree sympathy with zeal. As a controversialist he
sought to win his adversary, not simply to
silence him (cf. Eus. 


<I>H. E. </I>


vi. 33). He had
the boldest confidence in the truth he held
and the tenderest humility as to his own
weakness 


<I>(in Joh. </I>


t. xxxii. 18; 


<I>in Matt. </I>


t.
xvi. r3). When he ventures freely in the
field of interpretations, he asks the support of
the prayers of his hearers. His faith was
catholic, and therefore he welcomed every
kind of knowledge as tributary to its fullness.
It was living, and therefore he knew that no
age could seal any one expression of it as complete. This open-hearted trust kept unchilled to the last the passionate devotion of
his youth. He was therefore enabled to leave
to the church the conviction, attested by a
life of martyrdom, that all things are its
heritage because all things are Christ&#39;s.

vols. of a complete edition of Origen 


<I>(Origenis
opera omnia quae Graece vel Latine tantum
extant et efus nomine circumfeyuntur) </I>


appeared
at Paris in r733, under the editorship of
Charles Delacue, a priest of that society.
Vol. iii. appeared at Paris in r74o, a few
months after the death of the editor (Oct.
1739), who left, however, vol. iv. to the care of

</P>


OROSIUS, PAULUS  793

his nephew C. V. Delarue, who was not able
to issue it till 1759. The service the two
Delarues rendered was great; but their
edition is very far from satisfying the require
ments of scholarship. The collations of MSS.
are fragmentary and even inaccurate; the
text is only partially revised; the notes are
inadequate. Later edd., particularly that of
Lommatsch, have added little. This is the
more to be regretted, as large additions have
been, and are being, made to the Origenian
fragments. These materials have been either
wholly neglected or only partially used in the
latest edd. ; and practically nothing has been
done to improve or illustrate the text. Migne&#39;s
reprint of Delarue, in his 


<I>Patr. Gk. t. xi.-xvii.
</I>


(Paris, r857), has the additions from Galland,
most of those from Mai, and one fragment from
Cramer as a supplement. An ed. of the 


<I>Philoso
</I>


<I>phwm.ena (e codice Payisino), </I>


ed. by E. Miller, is
pub. by the Clar. Press. A new ed. of Origen&#39;s
works is now being pub. in the Berlin collection
of early eccl. Gk. writers; Origen&#39;s 


<I>Werke, i.-ii.
</I>


von P. Koetshau (Leipz. r8gg), vol. iii. ed. by
Klostermann, and vol. iv. ed. by Preusehen
(Berlin, rgo3). A trans. of the 


<I>de Princi.pxis,
</I>


the books 


<I>against Celsus </I>


and the letters, with a
life of Origen, is in z vols. of the
