INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO 
CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA

<P>[a.d. 153-193-217.] The second century of illumination is drawing to a close, 
as the great name of this Father comes into view, and introduces us to a new 
stage of the Church's progress. From Britain to the Ganges it had already made 
its mark. In all its Oriental identity, we have found it vigorous in Gaul and 
penetrating to other regions of the Weir. From its primitive base on the 
Orontes, it has extended itself to the deltas of the Nile; and the Alexandria of 
Apollos and of St. Mark has become the earliest seat of Christian learning. 
There, already, have the catechetical schools gathered the finest intellectual 
trophies of the Cross; and under the aliment of its library springs up something 
like a Christian university. Pantaenus, "the Sicilian bee" from the flowery 
fields of Enna, comes to frame it by his industry, and store it with the sweets 
of his eloquence and wisdom. Clement, who had followed Tatian to the East, 
tracks Pantaenus to Egypt, and comes with his Attic scholarship to be his pupil 
in the school of Christ. After Justin and Irenaeus, he is to be reckoned the 
founder of Christian literature; and it is noteworthy how sublimely he begins to 
treat Paganism as a creed outworn, to be dismissed with contempt, rather than 
seriously wrestled with any longer.</P>
<P>His merciless exposure of the entire system of "lords many and gods many," 
seems to us, indeed, unnecessarily offensive. Why not spare us such details? But 
let us reflect, that, if such are our Christian instincts of delicacy, we owe it 
to this great reformer in no small proportion. For not content to show the 
Pagans that the very atmosphere was polluted by their mythologies, so that 
Christians, turn which way they would, must encounter pestilence, he becomes the 
ethical philosopher of Christians; and while he proceeds to dictate, even in 
minute details, the transformations to which the faithful must subject 
themselves in order "to escape the pollutions of the world," he sketches in 
outline the reformations which the Gospel imposes on society, and which nothing 
but the Gospel has ever enabled mankind to realize. "For with a celerity 
unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access," says Clement, 
"the Divine Power hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation." Socrates 
and Plato had talked sublimely four hundred years before; but Lust and Murder 
were yet the gods of Greece, and men and women were like what they worshipped. 
Clement had been their disciple; but now, as the disciple of Christ, he was to 
exert a power over men and manners, of which they never dreamed.</P>
<P>Alexandria becomes the brain of Christendom: its heart was yet beating at 
Antioch, but the West was still receptive only, its hands and arms stretched 
forth-towards the sunrise for further enlightenment. From the East it had 
obtained the Scriptures and their authentication, and from the same source was 
deriving the canons, the liturgies, and the creed of Christendom. The universal 
language of Christians is Greek. To a pagan emperor who had outgrown the ideas 
of Nero's time, it was no longer Judaism; but it was not less an Oriental 
superstition, essentially Greek in its features and its dress. "All the churches 
of the West," says the historian of Latin Christianity, "were Greek religious colonies. Their 
language was Greek, their organization Greek, their writers Greek, their 
Scriptures and their ritual were Greek. Through Greek, the communications of the 
churches of the West were constantly kept up with the East. ... Thus the Church 
at Rome was but one of a confederation of Greek religious republics rounded by 
Christianity." Now this confederation was the Holy Catholic Church.</P>
<P>Every Christian must recognise the career of Alexander, and the history of 
his empire, as an immediate precursor of the Gospel. The patronage of letters by 
the Ptolemies at Alexandria, the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into the 
dialect of the Hellenes, the creation of a new terminology in the language of 
the Greeks, by which ideas of faith and of truth might find access to the mind 
of a heathen world,-these were preliminaries to the preaching of the Gospel to 
mankind, and to the composition of the New Testament of our Lord and Saviour. He 
Himself had prophetically visited Egypt, and the idols were now to be removed 
before his presence. There a powerful Christian school was to make itself felt 
for ever in the definitions of orthodoxy; and in a new sense was that prophecy 
to be understood, "Out of Egypt have I called my Son."</P>
<P>The genius of Apollos was revived in his native city. A succession of doctors 
was there to arise, like him, "eloquent men, and mighty in the Scriptures." 
Clement tells us of his masters in Christ, and how, coming to Pantaenus, his 
soul was filled with a deathless element of divine knowledge. He speaks of the apostolic tradition as received through his teachers hardly at 
second-hand. He met in that school, no doubt, some, at least, who recalled 
Ignatius and Polycarp; some, perhaps, who as children had heard St. John when he 
could only exhort his congregations to "love one another." He could afterwards 
speak of himself as in the next succession after the apostles.</P>
<P>He became the successor of Pantaenus in the catechetical school, and had 
Origen for his pupil, with other eminent men. He was also ordained a presbyter. 
He seems to have compiled his <I>Stromata</I> in the reigns of Commodus and 
Severus. If, at this time, he was about forty years of age, as seems likely, we 
must conceive of his birth at Athens, while Antoninus Pius was emperor, while 
Polycarp was yet living, and while Justin and Irenaeus were in their prime.</P>
<P>Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, speaks of Clement, in turn, as his master: 
"for we acknowledge as fathers those blessed saints who are gone before us, and 
<I>to whom we shall go after a little time</I>; the truly blest Pantaenus, I 
mean, and the holy Clemens, my teacher, who was to me so greatly useful and 
helpful." St. Cyril of Alexandria calls him "a man admirably learned and 
skilful, and one that searched to the depths all the learning of the Greeks, 
with an exactness rarely attained before." So Theodoret says, "He surpassed all 
others, and <I>was a holy man.</I>" St. Jerome pronounces him the most learned 
of all the ancients; while Eusebius testifies to his theological attainments, 
and applauds him as an "incomparable master of Christian philosophy." But the 
rest shall be narrated by our translator, Mr. Wilson.</P>
<P>The following is the original Introductory Notice:-</P>
<P>Titus Flavius Clemens, the illustrious head of the Catechetical School at 
Alexandria at the close of the second century, was originally a pagan 
philosopher. The date of his birth is unknown. It is also uncertain whether 
Alexandria or Athens was his birthplace. </P>
<P>On embracing Christianity, he eagerly sought the instructions of its most 
eminent teachers; for this purpose travelling extensively over Greece, Italy, 
Egypt, Palestine, and other regions of the East.</P>
<P>Only one of these teachers (who, from a reference in the <I>Stromata</I>, all 
appear to have been alive when he wrote ) can be with certainty identified, viz., Pantaenus, of whom he speaks in terms 
of profound reverence, and whom he describes as the greatest of them all. 
Returning to Alexandria, he succeeded his master Pantaenus in the catechetical 
school, probably on the latter departing on his missionary tour to the East, 
somewhere about a.d. 189. He was also made a presbyter of the Church, either then or somewhat 
later. He continued to teach with great distinction till a.d. 202, when the persecution 
under Severus compelled him to retire from Alexandria. In the beginning of the 
reign of Caracalla we find him at Jerusalem, even then a great resort of 
Christian, and especially clerical, pilgrims. We also hear of him travelling to 
Antioch, furnished with a letter of recommendation by Alexander, bishop of 
Jerusalem. The dose of his career is covered with obscurity. He is supposed to have died 
about a.d. 220.</P>
<P>Among his pupils were his distinguished successor in the Alexandrian school, 
Origen, Alexander bishop of Jerusalem, and, according to Baronius, Combefisius, 
and Bull, also Hippolytus.</P>
<P>The above is positively the sum of what we know of Clement's history.</P>
<P>His three great works, <I>The Exhortation to the Heathen</I> (<FONT 
face=SPIonic>lo/goj o9 protreptiko\ j pro\ s #Ellhnaj</FONT>), <I>The 
Instructor, or Paedagogus</I> (<FONT face=SPIonic>paidagwgo/j</FONT>), <I>The 
Miscellanies</I>, or <I>Stromata</I> (<FONT face=SPIonic>Strwmatei=j</FONT>), 
are among the most valuable remains of Christian antiquity, and the largest that 
belong to that early period.</P>
<P><I>The Exhortation</I>, the object of which is to win pagans to the Christian 
faith, contains a complete and withering exposure of the abominable 
licentiousness, the gross imposture and sordidness of paganism. With clearness 
and cogency of argument, great earnestness and eloquence, Clement sets forth in 
contrast the truth as taught in the inspired Scriptures, the true God, and 
especially the personal Christ, the living Word of God, the Saviour of men. It 
is an elaborate and masterly work, rich in felicitous classical allusion and 
quotation, breathing throughout the spirit of philosophy and of the Gospel, and 
abounding in passages of power and beauty.</P>
<P>The <I>Paedagogus, or Instructor</I>, is addressed to those who have been 
rescued from the darkness and pollutions of heathenism, and is an exhibition of 
Christian morals and manners,-a guide for the formation and development of 
Christian character, and for living a Christian life. It consists of three 
books. It is the grand aim of the whole work to set before the converts Christ 
as the only Instructor, and to expound and enforce His precepts. In the first 
book Clement exhibits the person, the function, the means, methods, and ends of 
the Instructor, who is the Word and Son of God; and lovingly dwells on His 
benignity and philanthropy, His wisdom, faithfulness, and righteousness.</P>
<P>The second and third books lay down rules for the regulation of the 
Christian, in all the relations, circumstances, and actions of life, entering 
most minutely into the details of dress, eating, drinking, bathing, sleeping, 
etc. The delineation of a life in all respects agreeable to the Word, a truly 
Christian life, attempted here, may, now that the Gospel has transformed social 
and private life to the extent it has, appear unnecessary, or a proof of the 
influence of ascetic tendencies. But a code of Christian morals and manners (a 
sort of "whole duty of man" and manual of good breeding combined) was eminently 
needed by those whose habits and characters had been moulded under the debasing 
and polluting influences of heathenism; and who were bound, and were aiming, to 
shape their lives according to the principles of the Gospel, in the midst of the 
all but incredible licentiousness and luxury by which society around was 
incurably tainted. The disclosures which Clement, with solemn sternness, and 
often with caustic wit, makes of the prevalent voluptuousness and vice, form a 
very valuable contribution to our knowledge of that period.</P>
<P>The full title of the <I>Stromata</I>, according to Eusebius and Photius, was 
<FONT face=SPIonic>Ti/tou Flaui/ou Klh/mentoj tw=n kata\ th\ n a0lhqh= 
filosofi/an gnwstikw=n u9pomnhma/twn strwmatei=j</FONT> -"Titus Flavius Clement's miscellaneous collections of speculative (gnostic) 
notes bearing upon the true philosophy." The aim of the work, in accordance with 
this title, is, in opposition to Gnosticism, to furnish the materials for the 
construction of a true gnosis, a Christian philosophy, on the basis of faith, 
and to lead on to this higher knowledge those who, by the discipline of the 
Paedagogus, had been trained for it. The work consisted originally of eight 
books. The eighth book is lost; that which appears under this name has plainly 
no connection with the rest of the <I>Stromata</I>. Various accounts have been 
given of the meaning of the distinctive word in the title (<FONT 
face=SPIonic>Strwmateu/j</FONT>); but all agree in regarding it as indicating 
the miscellaneous character of its contents. And they are very miscellaneous. 
They consist of the speculations of Greek philosophers, of heretics, and of 
those who cultivated the true Christian gnosis, and of quotations from sacred 
Scripture. The latter he affirms to be the source from which the higher 
Christian knowledge is to be drawn; as it was that from which the germs of truth 
in Plato and the Hellenic philosophy were derived. He describes philosophy as a 
divinely ordered preparation of the Greeks for faith in Christ, as the law was 
for the Hebrews; and shows the necessity and value of literature and philosophic 
culture for the attainment of true Christian knowledge, in opposition to the 
numerous body among Christians who regarded learning as useless and dangerous. 
He proclaims himself an eclectic, believing in the existence of fragments of 
truth in all systems, which may be separated from error; but declaring that the 
truth can be found in unity and completeness only in Christ, as it was from Him 
that all its scattered germs originally proceeded. The <I>Stromata</I> are 
written carelessly, and even confusedly; but the work is one of prodigious 
learning, and supplies materials of the greatest value for understanding the 
various conflicting systems which Christianity had to combat.</P>
<P>It was regarded so much as the author's great work, that, on the testimony of 
Theodoret, Cassiodorus, and others, we learn that Clement received the 
appellation of<FONT face=SPIonic>Strwmateu/j</FONT> (the Stromatist). In all 
probability, the first part of it was given to the world about a.d. 194. The 
latest date to which he brings down his chronology in the first book is the 
death of Commodus, which happened in a.d. 192; from which Eusebius concludes that he wrote this work during the reign of Severus, who ascended the 
imperial throne in a.d. 193, and reigned till a.d. 211. It is likely that the 
whole was composed ere Clement quitted Alexandria in a.d. 202. The publication 
of the <I>Paedagogus</I> preceded by a short time that of the <I>Stromata</I>; 
and the <I>Cohortatio</I> was written a short time before the <I>Paedagogus</I>, 
as is clear from statements made by Clement himself.</P>
<P>So multifarious is the erudition, so multitudinous are the quotations and the 
references to authors in all departments, and of all countries, the most of 
whose works have perished, that the works in question could only have been 
composed near an extensive library-hardly anywhere but in the vicinity of the 
famous library of Alexandria. They are a storehouse of curious ancient lore,-a 
museum of the fossil remains of the beauties and monstrosities of the world of 
pagan antiquity, during all the epochs and phases of its history. The three 
compositions are really parts of one whole. The central connecting idea is that 
of the Logos-the Word-the Son of God; whom in the first work he exhibits drawing 
men from the superstitions and corruptions of heathenism to faith; in the 
second, as training them by precepts and discipline; and in the last, as 
conducting them to that higher knowledge of the things of God, to which those 
only who devote themselves assiduously to spiritual, moral, and intellectual 
culture can attain. Ever before his eye is the grand form of the living personal 
Christ,-the Word, who "was with God, and who was God, but who became man, and 
dwelt among us." </P>
<P>Of course there is throughout plenty Of false science, and frivolous and 
fanciful speculation.</P>
<P><I>Who is the rich man that shall be saved?</I> (<FONT face=SPIonic>ti/j o9 
swzo/menoj plou/sioj</FONT>; ) is the title of a practical treatise, in which 
Clement shows, in opposition to those who interpreted our Lord's words to the 
young ruler as requiring the renunciation of worldly goods, that the disposition 
of the soul is the great essential. Of other numerous works of Clement, of which 
only a few stray fragments have been preserved, the chief are the eight books of 
<I>The Hypotyposes</I>, which consisted of expositions of all the books of 
Scripture. Of these we have a few undoubted fragments. <I>The Adumbrations</I>, 
or <I>Commentaries on some of the Catholic Epistles</I>, and <I>The Selections 
from the Prophetic Scriptures</I>, are compositions of the same character, as 
far as we can judge, as <I>The Hypotyposes</I>, and are supposed by some to have 
formed part of that work.</P>
<P>Other lost works of Clement are :-</P>
<UL>
  <P>The Treatise of Clement, the Stromatist, on the Prophet Amos.</P>
  <P>On Providence.</P>
  <P>Treatise on Easter.</P>
  <P>On Evil-speaking.</P>
  <P>Discussion on Fasting.</P>
  <P>Exhortation to Patience; or, To the newly baptized.Ecclesiastical Canon; 
  or, Against the Judaizers.</P></UL>
<P>Different Terms.</P>
<P>The following are the names of treatises which Clement refers to as written 
or about to be written by him, but of which otherwise we have no trace or 
mention :-<I>On First Principles; On Prophecy; On the Allegorical Interpretation 
of Members and Affections when ascribed to God; On Angels; On the Devil; On the 
Origin of the Universe; On the Unity and Excellence of the Church; On the 
Offices of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Widows; On the Saul; On the 
Resurrection; On Marriage; On Continence; Against Heresies.</I></P>
<P>Preserved among Clement's works is a fragment called <I>Epitomes of the 
Writings of Theodotus, and of the Eastern Doctrine</I>, most likely abridged 
extracts made by Clement for his own use, and giving considerable insight into 
Gnosticism.</P>
<P>Clement's quotations from Scripture are made from the Septuagint version, 
often inaccurately from memory, sometimes from a different text from what we 
possess, often with verbal adaptations; and not rarely different texts are 
blended together. </P>
<P>The works of Clement present considerable difficulties to the translator; and 
one of the chief is the state of the text, which greatly needs to be expurgated 
and amended. For this there are abundant materials, in the copious annotations 
and disquisitions, by various hands, collected together in Migne's edition; 
where, however, corruptions the most obvious have been allowed to remain in the 
text.</P>
<P>The publishers are indebted to Dr. W. L. Alexander for the poetical 
translations of the Hymns of Clement. </P>
