Introductory Notice to 
Hippolytus

<P>[a.d. 170-236.]The first great Christian Father whose history is Roman is, 
nevertheless, not a Roman, but a Greek. He is the disciple of Irenaeus, and the 
spirit of his life-work rejects that of his master. In his personal character he 
so much resembles Irenaeus risen again, that the great Bishop of Lyons must be well studied and understood if we would 
do full justice to the conduct of Hippolytus. Especially did he follow his 
master's example in withstanding contemporary bishops of Rome, who, like Victor, 
"deserved to be blamed," but who, much more than any of their predecessors, 
merited rebuke alike for error in doctrine and viciousness of life.</P>
<P>In the year 1551, while some excavations were in progress near the ancient 
Church of St. Lawrence at Rome, on the Tiburtine Road, there was found an 
ancient statue, in marble, of a figure seated in a chair, and wearing over the 
Roman tunic the <I>pallium</I> of Tertullian's eulogy. It was in 1851, just 
three hundred years after its discovery, and in the year of the publication of 
the newly discovered <I>Philosophumena</I> at Oxford, that I saw it in the 
Vatican. As a specimen of early Christian art it is a most interesting work, and 
possesses a higher merit than almost any similar production of a period 
subsequent to that of the Antonines. It represents a grave personage, of noble features and a high, commanding 
forehead, slightly bearded, his right hand resting over his heart, while under 
it his left arm crosses the body to reach a book placed at his side. There is no 
reason to doubt that this is, indeed, the statue of Hippolytus, as is stated in 
the inscription of Pius IV., who calls him "Saint Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus," 
and states that he lived in the reign of the Emperor Alexander; i.e., 
Severus.</P>
<P>Of this there is evidence on the chair itself, which represents his episcopal 
<I>cathedra</I>, and has a modest symbol of lions at "the stays," as if borrowed 
from the throne of Solomon. It is a work of later date than the age of Severus, 
no doubt; but Wordsworth, who admirably illustrates the means by which such a 
statue may have been provided, gives us good reasons for supposing that it may 
have been the grateful tribute of contemporaries, and all the more trustworthy 
as a portrait of the man himself. The chair has carved upon it, no doubt for use 
in the Church, a calendar indicating the Paschal full moons for seven cycles of 
sixteen years each; answering, according to the science of the period, to 
similar tables in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It indicates the days on 
which Easter must fall, from a.d. 222 to a.d. 333. On the back of the chair is a 
list of the author's works. </P>
<P>Not less interesting, and vastly more important, was the discovery, at Mount 
Athos, in 1842, of the long-lost <I>Philosophumena</I> of this author, 
concerning which the important facts will appear below. Its learned editor, 
Emmanuel Miller, published it at Oxford under the name of Origen, which was 
inscribed on the Ms. Like the Epistle of Clement, its composition in the Greek 
language had given it currency among the Easterns long after it was forgotten in 
the West; and very naturally they had ascribed to Origen an anonymous treatise 
containing much in coincidence with his teachings, and supplying the place of 
one of his works of a similar kind. It is now sufficiently established as the 
work of Hippolytus, and has been providentially brought to light just when it 
was most needed. In fact, the statue rose from its grave as if to rebuke the reigning pontiff 
(Pius IV.), who just then imposed upon the Latin churches the novel "Creed" 
which bears his name; and now the <I>Philosophumena</I> comes forth as if to 
breathe a last warning to that namesake of the former Pius who, in the very 
teeth of its testimony, so recently forged and uttered the dogma of "papal 
infallibility" conferring this attribute upon himself, and retrospectively upon 
the very bishops of Rome whom St. Hippolytus resisted as heretics, and has 
transmitted to posterity, in his writings, branded with the shame alike of false 
doctrine and of heinous crimes. Dr. Dollinger, who for a time lent his learning 
and genius to an apologetic effort in behalf of the Papacy, was no doubt 
prepared, by this very struggle of his heart <I>versus</I> head, for that 
rejection of the new dogma which overloaded alike his intellect and his 
conscience, and made it impossible for him any longer to bear the lashes of 
Rehoboam in communion with modern Rome.</P>
<P>In the biographical <I>data</I> which will be found below, enough is supplied 
for the needs of the reader of the present series, who, if he wishes further to 
investigate the subject, will find the fullest information in the works to which 
reference has been made, or which will be hereafter indicated. But this is the place to recur to the much-abused passage of Irenaeus which I 
have discussed in a former volume. Strange to say, I was forced to correct, from a Roman-Catholic writer, the very 
unsatisfactory rendering of our Edinburgh editors, and to elucidate at some 
length the palpable absurdity of attributing to Irenaeus any other than a 
geographical and imperial reference to the importance of Rome, and its 
usefulness to the West, more especially, as its only see of apostolic origin. 
Quoting the Ninth Antiochian Canon, I gave good reasons for my conjecture that 
the Latin <I>convenire</I> represents <FONT face=SPIonic>suntrexein</FONT> in 
the original; and now it remains to be noted how strongly the real meaning of 
Irenaeus is illustrated in the life and services of his pupil Hippolytus.</P>
<P>1. That neither Hippolytus nor his master had any conception that the See of 
Rome possesses any pre-eminent authority, to which others are obliged to defer, 
is conspicuously evident from the history of both. Alike they convicted Roman 
bishops of error, and alike they rebuked them for their misconduct.</P>
<P>2. Hippolytus is the author of a work called the <I>Little Labyrinth</I>, 
which, like the recently discovered <I>Philosophumena</I>, attributes to the 
Roman See anything but the "infallibility" which the quotation from Irenaeus is 
so ingeniously wrested to sustain. How he did <I>not</I> understand the passage is, therefore, sufficiently 
apparent. Let us next inquire what appears, from his conduct, to be the true 
understanding of Irenaeus.</P>
<P>3. I have shown, in the elucidation already referred to, how Irenaeus affirms 
that Rome is the city which everybody visits from all parts, and that 
Christians, resorting thither, because it is the Imperial City, <I>carry into 
it</I> the testimony of all other churches. Thus it becomes a competent witness 
to the <I>quod ab omnibus</I>, because it cannot be ignorant of what all the 
churches teach with one accord. This argument, therefore, reverses the modern 
Roman dogma; primitive Rome <I>received</I> orthodoxy instead of prescribing it. 
She embosomed the Catholic testimony <I>brought into</I> it from all the 
churches, and gave it forth as reflected light; not primarily her own, but what 
she faithfully preserved in coincidence with older and more learned churches 
than herself. Doubtless she had been planted and watered by St. Paul and St. 
Peter; but doubtless, also, she had been expressly warned by the former of her 
liability to error and to final severance from apostolic communion. Hippolytus lived at a critical moment, when this awful 
admonition seemed about to be realized.</P>
<P>4. Now, then, from Portus and from Lyons, Hippolytus brought into Rome the 
Catholic doctrine, and convicted two of its bishops of pernicious heresies and 
evil living. And thus, as Irenaeus teaches, the faith was preserved in Rome by 
the testimony of those <I>from every side resorting thither</I>, not by any 
prerogative of the See itself. All this will appear clearly enough as the 
student proceeds in the examination of this volume. But it is now time to avail 
ourselves of the information given us by the translator in his Introductory 
Notice, as follows:-</P>
<P>The entire of <I>The Refutation of all Heresies</I>, with the exception of 
book i., was found in a ms. brought from a convent on Mount Athos so recently as 
the year 1842. The discoverer of this treasure-for treasure it certainly is-was 
Minoides Mynas, an erudite Greek, who had visited his native country in search 
of ancient mss., by direction of M. Abel Villemain, Minister of Public 
Instruction under Louis Philippe. The French Government have thus the credit of 
being instrumental in bringing to light this valuable work, while the University 
of Oxford shares the distinction by being its earliest publishers. <I>The 
Refutation</I> was printed at the Clarendon Press in 1851, under the editorship 
of M. Emmanuel Miller, whose labours have proved serviceable to all subsequent commentators. One 
generally acknowledged mistake was committed by Miller in ascribing the work to 
Origen. He was right in affirming that the discovered ms. was the continuation 
of the fragment, <I>The Philosophumena</I>, inserted in the Benedictine copy of 
Origen's works. In the volume, however, containing the <I>Philosophumena</I>, we 
have dissertations by Huet, in which he questions Origen's authorship in favour 
of Epiphanius. Heuman attributed the <I>Philosophumena</I> to Didymus of 
Alexandria, Gale to Aetius; and it, with the rest of <I>The Refutation</I>, Fessler and Baur ascribed to 
Caius, but the Abbe Jellabert to Tertullian. The last hypothesis is untenable, 
if for no other reason, because the work is in Greek. In many respects, Caius, 
who was a presbyter of Rome in the time of Victor and Zephyrinus, would seem the 
probable author; but a fatal argument-one applicable to those named above, 
except Epiphanius-against Caius is his not being, as the author of <I>The 
Refutation</I> in the <I>Proemium</I> declares himself to be, a bishop. 
Epiphanius no doubt filled the episcopal office; but when we have a large work 
of his on the heresies, with a summary, it would seem scarcely probable that he composed likewise, on the same topic, an 
extended treatise like the present, with two abridgments. Whatever diversity of 
opinion, however, existed as to these claimants, most critics, though not all, 
now agree in denying the authorship of Origen. Neither the style nor tone of 
<I>The Refutation</I> is Origenian. Its compilatory process is foreign to 
Origen's plan of composition; while the subject matter itself, for many reasons, 
would not be likely to have occupied the pen of the Alexandrine Father. It is 
almost impossible but that Origen would have made some allusions in <I>The 
Refutation</I> to his other writings, or in them to it. Not only, however, is 
there no such allusion, but the derivation of the word "Ebionites," in <I>The 
Refutation</I>, and an expressed belief in the (orthodox) doctrine of eternal 
punishment, are at variance with Origen's authorship. Again, no work answering 
the description is awarded to Origen in catalogues of his extant or lost 
writings. These arguments are strengthened by the facts, that Origen was never a 
bishop, and that he did not reside for any length of time at Rome. He once paid 
a hurried visit to the capital of the West, whereas the author of <I>The 
Refutation</I> asserts his presence at Rome during the occurrence of events 
which occupied a period of some twenty years. And not only was he a spectator, 
but took part in these transactions in such an official and authoritative manner 
as Origen could never have assumed, either at Rome or elsewhere. </P>
<P>In this state of the controversy, commentators turned their attention towards 
Hippolytus, in favour of whose authorship the majority of modern scholars have 
decided. The arguments that have led to this conclusion, and those alleged by 
others against it, could not be adequately discussed in a notice like the 
present. Suffice it to say, that such names as Jacobi, Gieseler, Duncker, 
Schneidewin, Bernays, Bunsen, Wordsworth, and Dollinger, support the claims of 
Hippolytus. The testimony of Dr. Dollinger, considering the extent of his 
theological learning, and in particular his intimate acquaintance with the 
apostolic period in church history, virtually, we submit, decides the 
question. </P>
<P>For a biography of Hippolytus we have not much authentic materials. There can 
be no reasonable doubt but that he was a bishop, and passed the greater portion 
of his life in Rome and its vicinity. This assertion corresponds with the 
conclusion adopted by Dr. Dollinger, who, however, refuses to allow that 
Hippolytus was, as is generally maintained, Bishop of Portus, a harbour of Rome 
at the northern mouth of the Tiber, opposite Ostia. However, it is satisfactory 
to establish, and especially upon such eminent authority as that of Dr. 
Dollinger, the fact of Hippolytus' connection with the Western Church, not only 
because it bears on the investigation of the authorship of <I>The 
Refutation</I>, the writer of which affirms his personal observation of what he 
records as occurring in his own time at Rome, but also because it overthrows the 
hypothesis of those who contend that there were more Hippolytuses than one-Dr. 
Dollinger shows that there is only one historical Hippolytus-or that the East, 
and not Italy, was the sphere of his episcopal labours. Thus Le Moyne, in the 
seventeenth century, a French writer resident in Leyden, ingeniously argues that 
Hippolytus was bishop of <I>Portus Romanorum</I> (Aden), in Arabia. Le Moyne's 
theory was adopted by some celebrities, viz., Dupin, Tillemont, Spanheim, 
Basnage, and our own Dr. Cave. To this position are opposed, among others, the 
names of Nicephorus, Syncellus, Baronius, Bellarmine, Dodwell, Beveridge, Bull, 
and Archbishop Ussher. The judgment and critical accuracy of Ussher is, on a 
point of this kind, of the highest value. Wherefore the question of Hippolytus 
being bishop of Portus near Rome would also appear established, for the reasons 
laid down in Bunsen's <I>Letters to Archdeacon Hare</I>, and Canon Wordsworth's 
<I>St. Hippolytus</I>. The mind of inquirers appears to have been primarily 
unsettled in consequence of Eusebius' mentioning Hippolytus (<I>Ecclesiast. 
Hist., vi. 10</I>) in company with Beryllus (of Bostra), an Arabian, expressing 
at the same time his uncertainty as to where Hippolytus was bishop. This 
indecision is easily explained, and cannot invalidate the tradition and 
historical testimony which assign the bishopric of Portus near Rome to 
Hippolytus, a saint and martyr of the Church. Of his martyrdom, though the fact 
itself is certain, the details, furnished in Prudentius' hymn, are not historic. 
Thus the mode of Hippolytus' death is stated by Prudentius to have been 
identical with that of Hippolytus the son of Theseus, who was torn limb from 
limb by being tied to wild horses. St. Hippolytus, however, is known on 
historical testimony to have been thrown into a canal and drowned; but whether 
the scene of his martyrdom its Sardinia, to which he undoubtedly banished along 
with the Roman bishop Pontianus, or Rome, or Portus, has not as yet been 
definitively proved. The time of his martyrdom, however, is probably a year or 
two, perhaps less or more, after the commencement of the reign of Maximin the 
Thracian, that is, somewhere about a.d. 235-39. This enables us to determine the 
age of Hippolytus; and as some statements in <I>The Refutation</I> evince the 
work to be the composition of an old man, and as the work itself was written 
after the death of Callistus in a.d. 222, this would transfer the period of his 
birth to not very long after the last half of the second century.</P>
<P>The contents of <I>The Refutation</I>, as they originally stood, seem to have 
been arranged thus: The first book (which we have) contained an account of the 
different schools of ancient philosophers; the second (which is missing), the 
doctrines and mysteries of the Egyptians; the third (likewise missing), the 
Chaldean science and astrology; and the fourth (the beginning of which is 
missing), the system of the Chaldean horoscope, and the magical rites and 
incantations of the Babylonian Theurgists. Next came the portion of the work 
relating more immediately to the heresies of the Church, which is contained in 
books v.-ix. The tenth book is the <I>résumé</I> of the entire, together with 
the exposition of the author's own religious opinions. The heresies enumerated 
by Hippolytus comprehend a period starting from an age prior to the composition 
of St. John's Gospel, and terminating with the death of Callistus. The heresies 
are explained according to chronological development, and may be ranged under 
five leading schools: (1) The Ophites; (1) Simonists; (3) Basilidians; (4) 
Docetae; (5) Noetians. Hippolytus ascends to the origin of heresy, not only in 
assigning heterodoxy a derivative nature from heathenism, but in pointing out in 
the <I>Gnossis</I> elements of abnormal opinions antecedent to the promulgation 
of Christianity. We have thus a most interesting account of the early heresies, 
which in some respects supplies many <I>desiderata</I> in the ecclesiastical 
history of this epoch.</P>
<P>We can scarcely over-estimate the value of <I>The Refutation</I>, on account 
of the propinquity of its author to the apostolic age. Hippolytus was a disciple 
of St. Irenaeus, St. Irenaeus of St. Polycarp, St. Polycarp of St. John. Indeed, 
one fact of grave importance connected with the writings of St. John, is 
elicited from Hippolytus' <I>Refutation</I>. The passage given out of Basilides' 
work, containing a quotation by the heretic from St. John i. g, settles the 
period of the composition of the fourth Gospel, as of greater antiquity by at 
least thirty years than is allowed to it by the Tubingen school. It is therefore 
obvious that Basilides formed his system out of the prologue of St. John's 
Gospel; thus for ever setting at rest the allegation of these critics, that St. 
John's Gospel was written at a later date, and assigned an apostolic author, in 
order to silence the Basilidian Gnostics. In the case of Irenaeus, too, <I>The Refutation</I> has restored the Greek text 
of much of his book Against <I>Heresies</I>, hitherto only known to us in a 
Latin version. Nor is the value of Hippolytus' work seriously impaired, even on 
the supposition of the authorship not being proved,-a concession, however, in no 
wise justified by the evidence. Whoever the writer of <I>The Refutation</I> be, 
he belonged to the early portion of the third century, formed his compilations 
from primitive sources, made conscientious preparation for his undertaking, 
delivered statements confirmed by early writers of note, and lastly, in the execution of his task, furnished indubitable marks of 
information and research, and of having thoroughly mastered the relations and 
affinities, each to other, of the various heresies of the first two and a 
quarter centuries. These heresies, whether deducible from attempts to 
Christianize the philosophy of Paganism, or to interpret the Doctrines and Life 
of our Lord by the tenets of Gnosticism and Oriental speculation generally, or 
to create a compromise with the pretensions of Judaism,-these heresies, amid all 
their complexity and diversity, St. Hippolytus reduces to one common ground of censure-antagonism to Holy Scripture. Heresy, 
thus branded, he leaves to wither under the condemnatory sentence of the 
Church.</P>
