</H2>
<P>
In recent times a key area of interest in New Testament studies has been
the use of sociological models to illuminate New Testament
texts. This is due largely
to a realization that theological reflection never takes place in isolation
from a particular context, and thus that a greater understanding of the context
which produced a given document will illuminate our understanding of that
text, and of why the author felt compelled to address specific issues. Of
particular interest in the study of John is the work of Peter Berger and
Thomas Luckmann, whose work
in the field of the sociology of knowledge has been fruitfully applied to
the study of Luke-Acts by Philip Esler.
 Berger and Luckmann suggest
that a given socio-religious body, in order to maintain its worldview against
objections from within or without, must engage in what they call 'legitimation'
or world-view maintenance. In response to challenges to their understanding
of reality, a community 'legitimates' its beliefs by drawing out the implications
of other beliefs, by finding new proof-texts, and by in various other ways
developing its traditions. In other words, conflict causes belief systems
to develop and grow. Given the general agreement that the Fourth Gospel was
formed in a context of conflict with a local synagogue, and that John's belief
system is more fully developed than that found in other New Testament documents
in precisely the areas that were at the heart of the conflict between the
Johannine community and the synagogue, it would appear that the two may be
related to one another by applying Berger and Luckmann's model. What follows
is an attempt to read John 6:25-71 in light of the Johannine conflict situation,
and to see whether such a sociological reading illuminates the meaning that
this text would have carried to its first readers. In this study, we are
using the terms 'legitimation' and 'apologetic' more or less interchangeably,
because of the ambiguity which surrounds the purpose of the Fourth Gospel
 and because, for the most
part, apologetic works written with the aim of converting unbelievers are
read much more frequently by believers, so that, in practice, apologetic
works primarily serve a legitimating function.
<P>
<H2>
  <FONT COLOR="#1418e5">Sources and Composition</FONT>
</H2>
<P>
There are essentially three main views on the origin and composition of this
chapter:
<P>
(a) The whole chapter (except perhaps for vv51-58) is an integral part of
the original Gospel (although perhaps displaced from before chapter
5).
<P>
(b) The traditional material (vv1-21) was included in the original Signs
Source, while the rest comes from the
Evangelist.
<P>
(c) The whole chapter was composed and added to the second edition of the
Gospel, not having been included in the
first.
<P>
It would obviously be possible to distinguish variations within these headings,
as indeed we felt compelled to do in the case of (a) above. For our purposes,
however, this oversimplified sketch will be more than adequate. The big question
here as everywhere in the Fourth Gospel is that of what criteria may be used
to distinguish between source and redaction.
<P>
It is always best to move from that which is more certain to that which is
less. To begin with, there can be little doubt that the material contained
in the first section of John 6 the author inherited and did not simply compose
himself. Secondly, the transition from chapter 5 to chapter 6, which jumps
from Judaea to Galilee without warning, can hardly be said to be smooth,
and the result has been the appearance of a number of displacement theories.
These two points seem fairly certain, but several different interpretations
of this evidence would appear to be possible. While source theories rightly
draw attention to the traditional nature of the material in John 6:1-21,
this on its own does not prove that this material was actually <I>written
down</I> in the Gospel of Signs, as Fortna
suggests, rather than having
been added together with the discourse material to the last edition of the
Gospel, as Lindars suggests.
It cannot be stressed enough
that the age of material does not automatically determine when it was written
down. On the other hand, Lindars' point about the function of this chapter
as proof that Moses wrote concerning Jesus (John 5:46f) does not necessarily
disprove or exclude Fortna's source theory, nor his suggestion that the
disjunction between chapters 5 and 6 are due to a rearrangement not of the
Gospel in its present form by a redactor, but of the source by the evangelist.
It is possible that both are correct. The evangelist may have moved this
material from the Signs Source to its present position in order to use it
to illustrate the point made in the discourse material he added in John 5:46f,
namely that Moses wrote about Jesus.
<P>
In showing that these two views are not incompatible, our intention is not
to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the various suggestions which have
been made. For the purpose of this study it is sufficient if we have found
some indication of the origin of the material found here, and in doing so
can perhaps detect some of the logic which may have moved the evangelist
to finally put this chapter in the form that he did. The miracle which precedes
the discourse is clearly traditional, and the discourse material bears the
hallmarks of Johannine theology, whether that of the Evangelist or of a redactor.
Beyond this it is unnecessary for us to speculate at present.
<P>
<H2>
  <FONT COLOR="#1516ff">Background</FONT>
</H2>
<P>
The most significant contribution which has been made to the interpretation
of this chapter is certainly that of P.
Borgen. Borgen was the first
to convincingly demonstrate that what is going on in the discourse of John
6 is essentially exegesis of the Jewish Scriptures, following patterns and
principles of exegesis which are widely attested in the sources available
to us. The key to understanding the discussion is thus to realize that the
various words and phrases, many of which are difficult to understand or
interpret, are derived from, and will thus only be understood in light of,
the Old Testament text or texts being discussed. The key passage in John
6 is the Old Testament paraphrase (it is not identical to any exact citation), "He gave them bread
from heaven to eat", and in Borgen's view, Jesus is suggesting an alternative
reading of the Hebrew text, in good rabbinic fashion: 'Do not read 'he [Moses]
gave', but 'he [God] gives'.
The whole discussion between
Jesus and the crowds is then to be regarded as following the typical course
of such exegetical discussions.
<P>
Building on such insights, Barnabas Lindars has pointed out that the discussion
follows the pattern of a synagogue homily, a suggestion which is not at all
surprising or implausible, since the evangelist tells the reader that this
discourse took place in the synagogue at Capernaum
(6:59). Regardless of whether
any historical veracity is to be granted to the statement, the Bread of Life
discourse was at the very least recognized by the evangelist (and probably
also his readers) as reminiscent of the genre of the synagogue homily. The
two passages, Exodus 16:4 and Isa.54:9-55:4, which play a central role in
this chapter, are thus to be regarded as the <I>seder</I> and
<I>haphtarah</I> texts for a homiletic exposition of the Jewish Scriptures.
<P>
It would appear reasonable to follow Lindars in regarding John 6 as essentially
an attempt to demonstrate the truthfulness of the statement made at the end
of John 5: Moses wrote concerning Jesus, and what he wrote finds its fulfilment
in him. The stories concerning the feeding of the multitude and the crossing
of the sea John inherited from the Christian tradition, very possibly as
part of the Signs Document. More needs to be said about a number of other
issues, such as the relationship between this part of John's Gospel and the
practice of the Christian sacraments, in particular the Lord's Supper. However,
such issues are best dealt with in the course of an examination and consideration
of the text itself, to which we will shortly turn.
<P>
<H2>
  <FONT COLOR="#1919ff">Structure and Genre</FONT>
</H2>
<P>
The discourse material in this chapter begins in a way reminiscent of John
4, where Jesus discusses living water with the Samaritan woman. Both
conversations begin with a reference to ordinary food or water (4:7-9; 6:26
in the context of the earlier feeding), to which Jesus responds by referring
to the need to be concerned with eternal food or drink (4:10; 6:27). Jesus'
interlocutor(s) then ask(s) for this eternal water/bread, yet still understanding
it as a permanent form of ordinary food/drink (4:15; 6:34). In both cases,
the water or bread is referred to in terms of 'life' and/or its cognates
('living water', 'bread of life'), which is said to provide eternal life.
It may also be noted that both conversations take place in the context of
a particular OT tradition (in John 4 Jacob's well, in John 6 the manna).
There are also significant similarities between this discourse and the discourse
with Nicodemus in John
3. In both cases Jesus'
interlocutor misunderstands him, and responds with a question containing
<I>pws dunatai</I> (John 3:4; 6:52), to which Jesus responds with a double
'Amen' and a saying beginning with 'unless' (<I>ean mh_</I>; John 3:5; 6:53).
We thus are confronted here with another example of the Johannine dialogue,
which takes a misunderstanding, usually caused by Jesus' use of a term which
can have more than one meaning, and elaborates it.
<P>
In the context of Jesus' words about the need to be concerned about food
that endures for eternal life, and the crowd's request for a sign comparable
to that given in the time of Moses, an inexact quotation from Exod.16:4,
or perhaps from Ps.78:24, is given: "He gave them bread from heaven to eat".
We have already noted the importance of this quotation as providing both
the basis for and the background of the discussion which follows. In the
first part of the discourse, the discussion takes its starting point from
the words in the citation, 'He gave'. It then continues by expounding the
whole citation, in light of the specific understanding of 'he gave' and of
the further text from Isaiah that is also in mind. The whole is thus to be
read primarily, as we have already suggested, as a homiletic exposition of
the Jewish Scriptures.
<P>
vv25-27) In the opening part of the bread of life discourse, the crowd expresses
to Jesus its astonishment at finding him already on the other side of the
lake. Jesus responds with words that are reminiscent of the Old Testament
exegetical tradition relating to the provision of manna, such as is found
in Deut.8:2-3, where it is asserted that "man does not live by bread alone,
but by every word that comes from the mouth of Yahweh". Jesus, in a similar
vein, asserts that the crowd should not seek after ordinary food, but after
food given by the Son of Man which truly gives life, eternal life. The
intertextual echoes provided here at the outset provide an important clue
to the interpretation of what
follows.
<P>
vv28-29) This question by the crowd and the response given by Jesus also
provide an important key to the interpretation of what follows. Here it is
made clear that what is at issue throughout the discourse is the question
of belief in Jesus. Whatever other overtones the language used may have,
the focus is on what Jesus says is the key work required by God: to believe
on the one he has sent. It is also to be pointed out that this issue is
frequently to the fore in documents which arise out of conflict between
Christians and Jews. Throughout the Fourth Gospel, to be part of the people
of God or even to seek to observe the Law is without value if one refuses
to accept God's messenger.
<P>
vv30-31) The crowd now requests a miraculous sign as a validation of Jesus'
status as one sent by God. This is not in and of itself an unreasonable
request, since God had,
according to Exodus 4, worked signs precisely to validate Moses' ministry.
However, there may be a certain amount of irony intended by the author, since
the crowd, at least in the context of the narrative as it now stands, has
seen Jesus provide food miraculously for them, and this request for further
proof of Jesus' status and ability may thus be an indication of unbelief
or of unwillingness to believe. In the context of this discussion, the key
Old Testament quotation/paraphrase which will underlie the rest of the discussion
is given by the crowd: "He gave them bread from heaven to eat".
<P>
It is quite probable that another issue between the Johannine Christians
and their Jewish interlocutors may have influenced the present text. In a
number of places in the rabbinic and other early Jewish literature, the belief
is expressed that the second redeemer (i.e., the Messiah) will perform the
same acts as the first redeemer
(Moses). In Ecclesiastes
Rabbah three specific signs are mentioned, the provision of manna, the provision
of water, and riding on a donkey, and although this text is much later, some
have suggested that it is significant that John, and only John among the
New Testament documents, provides a description of Jesus accomplishing all
three of these things. Of these, at least the expectation of a new provision
of manna in connection with the coming of the Messiah can be dated with some
certainty to the time of John.
 The discussion which follows
may thus also be an attempt to show that Jesus fulfils this Jewish expectation,
albeit not in the way that most Jews expected.
<P>
vv32-33) It was Borgen who first championed the idea that the words attributed
to Jesus here are in fact proposing an alternative rendering of the OT text
under discussion. In his
work, reference is made to the exegetical technique which occurs with some
frequency in the rabbinic and other early Jewish literature, where a phrase
like 'do not read X, but Y' proposes an alternative understanding of the
passage in question. In this instance, the suggestion is that the Hebrew
consonants <I>ntn</I> are being read with a different pointing, so that the
word is understood to be 'he gives' rather than 'he gave'. Then a further
interpretative suggestion is made, namely that the 'he' in question is not
Moses, but God. Although the exact phrase from the rabbinic literature is
not reproduced, it nonetheless seems very likely that what we have here is
still to be regarded as the proposal of an alternative understanding of the
Old Testament quotation/paraphrase which will form the subject of the rest
of the discussion.
<P>
The 'bread of God' is then interpreted as a reference to 'he who (or 'that
which') comes down from heaven and gives life to the world'. Although it
has been suggested that the bread from heaven was identified with Moses in
at least one strand of ancient Jewish
thought, there is no evidence
that such ideas stem from the time when the Fourth Gospel was written or
earlier, and it would thus be unwise to rest our interpretation of this motif
on such later traditions. However, in the Old Testament already and throughout
the later Wisdom literature, the manna or bread from heaven is frequently
identified with the Word or Wisdom of God. God's Wisdom or Word was
also identified with Torah, which by association meant that the manna also
became a symbol of Torah. Thus here the Johannine Jesus is making the assertion,
not infrequent in Judaism, that the true bread from heaven is the Wisdom
or Word of God which comes down from heaven to give life to human beings.
The implications of this in the context of Johannine Christology will soon
become apparent.
<P>
v34) The crowd requests that they be given this bread 'from now on', suggesting
a literal, material understanding of Jesus' words is in their minds, one
which will soon be challenged.
<P>
v35) In this verse a key turning point occurs in the discussion, in the form
of an 'I am' declaration by Jesus, which will determine the course of the
remainder of the chapter's discourse. Jesus here identifies himself as the
bread from heaven. This saying is a revelation of the significance of Jesus
for salvation in metaphorical language, as are all the 'I am'
sayings. Jesus is the true
embodiment of God's Wisdom, and the source of true spiritual nourishment
which gives eternal life.
<P>
vv36-40) Jesus' words continue with an accusation of the Jews' unwillingness
to believe. The mention of the Father in this context is significant. The
Father of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel is clearly identical to the God of the
Jewish Scriptures. Many
commentators have seen here a predestinarian emphasis, which is of course quite
common in sectarian Jewish literature and is in many ways a quite natural
reading of the text. However, a rather different emphasis is likely to provide
a better understanding of this portion of John 6. At a number of significant
junctures in the conflict between Jesus and 'the Jews' presented in John,
Jesus rebukes the Jews by saying that if they had known the Father, whom
they claim as their God, they would have known and accepted Jesus. This knowledge of God
refers at least primarily to a correct response to the message of the Jewish
Scriptures. It would thus seem fair to read this passage as conveying a similar
message to those which assert that if the Jews had correctly understood the
witness of Moses, they would have come to Jesus: likewise, had the Jews responded
in the correct way to the Father in his previous interactions with the Jewish
people, including especially, but not necessarily exclusively, the Jewish
Scriptures, they would have come to Jesus. The key message of the passage
is thus not predestinarian, but apologetic and polemical: the Jews reject
Jesus because they have rejected their own God. This interpretation fits
in well not only with the overall tenor of the Fourth Gospel, but also, as
we shall soon see, with the specific emphases of this chapter.
<P>
Before proceeding, we should also mention the possibility, in light of the
similar phrase in John 9:34, that Jesus is presented in v37 in sharp contrast
to the Jewish leaders: they drove Jesus' followers out of the synagogue,
but those who come to Jesus will never have to experience the alienation
of being driven out from his community.
<P>
v41-42) The specific wording of John's account here of the response of the
Jews to Jesus' words is extremely significant. To a reader who has already
detected the explicit and implicit references to the provision of the manna
in the wilderness as recounted in the Old Testament, the word 'grumble' would
provide an immediate intertextual echo of these stories. The author uses
the same verb, <I>gonguzw_</I>, which appears in the LXX of
Exod.16:7-9. This parallel
is noted by most commentators, but only Barrett, Carson
and Hanson make explicit mention of the important connection that the author
is seeking to make between the contemporaries of Jesus and the Israelites
in the wilderness. Carson writes, "Their grumbling shows them to be of the
same spirit as that displayed by their fathers in the wilderness who complained
before (Ex.16:2, 8-9) and after (Nu.11:4ff.) the manna was provided". And as Hanson comments,
"John would surely have seen a deep significance in Exod.16.7: the Jews of
old were really murmuring against God. In murmuring against Jesus the Jews
are unwittingly doing the same thing". That the author intends
the reader to compare these two generations of Israelites seems unmistakeable,
and the significance of this would appear once again to be illuminated by
an apologetic reading. It is frequent for apologetic works to point to the
behaviour of a group in the past as part of an accusation of present wrongdoing. In this instance, the
Jewish leaders pointed to the fact that the majority of the Jews and their
leaders had not accepted Jesus as an evidence that he was not in fact the
Messiah or one sent by God, and the Fourth Evangelist
responds by alluding to the teaching of the Jewish Scriptures that Israel
has also in the past refused to accept the one whom God sent to them, and
then as now, 'grumbled' at the bread from heaven which he provided. This
functions both as a challenge to the Jewish objects of evangelists from the
Johannine community, and as a legitimating reassurance in light of the failure
of so many Jews to believe in Jesus.
<P>
The issue which is presented as causing the Jews to grumble here is the claim
of Jesus to be the bread that came down from heaven. The heart of their problem
is made clear in v42: Jesus' audience know that Jesus is a human being,
apparently like other human beings, and his family is known to them, and
these facts make his claim to a heavenly origin seem ludicrous. This provides
evidence for what was at any rate extremely likely, namely that the development
of the doctrine of Jesus' pre-existence caused difficulties for the Jews
(and even for many Christians, as we shall soon see). On the one hand, the
identification of Jesus with Wisdom, and as the Son of Man who had existed
in heaven prior to his appearance on earth, was not a particularly radical
development in the context of Judaism and Jewish Christianity: the language
of pre-existence had been applied to a number of Old Testament figures, and
some had also been said to have been indwelt by the Spirit and/or Wisdom
of God. However, on the other hand it appears that, whereas to make such
claims for heroic figures of scripture was one thing, to make such claims
about a human being who had lived in the recent past and who was well known
was much more difficult to accept.
<P>
vv43-44) Jesus rebukes his Jewish interlocutors for their grumbling, what
follows is again widely read as a predestinarian assertion. We have already
mentioned that such statements are common in Jewish sectarian literature,
most notably the Dead Sea Scrolls, as an explanation of why the majority
of Jews have rejected the minority's message. Yet in the case of the present
passage, we have suggested another reading which seems to better fit within
the emphasis of the passage, and indeed of the Gospel as a whole. Jesus'
words here, that no one can come to him unless drawn by the Father, functions
in a way similar to Exod.16:8, where Moses rebukes the Israelites by saying,
"You are not grumbling against us, but against the Lord". To complain against
God's servant or appointed messenger is to grumble against
God, and here these words
of Jesus serve as a reprimand against the Jews: if they do not come to Jesus,
there must be something wrong with their relationship with or attitude to
God.
<P>
v45) That our reading of v44 is correct is confirmed in v45: those who are
willing to listen to and learn from the Father, again presumably via the
Old Testament revelation, will come to Jesus. These verses are more a reminder
to the Jews of their responsibility than a statement of predestinarianism.
The verse which Jesus paraphrases from Isa.54:13 provokes numerous intertextual
echoes. Firstly, this verse comes in the context of a description of the
restored state of Israel after she will be brought back from exile. There
is much evidence that many if not most Israelites thought of the exilic state
as something continuing into their own time, and which would be brought to
a climactic end at the end of the
age. This verse would thus
conjure up in the mind of those familiar with its context both a sense that
Jesus is claiming to fulfil at least one element of the promise of Israel's
restoration, and also perhaps would recall Israel's present state and the
danger which looms over Israel when she is disobedient. The former claim
is to the fore, being made much more explicitly, but both of these points
would be important ones in the context of a christological debate with the
Jews.
<P>
Secondly, this text occurs very near to Isa.55:1-11, in which God, speaking
much as Wisdom does elsewhere in the OT, offers food and drink to Israel.
This passage appears to be in the Fourth Evangelist's mind throughout this
chapter. The reference to concern for food which does not satisfy (Isa.55:2)
is quite close to John 6:27, and the descent and return of the word to accomplish
God's purpose in Isa.55:10f is also very close to the Johannine discussion
of Jesus as the true bread from heaven, especially since, as we have already
noted, there was already a long-standing and widespread tradition that the
manna in some sense represented the word of God. This allusion to a neighbouring
passage should help the reader to understand that the identification of Jesus
as the bread from heaven is really about the identification of him as God's
life-giving word.
<P>
v46) An assertion is made here which is very much reminiscent of John 1:18.
Here as there, there is probably an attempt to both uphold the strong Jewish
tradition that no one has ever seen God, while acknowledging at the same
time that in some sense knowledge of God is possible through the mediation
of God's Word, Wisdom or Shekinah. The distinctive element is that this figure
is now identified with the human figure of Jesus, so that he becomes the
exclusive locus of revelation. It is implied that any claims which the Jews
may make to know God in isolation from faith in Jesus are invalid.
<P>
vv47-51) In this section, the key focus is on receiving eternal life, which
is said to be possible by believing (v47), by eating the bread from heaven
(v50), and by Jesus giving his flesh for the life of the world (v51). In
the last of these verses, the reference to Jesus giving his flesh alludes
to his death, and very probably also to the Christian Eucharist. This, however,
still leaves open the question of the <I>significance</I> of the allusion:
it is one thing to say that language reminiscent of the Lord's Supper is
present, but quite another to say this language is being used to teach, for
instance, that participation in the sacrament is in and of itself life giving.
It would seem preferable to suggest that all of these statements are parallel,
and represent different aspects of the same thing: to believe in Jesus includes
believing in his words, in his status as God's agent and Word, and in his
death as a saving event. Believing in Jesus also implies joining the Christian
community, and thus sharing in its sacraments, and in particular in its table
fellowship. Meals in the ancient world were of great importance, and were
thus open to becoming the bearers of symbolic significance, and this was
clearly true in early Christianity, where in the Pauline communities, for
example, the unity of believers with Christ and with each other was considered
to be symbolized in the table fellowship of Christians when they met together
for the Lord's Supper. Given the fact that all other references to Jesus
providing food or water in this Gospel are clearly intended to convey a symbolic
or spiritual meaning, which is mistakenly overlooked in favour of a more
earthly understanding by Jesus' interlocutors, a similar interpretation should
be given here.
<P>
It may also be proposed that, if the Jews with whom the Johannine Christians
were debating expected the messiah to provide literal manna as Moses had
done, then Jesus here is
presented as challenging that expectation. Jesus himself is the true manna,
which gives eternal life. This is important in the context we have proposed.
Firstly, by identifying Jesus himself as the manna, a response is given to
Jewish objectors who refuse to believe in Jesus because he did not provide
manna: Jesus himself is the manna God provides. Secondly, the manna provided
in Jesus is superior to that which the Jews expected: the manna provided
in Moses' time did not give eternal life, whereas Jesus does. This contrast
would thus have served an important legitimating function for the Johannine
Christians: the Jews expect manna, but the Johannine Christians have the
<I>real</I> manna, which gives eternal life. The importance of this point
is brought out by the fact that it is returned to as a conclusion of the
discourse in v58.
<P>
v52) As Lindars points
out, most manuscripts omit
'his' here, and this is very likely to be original, both because of the fact
that 'his' would be a natural addition to make, and also because the reading
thus preserved would provide a further reminiscence of the Jews' response
to Moses in Exodus 16, where they grumble and argue and demand <I>flesh to
eat</I>. Lindars, however, makes too much of this, concluding that what is
at issue is how Jesus can provide yet another supply of food, whereas the
context makes clear that, in spite of this allusion, the issue must still
be Jesus' words about giving his flesh. The point is that the response of
the Jews to Jesus' words is one of stubbornness, like the response of the
Israelites to Moses even after they had seen God's miraculous provision,
and that the provision of miraculous food or drink should in both cases result
in a provisional faith which is open to respond to God's servant.
<P>
vv53-58) This final section, while a response to the Jewish objections to
his reference to his flesh as the true bread from heaven which they must
eat, is still a continuation of the christological exposition of the Exodus
paraphrase cited at the outset of the discussion. Here the focus comes on
to the final words, 'to eat', and their interpretation in light of the
identification of Jesus as God's Wisdom and Word, and thus as the 'bread
of life', the bread from heaven. It is thus necessary to follow Borgen in
regarding this section as an essential part of the
discourse, and to reject
Brown's contention that this section is independent of what proceeds it in
both imagery and meaning. However, while we may
disagree with his conclusion that in this section the Eucharist has become
the exclusive theme, Brown may be correct in considering that eucharistic
imagery, which has played a minor role in the discourse thus far, now takes
on a dominant role. The
references to blood as well as flesh cannot derive from the manna traditions,
and thus its most likely origin is in the Christian eucharistic tradition.
As Beasley-Murray, a commentator without any particular pro-sacramentarian
bias, writes, "it is evident that neither the Evangelist nor the Christian
readers could have written or read the saying without conscious reference
to the eucharist". However,
it is still necessary to beware of reading later developments back into the
Fourth Gospel, and of assuming that later views derived from this text
necessarily provide the best interpretation of it.
<P>
The best way forward, in light of the conclusions we have reached thus far,
is perhaps to turn immediately to the question of what these words are likely
to have signified in the context of the debates between the Johannine Christians
and the Jewish synagogue. Here, as elsewhere, a sociological reading provides
an important insight. D. Rensberger has suggested in connection with John
3 that, in the context of such a debate, the call to be 'born again of water
and Spirit' would have been understood as a call to join the Johannine community,
and in so doing to share in its initiation processes, sacraments and overall
religious experience. Such a reading appears to be even more appropriate
in the present instance. For the Jewish reader, to believe in Jesus would mean to join the Christian
group, and to face ridicule and exclusion from the Jewish community. One
of the many elements of the belief and practice of the Johannine Christians
which the non-Christian Jews found unacceptable was undoubtably the language
used in the Christian celebration of the Lord's Supper. Sharing in this Christian
sacrament was therefore
an important element of Christian belief for those undergoing conversion,
because it represented a move from table fellowship as part of the Jewish
community to exclusion from that community in exchange for fellowship with
Jesus and his followers. Sharing in the flesh and blood of Jesus by becoming
part of the community that believes in him, it is emphasized, is also sharing
in the true bread from heaven, which the Jews claim to wait for, but which,
in rejecting Jesus, they reject and exclude themselves from. The main point
of the combination of Christian sacramental and Old testament manna imagery
here is to present a counter-identity which will legitimate the Christians'
beliefs and practices in the context of their debates with the synagogue.
<P>
v59) This comment, whatever its historical basis, is important as an indicator
that our approach to this chapter as primarily concerned with the exegesis
of the Jewish Scriptures is correct. To the Fourth Evangelist at least, and
presumably also to his readers, this discourse represented the sort of 'sermon'
one expected to hear in a synagogue
context.
<P>
v60) In this verse we have a response to Jesus' words which is quite unusual
in John, inasmuch as here
we find <I>disciples</I> of Jesus who find Jesus' words unacceptable. This
suggests that the issues presented in this discourse were controversial not
only for Jews outside the Christian circle, but for Christians as well.
<P>
vv61-65) The description of Jesus' disciples as <I>grumbling</I> strengthens
the indication that here some of Jesus' own followers are presented as responding
to Jesus in the way that the Israelites had responded to Moses after the
Exodus. Not only those Jews who had rejected the Johannine Christians, but
even some of their own group were unhappy with this teaching. It is likely
that they were responding to developments in the Johannine community's beliefs
and practices, and it is essential for our purposes that we see clearly what
those developments are likely to have been. This chapter suggests a number
of possible issues, none of them mutually exclusive: the identification of
Jesus with the manna, and also with Wisdom; the concept of his pre-existence;
the idea of Jesus' death as a saving event; and the Christian eucharistic
practice, or at least the emphasis placed upon it by the Johannine Christians
even in light of the offence it caused to most Jews. In relation to the last
item mentioned, it cannot be ruled out <I>a priori</I> that we have here
evidence of what has been called a more sacramentarian approach to the Lord's
Supper, with it being understood as a literal eating of Jesus' flesh and
drinking of his blood, a development which many Christians are thus shown
to have found unacceptable. However, in light of Jesus' words about spirit
and flesh in v63, it seems far more likely that a literal understanding of
Jesus' words about eating his flesh and drinking his blood was a
<I>mistaken</I> understanding, resulting from an inability to grasp the deeper,
spiritual significance of Jesus' words.
<P>
Jesus responds to the offence of these disciples with a reference to the
ascent of the Son of Man. Barrett discusses the possible
meanings, and concludes
that the two main alternatives usually proposed, that the ascent of the Son
of Man will either remove the stumbling block or will actually increase the
offence of Jesus, are not mutually exclusive, and thus that both contain
an element of the truth. To the unbeliever, the ascent of the Son of Man
will prove to be the ultimate stumbling block, whereas to the believer, it
will provide the ultimate confirmation of Jesus' words and identity.
<P>
In the context of the development of Johannine christology, there are good
reasons for believing that the identification of Jesus with Wisdom arose
out of a need to justify the exalted place attributed to Jesus after his
ascension, and that the emphasis on Jesus' pre-existence also relates to
the need to present him as one who is more qualified than Moses to reveal
heavenly things. It is striking
that both these motifs are present here: throughout the discourse, a contrast
with Moses/Torah can be detected, and here now the ascension is emphasized
as a return of Jesus to where he was before. The point of the present section
appears to be that the ascension will prove to be an unbearable stumbling
block to the Jews, but only because they, in contrast to the Johannine
Christians, have failed to discern in Jesus the presence of God's Word or
Wisdom.
<P>
Jesus then goes on to clarify that it is the Spirit which is important and
life-giving; the flesh counts for nothing. This is clearly a decisive indicator
against a reading of the preceding discourse which treats any of the ideas
found there too literally. Jesus' heavenly origins are <I>spiritual</I>.
He is not presented as having descended from heaven as a fully-formed
flesh-and-blood being, but his 'spiritual origins', the origins of the one
who is incarnate in or as Jesus, are spiritual. The eating of Jesus' flesh
and blood also has a spiritual meaning, although the exact details of that
meaning are less important to us than the overall significance which the
presentation of Jesus along these lines would have had in the context of
the Johannine conflict with the synagogue. In the Fourth Gospel, Jesus' words
are always enigmatic and difficult. Those who have faith, who already have
responded to some extent to the Father, will probe deeper and come to Jesus,
whereas those who refuse to believe will stumble over the literal meaning
of Jesus' words and fail to discern the deeper spiritual meaning in them.
<P>
v66) The result of the teaching presented in this chapter is that many of
Jesus' disciples turn back from following him. We are probably meant to see
here a shrinking of the Johannine Christian group as a result of the conflict
and the subsequent developments in belief in practice.
<P>
v67-71) In contrast to those who turn back, the Twelve, mentioned here for
the first time in John, are presented as discerning that Jesus has the words
of eternal life, and that he is the holy one of God. The Twelve represent
the correct attitude of faith, and are thus intended as a challenge to wavering
Christians. A further warning is provided in the final words of this chapter,
in the mention of Judas Iscariot, who is presumably mentioned as a reminder
that even one of the Twelve could turn out to be 'a devil' if he did not
believe. This warning, which concludes the discourse on a somber note, indicates
the tensions which existed in the community's conflict setting and the
community's concern to legitimate itself and its beliefs in the face of the
loss of a number of members.
<H2>
  <FONT COLOR="#1c1aff">Conclusion: John 6:25-71 in Johannine Legitimation</FONT>
</H2>
<P>
We have found in this chapter's 'Bread of Life' discourse a number of features
which suggest that it had an important role to play in the legitimation of
the Johannine community's beliefs and practices. Central to the discourse
are motifs which were important to the Johannine Christians in their debates
and conflicts with the synagogue: Jesus' fulfilment of messianic expectations
(specifically, the provision of manna), his heavenly origin, his ascension,
his relationship to Moses/Torah. We also found present here references and
allusions to the 'sacraments' of the Johannine community, and a challenge
to Jewish interlocutors to overcome initial stumbling blocks and to find
faith in Jesus as part of the Johannine group of Christians.
<P>
In this chapter, Jesus is identified as the true manna or bread from heaven.
The origin of this concept is probably the need to show that Jesus fulfilled
the Jewish expectation of an eschatological provision of manna, coupled with
the developing Wisdom christology formulated from the need to contrast Jesus
with Moses and/or Torah. Although eucharistic language and imagery does play an important part in
this chapter, we have not found the eucharist to be its central focus. Rather,
the bread of life discourse represents a christological exposition of the
Old Testament manna tradition. Eucharistic language is thus probably used
not as an end in itself, but because it enables faith in Jesus to be expounded
in a way that is relevant to the Johannine community's legitimation of its
beliefs and practices in the context of its conflict with the synagogue.
<P>
In the mind of the Johannine Christians, the ascent of Jesus simply confirmed
that Jesus was in fact the pre-existent Son of Man, and the incarnation of
God's Word/Wisdom. Yet the reaction of many Christians as well as Jews shows
that they were aware that developments were taking place, and that some
considered these developments unacceptable. Together, these features which
we have found in John 6 appear to provide support for our suggestion that
the distinctive developments in Johannine Christology were formed in the
furnace of the community's conflict with the synagogue.
