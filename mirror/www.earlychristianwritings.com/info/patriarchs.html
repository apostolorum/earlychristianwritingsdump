<P>
INTRODUCTORY NOTICE TO THE 
TESTAMENTS OF THE TWELVE PATRIARCHS
<P>This very curious fragment of antiquity deserves a few words in anticipation 
of the translator's valuable preface. Grabe's <I>Spicilegium</I> is there 
referred to; but it may be well also to consult his citations, in elucidation, 
of Bull's <I>Defensio Fidei Nicaenae</I>, 
where he treats the work with respect. My most valued authority, however, on 
this subject, is Lardner, 
who gives a very full account of the work with his usual candor and learning. He 
seems to treat the matter with a needless profusion of space and consideration; 
yet in a much later volume of his great treatise he recurs to the subject 
with expressions of satisfaction that he had dealt with it so largely 
before.</P>
<P>Cave placed the composition of the Testaments about a.d.192, but concedes a 
much earlier origin to the first portion of the work. Origen quotes from it, and 
Tertullian is supposed to have borrowed from it one of his expositions, as will 
be noted in its place. Lardner clears it from charges of Ebionitism, 
but thinks the author was so far in accord with that heresy as to use 
expressions savouring of "Unitarianism." Of this charge he is not justly 
susceptible, it appears to me: quite otherwise. If we can imagine Trypho coming 
to the light after his kindly parting with Justin, 
I can conceive of such a man as the author of this work. He is a Christian 
awakening to the real purport of the Old-Testament Scriptures, and anxious to 
lead rather than drive his brethren after the flesh to the discovery of Him 
"concerning whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write: "not a "Judaizing 
Christian," as Cave imagined, but the reverse,-a Christianizing Jew. Now, I must 
think that such a writer would weave into his plan many accepted traditions of 
the Jews and many Rabbinical expositions of the sacred writers. He was doubtless 
acquainted with that remarkable passage in the Revelation in which the 
patriarchs are so honourably named, 
and with that corresponding passage which seems to unite the twelve patriarchs 
with the twelve apostles.
St. Paul's claim for the twelve tribes before Agrippa 
would naturally impress itself on such a mind. Whether the product of such a 
character with such a disposition would naturally be such an affectionate and 
filial attempt as this to identify the religion of the Crucified with the faith 
of the Jewish fathers,
may be judged of by my reader. </P>
<P>It appears to me an ill-advised romance; not more a "pious fraud" than 
several fictions which have attracted attention in our own times, based on the 
traditions of the Hebrews. The legends of the "Wandering Jew" have grown out of 
corresponding instincts among Christians. To me they appear like the profane 
"Passion-plays" lately revived among Christians,-a most unwarrantable form of 
teaching even truth. But as to the work itself, seeing it exists, I must 
acknowledge that it seems to me a valuable relic of antiquity, and an 
interesting specimen of the feelings and convictions of those believers over 
whom St. James presided in Jerusalem: 
"Israelites indeed," but "zealous of the law." They were now convinced that 
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, with Moses and all the prophets, looked for the 
Messiah who had appeared in Jesus of Nazareth. The author of this book was 
anxious to show that the twelve patriarchs were twelve believers in the Paschal 
Lamb, and that they died in Christian penitence and faith.</P>
<P>He, then, who will read or study the following waif of the olden time, as I 
have done, will not find it unprofitable reading. It really supplies a key to 
some difficulties in the Scripture narrative. It suggests what are at least 
plausible counterparts of what is written. "To the pure all things are pure; 
"and I see nothing that need defile in any of the details which expose the sins, 
and magnify the penitence, of the patriarchs. In fact, Lardner's objection to 
one of the sections in the beautiful narrative of Joseph strikes me as 
extraordinary. It is the story of a heroic conflict with temptation, the like of 
which was doubtless not uncommon in the days of early Christians living among 
heathens; 
and I think it was possibly written to inspire a Joseph-like chastity in 
Christian youth. "I do not suppose," says Lardner, "that the virtue of any of 
these ancient Hebrews was complete according to the Christian rule." I am amazed 
at this; I have always supposed the example of Joseph the more glorious because 
he flourished as the flower of chastity in a gross and carnal age. Who so pure 
as he save John the Baptist, that morning star that shone so near the Sun of 
Righteousness in the transient beauty of his "heliacal rising"? Surely Joseph 
was a type of Christ in this as in other particulars, and our author merely 
enables us to understand the "fiery darts" which he was wont to hurl back at the 
tempter. I own (reluctantly, because I dislike this form of teaching) that for 
me the superlative ode of the dying Jacob receives a reflected lustre from this 
curious book, especially in the splendid eulogy with which the old patriarch 
blesses his beloved Joseph. "The author," says Lardner, "in an indirect manner 
...bears a large testimony to the Christian religion, to the facts, principles, 
and books of the New Testament. He speaks of the nativity of Christ, the 
meekness and unblameableness of His life, His crucifixion at the instigation of 
the Jewish priests, the wonderful concomitants of His death, His resurrection, 
and ascension. He represents the character of the Messiah as God and man: the 
Most High God with men, eating and drinking with them; the Son of God; the 
Saviour of the world, of the Gentiles and Israel; as Eternal High Priest and 
King. He likewise speaks of the effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the Messiah, 
attended with a voice from heaven; His unrighteous treatment by the Jews; their 
desolations and the destruction of the Temple upon that account; the call of the 
Gentiles; the illuminating them generally with new light; the effusion of the 
Spirit upon believers, but especially, and in a more abundant measure, upon the 
Gentiles.... There are allusions to the Gospels of St. Matthew, St. Luke and St. 
John, the Acts of the Apostles, and of the Epistles to Ephesians, First 
Thessalonians, First Timothy, Hebrews, and First St. John, also to the 
Revelation. So far as consistent with the assumed character of his work, the 
author declares the canonical authority of the Acts of the Apostles and the 
Epistles of St. Paul." Of which of the minor writers among the Ante-Nicene 
Fathers can so much be said?</P>
<P>Regarded as a sort of Jewish surrender to Justin's argument with Trypho, this 
book is interesting, and represents, no doubt, the convictions of thousands of 
Jewish converts of the first age. It is, in short, worthy of more attention than 
it has yet received. </P>
<P>Here follows Mr. Sinker's valuable Introductory Notice: -</P>
<P>The apocryphal work known as the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs 
professes to be, as its name implies, the utterances of the dying patriarchs, 
the sons of Jacob. In these they give some account of their lives, embodying 
particulars not found in the scriptural account, and build thereupon various 
moral precepts for the guidance of their descendants. The book partakes also of 
the nature of an Apocalypse: the patriarchs see in the future their children 
doing wickedly, stained with the sins of every nation; and thus they foretell 
the troubles impending on their race. Still at last God will put an end to their 
woe, and comfort is found in the promise of a Messiah</P>
<P>There can be little or no doubt that the author was a Jew, who, having been 
converted to Christianity, sought to win over his countrymen to the same faith, 
and thus employed the names of the patriarchs as a vehicle for conveying 
instruction to their descendants, as winning by this means for his teaching at 
any rate a <I>prima facie</I> welcome in the eyes of the Jewish people.</P>
<P>It does not seem hard to settle approximately the limits of time within which 
the book was probably written. It cannot be placed very late in the second 
century, seeing that it is almost certainly quoted by Tertullian, 
and that Origen
cites the Testaments by name, apparently indeed holding it in considerable 
respect. We can, however, approximate much more nearly than this; for the 
allusions to the destruction of Jerusalem assign to the Testaments a date 
subsequent to that event. This will harmonize perfectly with what is the natural 
inference from several passages,-namely, that the Gentiles now were a majority 
in the Church,-as well as with the presence of the many formulae to express the 
incarnation, and with the apparent collection of the books of the New Testament 
into a volume. 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, important evidence as to the posterior limit of the date 
of writing may be derived from the language used with reference to the 
priesthood. Christ is both High Priest and King, and His former office is higher 
than the latter, and to Him the old priesthood must resign its rights. Now such 
language as this would be almost meaningless after Hadrian's destruction of 
Jerusalem consequent on the revolt of Bar-Cochba (a.d. 135), after which all 
power of Judaism for acting directly upon Christianity ceased; and, indeed, on 
the hypothesis of a later date, we should doubtless find allusions to the revolt 
and its suppression. On the above grounds, we infer that the writing of the 
Testaments is to be placed in a period ranging from late in the first century to 
the revolt of Bar-Cochba; closer than this it is perhaps not safe to draw our 
limits. 
</P>
<P>The language in which the Testaments were written was no doubt the 
Hellenistic Greek in which we now possess them; presenting as they do none of 
the peculiar marks which characterize a version. Whether there were a Hebrew 
work on which the present was modelled-a supposition by no means improbable in 
itself-we cannot tell, nor is it a matter of much importance. The phenomena of 
the book itself may be cited in support of this conclusion: for instance, the 
use of the word <FONT face=SPIonic>diaqh/kn</FONT> in its ordinary classical 
meaning of "testament," not "covenant" as in Hellenistic Greek, for which former 
meaning there would be no strictly equivalent word in Hebrew; the numerous 
instances of paronomasia, such as <FONT face=SPIonic>a0etei=n, 
nouqetei=n,</FONT> 
<FONT face=SPIonic>a0fai/resij, a0nai/resij,</FONT> 
<FONT face=SPIonic>limo/j, loimo/j,</FONT>
<FONT face=SPIonic>e0n ta/cei, a@takton,</FONT>
<FONT face=SPIonic>ta/cij, a0taci/a\</FONT> 
the frequent use of the genitive absolute, and of the verb <FONT 
face=SPIonic>me/llein</FONT>; the use of various expressions pertaining to the 
Greek philosophy, as <FONT face=SPIonic>dia/qesij, ai!sqhsij, fu/sij, 
te/loj</FONT>.</P>
<P>It seems doubtful how far we can attempt with safety to determine accurately 
the religious standpoint of the writer beyond the obvious fact of his Jewish 
origin, though some have attempted to show that he was a Nazarene, and others a 
Jewish Christian of Pauline tendencies. We shall therefore content ourselves 
with referring those who seek for more specific information on this point to the 
works mentioned below.</P>
<P>To refer now briefly to the external history of our document, we meet with 
nothing definite, after its citation by Origen, for many centuries: there are 
possible allusions in Jerome
and in Procopius Gazaeus;
there is also a mention of <FONT face=SPIonic>patria/rxai</FONT> in the 
<I>Synopsis Sacrae Scripturae</I> found among the writings of Athanasius, as 
well as in the <I>Stichometria</I> of Nicephorus of Constantinople, on which it 
is probably based. Again, in the Canons of the Council of Rome (494 a.d.) under 
Gelasius, and of the Council of Bracara (563 a.d.), are possible references, 
though it is far from improbable that in some of the foregoing passages the 
reference may be to a writing <FONT face=SPIonic>tw=n triw=n Patriarxw=n</FONT> 
alluded to in the Apostolic Constitutions,
or is even of somewhat loose application.</P>
<P>After this a blank ensues until the middle of the thirteenth century, when it 
was brought to the knowledge of Western Europe by Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of 
Lincoln, the earliest of the great English reformers.
We cite here the account of the matter given by Matthew Paris, although of 
course we need not accept all the opinions of the old chronicler respecting the 
document in question: "At this same time, Robert, Bishop of Lincoln, a man most 
deeply versed in Latin and Greek, accurately translated the Testaments of the 
XII. Patriarchs from Greek into Latin. These had been for a long time unknown 
and hidden through the jealousy of the Jews, on account of the prophecies of the 
Saviour contained in them. The Greeks, however, the most unwearied investigators 
of all writings, were the first to come to a knowledge of this document, and 
translated it from Hebrew into Greek, and have kept it to themselves till our 
times. And neither in the time of the blessed Jerome nor of any other holy 
interpreter could the Christians gain an acquaintance with it, through the 
malice of the ancient Jews. This glorious treatise, then, the aforesaid bishop 
(with the help of Master Nicolaus, a Greek, and a clerk of the Abbey of St. 
Alban's) translated fully and clearly, and word for word, from Greek into Latin, 
to the strengthening of the Christian faith, and to the greater confusion of the 
Jews."
</P>
<P>Again, after speaking of the death of "Master John de Basingstokes, 
Archdeacon of Leicester," a man of very great learning in Latin and Greek, he 
proceeds : 
"This Master John had mentioned to Robert, Bishop of Lincoln, that when he was 
studying at Athens he had seen and heard from learned Greek doctors certain 
things unknown to the Latins. Among these he found the Testaments of the XII. 
Patriarchs, that is to say, of the sons of Jacob. Now it is plain that these 
really form part of the sacred volume, but have been long hidden through the 
jealousy of the Jews, on account of the evident prophecies about Christ which 
are clearly seen in them. Consequently this same bishop sent into Greece; and 
when he obtained them, he translated them from Greek into Latin, as well as 
certain other things."</P>
<P>After this it would seem as though the same fate still pursued our document, 
for the entire Greek text was not printed until the eve of the eighteenth 
century, when it was published for the first time by Grabe, whose edition has 
been several times reprinted.
</P>
<P>Four Greek mss. of the Testaments are known to exist:-</P>
<P>I. The ms.ff. i. 24 in the University Library of Cambridge, to which it was 
given by Archbishop Parker, whose autograph it bears on its first page. It is a 
quarto on parchment, of 261 leaves (in which the Testaments occupy ff. 
203<I>a</I>-261<I>b</I>), double columns, 20 lines in a column, handwriting of 
the tenth century. It is furnished with accents and breathings, and a fairly 
full punctuation. There are very strong grounds for believing that it was this 
ms. that Grossetestes version was made, exhibiting as it does a very large 
amount of curious verbal coincidence with it. 
The text of this ms.has been that given in the various editions mentioned 
below.</P>
<P>2. The ms. Barocci 133 in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, where it came with 
the rest of the Barocci collection from Venice, and was presented to the 
University by its Chancellor, the Earl of Pembroke. It is a quarto volume; and 
except a leaf or two of parchment, containing writing of an older period, 
consists of a number of treatises on paper, apparently by several different 
hands, in the writing of the latter part of the fourteenth century. The 
Testaments occupy ff. 179<I>a</I>-203<I>b</I>. The amount of difference between 
this ms. and the preceding is considerable, and is sufficient to show that it 
has had no direct communication with the latter. A large number of omissions 
occur in it, in some instances amounting to entire chapters. The variations of 
this ms. are given more or less fully in the various editions.</P>
<P>3. A ms. in the Vatican Library at Rome, not yet edited. It is said to be a 
small quarto on paper, written in a very distinct hand, though unfortunately 
some leaves are damaged. It bears a subscription with the date 1235. I owe my 
knowledge of this ms. to an article by Dr. Vorstman in the <I>Godgeleerde 
Bijdragen</I> for 1866, p. 953 sqq.</P>
<P>4. A ms. discovered by Tischendorf in the island of Patmos, of which no 
details have yet been published. 
</P>
<P>The entire Greek text of the Testaments was first printed by Grabe in his 
<I>Spicilegium Patrum et Haereticorum</I>, Oxford, 1698, professedly from the 
Cambridge ms., but in reality from some very inaccurate transcript of it, very 
possibly from one made by Abednego Seller, also in the Cambridge University 
Library, Oo. vi. 92. Grabe also gave a few of the variations of the Oxford ms. 
Fabricius, in his <I>Codex Pseudepigraphus Veteris Testamenti</I>,
gives little more than a reprint from Grabe. In the second edition of the latter 
(1714) the true text has been restored in several passages; but in many places 
Grosseteste's Latin version, which witnessed to the true reading, was altered to 
suit Grabe's incorrect text. Fabricius' second edition (1722) is perhaps, on the 
whole, less accurate than his first. Since then the text and notes, as given in 
Grabe's second edition, have been reprinted, with but few additions, by 
Gallandi, in his <I>Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum</I>, vol. i. p. 193 sqq., Venice, 
1765, and in Migne's <I>Patrologia Graeca</I>, vol. ii., Paris, 1857. The text 
of the Cambridge ms. with a full statement of the variations of the Oxford ms., 
has recently been edited directly from the mss. by myself, Cambridge, 1869; from 
this edition the present translation has been made.</P>
<P>The mss. of Grosseteste's Latin version are numerous, there being no less 
than twelve in Cambridge alone and it has been frequently printed, both with the 
editions of the Greek text and independently. 
</P>
<P>Besides the Latin version, the Testaments have also been translated into 
several European languages, in all cases apparently from the Latin. The English 
translation made by Arthur Golding was first printed by John Daye in Aldersgate 
in 1581, and has since been frequently reproduced; the British Museum, which 
does not possess all the editions, having no less than eleven.
</P>
<P>The author of the French translation
appears to believe, as the English translator had done, that we have here really 
the last words of the sons of Jacob. A German translation has also several times 
been published,
and a German translation in ms. is to be found in the British Museum.
We may further mention a Dutch translation (Antwerp, 1570), a Danish translation 
(1601), and a ms. Icelandic translation of the eighteenth century in the British 
Museum, add. mss 11, 068.</P>
