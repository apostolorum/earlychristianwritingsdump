<DIV id=iii.xx.iii title="Teaching of the Twelve Apostles">
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1>"<B>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.</B>" Bryennius 
discovered at Constantinople a MS. thus entitled in a vol. containing an 
unmutilated MS. text of the two Epp. ascribed to Clement, and pub. it at the 
close of 1883, no other copy being known to exist in MS. or print.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.1>The MS. bears the heading "Teaching of the Twelve 
Apostles," followed by the fuller title "Teaching of the Lord by the Twelve 
Apostles to the Gentiles." That both titles belong to the original form appears 
probable from the phrase "the Twelve Apostles." The phrase <FONT 
face=symbol>didach tvn apostolwn</FONT> occurs in <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Acts+2:42," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.2>Acts ii. 42</A>; and the earliest writers who have been 
supposed to speak of the work (Eusebius and Athanasius) do so merely under the 
name "Teaching of the Apostles"; the addition of "Twelve" being superfluous when 
the word "Apostle" had become limited to the Twelve. In the work itself 
"Apostle" is used in a very wide sense; so that if this really represents church 
usage when it was written, the title<PB id=Page_934 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y"

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>"Teaching of the Apostles" would be quite vague without 
the addition "Twelve" (cf. <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+6:13,Revelation+21:14," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.3>Luke vi. 13; Rev. xxi. 14</A>).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.4>The title was only intended to describe the substance of 
the work, not to assert anything as to its direct authorship. Though called 
"Teaching (<I>Didaché</I>) of the Lord," our Lord is certainly not represented 
as the speaker; see such expressions as "concerning these things spake the 
Lord," "as the Lord ordered in His Gospel," "as ye have in the Gospel of our 
Lord." Neither is it written in the name of the twelve apostles; for the author 
uses the singular, addressing his disciple as "my child." Nor does the treatise 
contain any indication that the author of the whole claimed to be one of the 
apostles, or that the work is to be broken up into sections supposed to be 
spoken by successive apostles. In this respect it is favourably distinguished 
from a number of spurious works which claimed apostolic authorship in early 
times. But, as in the case of the Apostles' Creed, a title apparently originally 
only intended to assert conformity with apostolic teaching, came to be 
understood as an assertion of authorship, and later authorities undertook to 
specify the portions contributed by each apostle; and later works founded on the 
<I>Didaché</I> are divided into sections supposed to be contributed by 
individual apostles.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.5>The work divides into two parts: the first, which we shall 
refer to as the " Two Ways," forming the first 6 chapters of Bryennius's ed., 
contains moral instruction; the second (cc. 7-15 Bryennius) deals with church 
ritual and discipline, a chapter (16) being added on our Lord's Second Coming. 
Several very early writers exhibit coincidences with pt. i., such as to prove 
that they borrowed from the <I>Didaché</I>, or the <I>Didaché</I> from them, or 
that both had a common source. With pt. ii. similar coincidences are much later 
and much more scanty. Part i. was intended for catechumens, or at least for use 
in their instruction, for part ii., which begins by treating of baptism, directs 
that candidates shall first have received the preceding teaching.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.6><I>Contents.</I>--The work begins by declaring that there 
are two ways: one of Life, the other of Death; phrases borrowed from <A 
class=scripRef href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Jeremiah+21:8," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.7>Jer. xxi. 8</A>, a passage itself derived from <A 
class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Deuteronomy+30:19," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.8>Deut. xxx. 19</A>. It then describes first the Way of Life, 
which is summed up in two precepts: love God Who made thee; and love thy 
neighbour as thyself and do not to another what thou wouldest not have done to 
thyself.<A class=Note 
href="http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.xx.iii.htm#_fnf1" 
name=_fnb1><SUP class=Note>1</SUP></A> Then follow several precepts from the 
Sermon on the Mount.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.11>As c. i. is based on the Sermon on the Mount, so is c. 
ii. on the second table of the Decalogue. C. iii. instructs the disciple to flee 
not only from every evil, but from everything like it. C. iv. contains 
miscellaneous precepts. C. v. gives an enumeration of the sins which constitute 
the way of death. C. vi. is a short exhortation to abide in the foregoing 
teaching; but giving permission if the disciple cannot bear the whole yoke, 
especially as regards food, to be content with bearing as much as he can; 
provided always he abstains from things offered to idols. Here terminates the 
section addressed to the catechumen. Then follow (c. vii.) directions for the 
baptism of candidates who have received the preceding instruction. It is to be 
in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; in running water if it can be had; 
if not, in any water, even warm water. If sufficient water for immersion is not 
at hand, it will suffice to pour water three times on the head. Baptizer and 
baptized must fast beforehand; the baptized for a day or two: others, if 
possible, to join in the fast. This rule of fasting may be illustrated by the 
account given in the Clementines (<I>Hom.</I> iii. 11; <I>Recog.</I> vii. 36) of 
the baptism of Clement's mother. Peter directs that she shall fast one day 
previous to baptism.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.12>C. viii. relates to fasting and prayer. The disciples 
must not fast "as the hypocrites," on the 2nd and 5th days of the week; but on 
the 4th and on the preparation day. Neither must they pray as the hypocrites, 
but as the Lord ordered in His Gospel. The Lord's Prayer is given in conformity 
with St. Matthew's text with but trifling variations, but adding the doxology 
"Thine is the power and the glory for ever." This prayer is to be used thrice 
daily. Chaps. ix. x. contain Eucharistic formulae. In the opening words 
"Concerning the thanksgiving, give thanks in this manner," we can scarcely avoid 
giving to the word <FONT face=symbol>eucaristia</FONT> the technical meaning it 
had as early as Ignatius (<I>Philad.</I> 4; <I>Smyrn.</I> 6, 8; <I>Eph.</I> 13; 
cf. Justin, <I>Apol.</I> 66). This interpretation is confirmed by a direction 
that of this "Eucharist" none but baptized persons should partake, since the 
Lord has said "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs." But the forms 
themselves are more like what we should expect in prayers before and after an 
ordinary meal than the Eucharist proper. There is no recital of the words of 
institution; no mention of the Body and Blood of our Lord, though both Ignatius 
and Justin Martyr so describe the consecrated food. The supposition that we have 
here private prayers to be said before and after reception is excluded by the 
direction that "prophets" should be permitted to offer thanks as they pleased, 
where it is plain that public thanksgiving is intended. The explanation seems to 
be that the celebration of the Eucharist still accompanied the Agape or Love 
Feast, and that we have here the thanksgivings before and after that meal. In 
the Clementines, which in several points manifest affinity with the 
<I>Didaché</I>, it is not merely the Eucharist from which the unbaptized are 
excluded. They can take no food of any kind at the same table with the 
initiated. An unbaptized person is the home of the demon, and until this demon 
has been driven out by baptism, no Christian can safely admit him to a common 
table (<I>Recog.</I> ii. 71; see also i. 19, vii. 36); and all<PB id=Page_935

      </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE>through the Clementines the language in which the 
benediction of every meal is described is such as to make it uncertain whether a 
celebration of the Eucharist is meant. In the form in the <I>Didaché</I> we 
notice that: (1) the benediction of the cup precedes that of the bread (see <A 
class=scripRef href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+22:17-19," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.13>Luke xxii. 17-19</A>). (2) The broken bread has the 
technical name <FONT face=symbol>to klasma</FONT>. (3) The thanksgiving for the 
cup runs: "We give thanks to Thee our Father, for the holy vine of Thy servant 
David which Thou hast made known to us through Thy servant Jesus." This 
expression the "vine of David" was known to Clement of Alexandria, who says of 
Christ (<I>Quis Dives Salv.</I> 29), "Who poured forth the wine, the blood of 
the vine of David, for our wounded souls." Elsewhere (<I>Paed.</I> i. 5), 
treating of <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Genesis+49," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.14>Gen. xlix.</A> "binding the colt to the vine," he interprets 
"the vine" of the Logos Who gives His blood, as the vine yields wine. (4) The 
benedictory prayer contains a petition that as the broken bread had been 
scattered on the mountains and had been brought together and made one, so might 
the church be collected together from the ends of the earth. (5) The 
thanksgiving prayer after reception is directed to be said "after being filled" 
(<FONT face=symbol>to emplhsqhnai</FONT>), words answering better to the 
conclusion of an Agape than of a Eucharistic celebration (cf. <I>Recog.</I> i. 
19).</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.15>Chaps. xi. xii. xiii. treat of the honour to be paid to 
Christian teachers, who are described as "apostles and prophets." This 
combination of terms reflects N.T. usage (<SCRIPREF id=iii.xx.iii.p1.16 
passage="I. Cor. xii. 28, 29; Eph. ii. 20, iii. 8, iv. 11">I. Cor. xii. 28, 29; 
Eph. ii. 20, iii. 8, iv. 11</SCRIPREF>). The word "apostle" in our document is 
not limited to the Twelve, but is used as our word "missionary." Every true 
apostle was a prophet, but only those prophets received the name apostle who 
were not fixed in one place, but accredited by churches on a mission to distant 
localities. This terminology is a proof of the antiquity of our document (see 
Lightfoot on the word Apostle, <I>Gal.</I> p. 92). The word was used by Jews to 
denote an envoy sent by the authorities at Jerusalem to Jews in foreign places, 
especially the envoy charged with the collection of the Temple tribute. Our 
document is solicitous to provide for the due entertainment of Christian 
missionaries, and yet to guard against the church's hospitality being traded on 
by impostors or lazy persons. Every apostle was to be received as the Lord; but 
if he wanted to prolong his stay beyond two days at most, he betrayed himself as 
a false prophet. Clearly the apostle is an envoy on his way to another place; 
for it could never have been intended to forbid a missionary to settle down in 
one spot for a longer period of preaching. The false apostle is said to betray 
himself if he asks for money or for a larger supply of travelling provisions 
than will provide for his next stage. There are commands in a similar spirit for 
the hospitable treatment of ordinary Christian strangers. If such a one wishes 
to settle among them, he must work at a handicraft or employ himself in some 
other way; but if he wants to eat the bread of idleness, he is one who makes 
merchandise of Christ (<FONT face=symbol>cristemporoV</FONT>). The use of this 
word by Pseudo-Ignatius (<I>ad Trall.</I> 6, <I>ad Magn.</I> 9) agrees with the 
conclusion, drawn from other considerations, that the interpolator was 
acquainted with the <I>Didaché</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.17>There is a command in which commentators have found a 
difficulty, that a prophet speaking in the spirit must not be proved nor tested. 
"Every sin shall be forgiven, but not that." Yet there follow marks for 
discerning the false prophet from the true. The subsequent history of Montanism 
casts a clear light on the subject. The bishops attempted to test the Montanist 
prophetesses by applying to them the formulae of exorcism, to find whether it 
were possible to cast out an evil spirit who possessed them. This the Montanists 
naturally resisted as a frightful indignity. Such testing by exorcism is here 
manifestly forbidden, as involving, if applied to one really inspired by the 
Spirit of God, the risk of incurring the penalties denounced by our Lord, in 
words plainly here referred to, upon blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. That this 
precept of the <I>Didaché</I> was apparently not quoted in the Montanist 
disputes is one of many indications that our document had only a very limited 
circulation. Hilgenfeld's notion, that the <I>Didaché</I> is as late as 
Montanism, is condemned both by the whole character of the document and by its 
silence on the vital question in the Montanist controversy, whether true 
prophets lost their self-command when prophesying. To label every early document 
which speaks of prophesying Montanistic is to ignore the fact that prophetical 
gifts were recognized in the early church, and that Montanism was an 
unsuccessful local attempt to revive pretensions to them after they had 
generally ceased to be regarded as an ordinary feature of church life.<A 
class=Note href="http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.xx.iii.htm#_fnf2" 
name=_fnb2><SUP class=Note>2</SUP></A> The <I>Didaché</I> gives a different way 
of discerning the false prophet from the true, viz. by his life and 
conversation. If he taught the truth but did not practise it, he was a false 
prophet. He might, when speaking in the spirit, command gifts to be bestowed on 
others; but if he asked anything for himself, or gave commands in the benefit of 
which he was to share, he was a false prophet. But a true prophet, settling in 
one place, deserves his maintenance. So also does a teacher, by which apparently 
is meant a preacher who does not speak in prophetic ecstasy. To the prophets are 
to be given the first-fruits of all produce; "for they are your high priests." 
If there are no prophets, the first-fruits are to go to the poor.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.18>C. xiv. directs Christians to come together each Lord's 
Day to break bread and give thanks, having confessed their sins in order that 
their sacrifice may be pure. Those at variance must not pollute the sacrifice by 
coming without having been first reconciled. Our document then quotes <A 
class=scripRef href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Malachi+1:10," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.19>Mal. i. 10</A>, in which so many Fathers from Justin 
downwards (<I>Trypho</I>, 41, 116) have seen a prediction of the Eucharistic 
oblation. C. xv. begins: "Elect therefore to yourselves bishops and deacons." 
These are to receive the same honour as the prophets and teachers, as fulfilling 
a like ministration. In the preceding chapters where church officers are spoken 
of, mention<PB id=Page_936 thmlized="Y" proofread="Y" corrected="Y" n="936">

teachers; and of these, apostles are only stranger visitors of the church, and 
prophets are men endowed with supernatural gifts of the Holy Ghost, who may or 
may not be found in any particular church. Bearing in mind the account given by 
Justin (<I>Apol.</I> i. 66) of the share taken by "the president" and the 
deacons in the Eucharistic celebration, we seem warranted in inferring from the 
"therefore" at the beginning of c. xv. that it was with a view to the conduct of 
the weekly stated service that bishops and deacons are described as appointed; 
and that, though gifted men were allowed to preach and teach in the church 
assemblies, the offering of the Eucharist was confined to these permanent 
officers. It is possible that the section on "bishops and deacons" may have been 
added later when the <I>Didaché</I> assumed its present form, the editor feeling 
it necessary that mention should be made of the recognized names of the officers 
of the church in his time.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.20>C. xvi. is an exhortation to watch for our Lord's Second 
Coming, in order to be able to pass safely through the heavy trial that was 
immediately to precede it. This time of trial was to be signalized by the 
appearance of one who is called the "deceiver of the world" (<FONT 
face=symbol>kosmoplanoV</FONT>), who should appear as God's Son and do signs and 
wonders, and into whose hands the earth should be delivered, so that under the 
trial many should be scandalized and be lost (cf. <SCRIPREF id=iii.xx.iii.p1.21 
passage="II. Thess. ii. 3, 4; Rev. xii. 9; Matt. xxiv. 21, 24, x. 22">II. Thess. 
ii. 3, 4; Rev. xii. 9; Matt. xxiv. 21, 24, x. 22</SCRIPREF>). But then shall 
appear the signs of the truth: first the sign of outspreading (<FONT 
face=symbol>ekpetasewV</FONT>) in heaven (a difficult phrase which need not here

Him. Then shall the world see the Lord coming on the clouds of heaven.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.23><I>External Attestation.</I>--The sketch just given shews 
that our document bears marks of very high antiquity. We next ask what ancient 
writers expressly speak of the <I>Didaché</I>, or manifest acquaintance with it, 
earlier than the appearance in its present shape of the <I>Apostolic 
Constitutions</I>, the first half of bk. vii. of which contains an expansion of 
the <I>Didaché</I>. The forger of this book was plainly acquainted with the 
whole <I>Didaché</I>; for he goes through it from beginning to end, making 
changes and additions, the study of which throws interesting light on the 
development of church ritual during the interval between the two works. Harnack 
has given good reasons for thinking that the same forger manipulated the 
<I>Didaché</I> and the Ignatian letters, and that his work may have been as 
early as A.D. 350. Hence the <I>Didaché</I> was by then an ancient document, but 
one in such small circulation that it could be tampered with without much fear 
of detection.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.24>It is necessary here to notice the tract professing to 
contain apostolic constitutions, published by Bickell in 1843 and described 
<I>D. C. A.</I> i. 123. This is quite independent of and earlier than the work 
commonly known as the <I>Apostolic Constitutions</I>. The two forms employ some 
common earlier documents, but there is no reason to think that the framer of 
either was acquainted with the other. Bickel calls this tract <I>Apostolische 
Kirchenordnung</I>, and to avoid confusion with the <I>Apostolic 
Constitutions</I>, we refer to it as the <I>Church Ordinances</I>. It had been 
translated into various languages, and is the foundation of Egyptian Canon Law. 
It has so much in common with Bryennius's <I>Didaché</I> that either the 
<I>Church Ordinances</I> certainly used the <I>Didaché</I> or both drew from a 
common source. In form they differ; for in the <I>Ordinances</I> the precepts 
are distributed among different apostles by name, the list being peculiar, 
Cephas appearing as distinct from Peter; he and Nathanael taking the place of 
James the Less and Matthias. In substance the two works closely coincide, but 
only in the section on the "Two Ways."</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.25>Writers earlier than the <I>Apostolic Constitutions</I> 
know of a work which professed to contain the teaching of the apostles, but 
concerning them we cannot say with certainty whether the work to which they 
witness is the same as ours. The list of direct witnesses is indeed much shorter 
than it must have been if the work had obtained any wide acceptance as 
containing really apostolic instruction. Earliest is Eusebius, who to his list 
of canonical Scriptures (<I>H. E.</I> iii. 25) adds a list of spurious books of 
the better sort, recognized by church writers, and to be distinguished from 
writings which heretics had forged in the names of apostles. Among these he 
enumerates next after the Ep. of Barnabas, "what are called the Teachings of the 
Apostles" (<FONT face=symbol>tvn apostolwn ai legomenai didacai</FONT>). Some 
years later Athanasius (<I>Ep. Fest.</I> 39) adds to his list of canonical 
Scriptures a list of non-canonical books useful in the catechetical instruction 
of converts, viz. the Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach, Esther, Judith, 
Tobit, the so-called Teaching of the Apostles (<FONT face=symbol>didach 
kaloumenh tvn apostolon</FONT>), and the Shepherd. The only obstacle to our 
supposing our <I>Didaché</I> to be here referred to is the Eucharistic formulae 
it contains, which Athanasius would scarcely place in the hands of the 
uninitiated, unless indeed he thought them so unlike the truth as to make no 
revelation of Christian mysteries. It will be observed that Eusebius uses the 
plural (<FONT face=symbol>didacai</FONT>), Athanasius the singular. Unmistakable 
coincidences with the <I>Didaché</I> have been pointed out in writings ascribed 
to Athanasius, but rejected as spurious in the Benedictine ed., though the 
genuineness of at least the second of these is still urged: viz. <I>de 
Virginitate</I> (Migne, p. 266), <I>Syntagma Doctrinae ad Monaches</I> (p. 835), 
and <I>Fides Nicena</I> (p. 1639). Among the spurious writings printed with 
those of Athanasius is a <I>Synopsis Sacrae Scripturae</I>, which, because of 
its coincidences with the <I>Stichometry</I> of Nicephorus, Credner has dated as 
late as 10th cent. The <I>Stichometry</I> doubtless preserves an ancient list, 
and there among the apocryphal books appended to the N.T. Canon we find the 
<FONT face=symbol>didach apostolwn</FONT>. Those that precede it are heretical 
apocrypha; but those that follow, viz. the Epp. of Clement, Ignatius, Polycarp, 
and the Shepherd, are all orthodox. The number of <FONT 
face=symbol>sticoi</FONT> attributed to the Didache is 200; whereas 1,400 are<PB

founded on stichometry are uncertain; so we cannot lay much stress on the fact 
that this appears to indicate a somewhat shorter work than Bryennius's <FONT 
face=symbol>didach</FONT>, which according to Harnack would make about 300 <FONT 
face=symbol>sticoi</FONT>. and on a rough estimate seems about a quarter the 
length of the Apocalypse. A list of 60 books of Scripture appended to a writing 
of Anastasius, patriarch of Antioch in the reign of Justinian, is in Westcott's 
<I>N.T. Canon</I>, p. 550. This gives as an appendix a list of apocryphal books; 
one being the <I>Travels</I> (<FONT face=symbol>periodoi</FONT>) <I>and 
Teachings</I> (<FONT face=symbol>didacai</FONT>) <I>of the Apostles</I>. The 
absence of the <I>Didaché</I> from the list of the <I>Codex Claromontanus</I> 
agrees with other indications that this work possessed no authority in Africa. 
In one of the fragments, published by Pfaff, as from Irenaeus, we read: "Those 
who have followed the <I>Second Ordinances of the Apostles</I> (<FONT 
face=symbol>oi taiV deuteraiV tvn apostolwn diataxesi parhkolouqhkoteV</FONT>) 
know that our Lord instituted a new offering in the New Covenant according to 
the saying of Malachi the prophet, 'From the rising of the sun to the going 
down, my name has been glorified in the Gentiles; and in every place incense is 
offered to my name and a pure offering.'" This passage is quoted in the 
<I>Didaché</I> with reference to the Eucharist; not, however, textually, as in 
the fragment, but very loosely. We can only say then that it is <I>possible</I> 
the <I>Didaché</I> may be the <I>Second Ordinances of the Apostles</I> referred 
to here. The fragment is probably ancient, but contains a citation of 
<I>Hebrews</I> as St. Paul's, which proves, as Zahn and others have remarked, 
that Irenaeus could not have been the author.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.26>Western testimony to the <I>Didaché</I> is scanty, and 
rather indicates that any book which circulated in the West as the <I>Teaching 
of the Apostles</I> was not the same as Bryennius's <I>Didaché</I>. Rufinus 
(<I>Comm. in Symb. Apost.</I> 38) gives a list of canonical books which bears 
marks of derivation from that of Athanasius; but where the <I>Didaché</I> should 
come he has "qui appellatur Duae viae vel Judicium Petri." This suggests that 
either the entire <I>Didaché</I> or at least the first half, the "Two Ways," had 
been translated into Latin and circulated under the name of the <I>Judgment of 
Peter</I>, to whom, and not to the apostles generally, the authorship would seem 
to have been ascribed. The existence of a Latin "Two Ways" is independently 
proved by the discovery of a fragment by von Gebhardt, reprinted in his <I>Texte 
und Untersuchungen</I>, ii. 277. It is so short as to leave it undetermined 
whether the Latin version contained anything corresponding to what follows the 
"Two Ways" in Bryennius. Lactantius (<I>Div. Instit.</I> vi. 3, etc., and 
<I>Epit.</I> c. 59) gives an unmistakable expansion of the teaching of the "Two 
Ways," who must have used our Latin version, thus proving it older than A.D. 
310.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.27>The treatise <I>de Aleatoribus</I>, falsely ascribed to 
Cyprian, contains a quotation from <I>Doctrina Apostolorum</I> (Hartel, ii. 96) 
not found in the <I>Didaché</I>, though there is one passage (xiv. 2) which 
might have suggested the idea to the framer of the Latin. If we may ever rely on 
the argument from silence, we should gather from Tertullian's discussion on the 
"Stations" (<I>de Orat.</I> 19, <I>de Jejun.</I> 2, 10, 14) that he was 
unacquainted with our document. Thus, scanty though the Western notices are, 
they seem to prove that the <I>Didaché</I>, in Bryennius's form, never 
circulated in the West; that the Latin <I>Doctrina Apostolorum</I>, even as 
regards the section on the "Two Ways," was not a translation of Bryennius's 
<I>Didaché</I>, but contained a different manipulation of a prtibably common 
original; and that beyond the "Two Ways" there is no evidence that the Latin 
form had anything in common with the <I>Didaché</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.28>We now come to coincidences with the <I>Didaché</I> in 
works which do not mention it by name. Far the most important of these are found 
in the Ep. of Barnabas, in which, after the conclusion of the doctrinal 
teaching, the writer proposes to pass to another doctrine and discipline (<FONT 
face=symbol>gnwsin kai didachn</FONT>), and adds an appendix of moral 
instructions. This appendix agrees so completely in substance with the section 
on the Two Ways that a literary connexion between the two documents is 
indisputable. But there is great diversity of detail. The precepts in Barnabas 
are without any orderly arrangement, while the <I>Didaché</I> contains a 
systematic comment on the second table of the Decalogue. Bryennius differs from 
later critics and some earlier ones who consider it probable that Barnabas was 
the borrower. The whole character of the <I>Didaché</I> makes it unlikely that 
its author collected the precepts scattered in Barnabas's appendix, digested 
them into systematic order, and made a number of harmonious additions; while if 
in what Barnabas says about the "Two Ways" he is but reproducing an older 
document, his unsystematic way of quoting its precepts, just as they came to 
mind, is quite like his mode of dealing with O.T. We have still to inquire 
whether Barnabas borrowed from the <I>Didaché</I> or from a common source. Now a 
study of the <I>Didaché</I>, as compared with Jewish literature, shews very 
clearly its origin among men with Jewish training, and the work from which both 
borrowed may have been not only Jewish but pre-Christian. For Barnabas's letter 
is of so early a date that, if we suppose him to have copied an earlier 
Christian document, we bring that document into the apostolic age, which would 
give it all the authority that has been claimed for it. We must, then, in 
comparing Barnabas with the <I>Didaché</I>, distinguish carefully the specially 
Christian element from those parts which might have been written by a Jew 
unacquainted with Christianity. If Barnabas copied the <I>Didaché</I>, he would 
have naturally included the Christian element. If Barnabas and the 
<I>Didaché</I> independently copied an originally Jewish document, the Christian 
elements they might add would not be likely to be the same. In the section in 
Barnabas we are struck by the extreme meagreness of the Christian element. There 
is no mention of our Lord, scarcely any coincidence with N.T. language, very 
little that might not have been written by a Jew before our Lord's coming. In 
the <I>Didaché</I> coincidences with N.T. are extremely numerous, end it begins

entirely absent from Barnabas. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that 
Barnabas did not know the <I>Didaché</I> in Bryennius's form. He has elsewhere 
coincidences with N.T., and had no motive for avoiding them. If a book before 
him contained a number of N.T. precepts he would never have studiously avoided 
these in using the work, nor have forgotten them even if he wrote from memory. 
The coincidences between the two works, therefore, must be explained by the use 
of a common document.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.29>This conclusion is confirmed on taking into the 
comparison also the Latin "Two Ways," and the Egyptian <I>Church Ordinances</I>, 
both of which, like Barnabas, do not recognize the <I>Didaché</I> section 
founded on the Sermon on the Mount. Neither is this section recognized in 
Pseudo-Athanasius. The <I>Church Ordinances</I> exhibit signs of acquaintance 
with Barnabas; the Latin form does not. In the order of the precepts the 
<I>Ordinances</I> and the Latin both agree with the <I>Didaché</I> against 
Barnabas. The <I>Ordinances</I> differ from the Latin by excess, but scarcely at 
all otherwise. The same reasons that forbid us to think that Barnabas, if he had 
known the <I>Didaché</I>, would have left out its Christian element, prove the 
<I>Ordinances</I> and the Latin likewise independent of the <I>Didaché.</I> The 
phenomena are explained if we assume an original document in substantial 
agreement with the Latin, enlarged in the <I>Didaché</I> by additions from N.T., 
and afterwards independently enlarged by the framer of the <I>Church 
Ordinances</I>, who broke it up into sections supposed to be spoken by different 
apostles; while Barnabas worked up in his own way the materials he drew from the 
document. We cannot say positively whether this original proceeded beyond the 
"Two Ways." The Latin fragment breaks off too soon to give any information as to 
the length of the original: the <I>Church Ordinances</I> cease to present 
coincidences with the <I>Didaché</I> after the section on the "Two Ways"; but 
this may be because the directions for ritual and discipline had become out of 
date when the <I>Ordinances</I> were put together, the editor therefore 
designedly substituting what better agreed with the practice of his own age. The 
quotation by Pseudo-Cyprian leads us to think that the Latin <I>Doctrina 
Apostolorum</I> did go beyond the "Two Ways." No great weight can be attached to 
the length ascribed to the <I>Didaché</I> in the <I>Stichometry</I>, but this 
rather favours the idea that the document intended was longer than the "Two 
Ways," but shorter than the <I>Didaché</I> of Bryennius.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.30>It remains to be mentioned that there is a coincidence 
between Barnabas and the <I>Didaché</I> outside the "Two Ways." The opening of 
the Ep. of Barnabas and the last or eschatological chapter of the <I>Didaché</I> 
both contain the warning that the disciples' faith would not profit them unless 
they remained stedfast in the last times. There is a good deal of difference in 
the wording of the warning, but not more than is usual in quotations by 
Barnabas. The supposition that Barnabas was acquainted with Bryennius's form of 
the <I>Didaché</I> has already been excluded; therefore either (1) the earlier 
form which Barnabas did use included an eschatological chapter containing this 
warning, or (2) the editor who changed the earlier form into that of Bryennius 
was acquainted with the Ep. of Barnabas. We prefer (2), on account of the 
reasons we shall presently give for thinking the document used by Barnabas to 
have been pre-Christian. If the editor of Bryennius's form knew Hermas, he might 
also have known Barnabas, with whom he has a second coincidence in a passage 
about almsgiving, which, as implying a knowledge of Acts and Romans, Barnabas 
was not likely to have found in his original. Possibly there is a third 
coincidence; for a plausible explanation of the difficult word <FONT 
face=symbol>ekpetasiV</FONT> in c. xvi. is that it means the sign of the cross, 
being derived from Barnabas's interpretation of <FONT 
face=symbol>ezepetasa</FONT>in <A class=scripRef 
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Isaiah+65:2," 
id=iii.xx.iii.p1.31>Is. lxv. 2</A>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.32>Hermas also presents coincidences with the 
<I>Didaché</I>, but it is not easy to say that there is literary obligation on 
either side, except in one case, viz. a coincidence between the second 
"commandment" of Hermas and the "Sermon on the Mount" section, which we have 
already seen reason to think belongs to a later form of the <I>Didaché</I>. In 
this case the original seems clearly that of Hermas. His instructions as to 
almsgiving are perfectly clear. The corresponding passage in the <I>Didaché</I> 
has many coincidences of language, but expresses the thought so awkwardly as to 
be scarce intelligible without the commentary of Hermas. It begins, "Blessed is 
he that giveth according to the commandment, for he is blameless: woe to him 
that receiveth." The words "for he is blameless," as they stand, are puzzling; 
for we should expect the "for" to introduce something stronger than merely an 
acquittal of blame. By comparison with Hermas we see that the case contemplated 
is that of giving to an undeserving person. Then the receiver deserves the woe; 
the giver obtains an acquittal. We conclude, then, without disputing the greater 
antiquity of the original <I>Didaché</I>, that the interpolator who brought the 
work to the form published by Bryennius was later than Hermas, and drew from 
him.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.33>Clement of Alexandria was certainly acquainted with the 
<I>Didaché</I> in some form. He expressly quotes one sentence as Scripture 
(<I>Strom.</I> i. 20, p. 377), "My son, be not a liar, for lying leads to 
theft." This saying is not quoted by Barnabas; but the <I>Church Ordinances</I> 
attest that it belongs to the earlier form of the <I>Didaché</I>. Even the later 
form of the <I>Didaché</I> may well be considerably older than Clement; and he 
might easily have met with a copy during his travels in the East. He uses 
(<I>Quis Dives Salv.</I> 20) the phrase "vine of David," found in one of the 
benedictory prayers of the <I>Didaché</I>. He shews a knowledge (<I>Strom.</I> 
vii. 7, p. 854) of the Wednesday and Friday fasts (c. 12, p. 877), but does not 
seem to attribute to these institutions the authority which belongs to the name 
Scripture bestowed by him on the <I>Didaché</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.34>Origen was later than Clement and must have been well 
acquainted with the literature current in Egypt and Palestine; so that we might 
naturally expect him to be familiar with the <I>Didaché</I>. Yet no satisfactory 
proof of his knowledge of it has been produced.</P><PB id=Page_939 thmlized="Y"

<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.35><I>Place of Composition.</I>--The <I>Church 
Ordinances</I>, at the basis of which lies the <I>Didaché</I> in some form, are 
with good reason regarded as of Egyptian origin; Clement, one of the earliest to 
quote the <I>Didaché</I>, wrote in Egypt, and so very possibly did Barnabas. 
Hence, it was natural to think that the <I>Didaché</I> also is of Egyptian 
origin. But attention was called to the petition in the prayer of benediction of 
the bread, that as it had been scattered <I>on the mountains</I>, and collected 
together had become one, so the church might be collected together from the ends 
of the earth into the Lord's kingdom; and it was pointed out the words "on the 
mountains" could not have been written in Egypt; and, moreover, the proper 
inference from the use made of the <I>Didaché</I> in the <I>Church 
Ordinances</I> is that when the latter work was put together, the former was 
almost unknown in Egypt. There is nothing to contradict the inference suggested 
by the intensely Jewish character of the book, that it emanated from Christian 
Jews who, after the destruction of Jerusalem, had their chief settlements E. of 
Jordan.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.36><I>Time of Composition.</I>--The theory set forth is that 
the original, alike of Barnabas and of all the forms of the <I>Didaché</I>, was 
a Jewish manual for the instruction of proselytes. If Palestinian Christians had 
habitually used such a manual while still Jews, it would be natural for them to 
employ it, improved by the addition of some Christian elements, in the moral 
instruction of converts before admission into the church. The document, being a 
formula in constant practical use, would be added to and modified; and we seem 
to be able to trace three stages in its growth.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.37>(1) Barnabas represents for us the original Jewish 
manual; probably quoting, not from any written document, but from his 
recollection of the instruction he had himself received or had been given to 
others. Barnabas's quotations do not proceed beyond the section on the "Two 
Ways," corresponding to cc. i.-iv. of the <I>Didaché</I>.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.38>(2) In the <I>Church Ordinances</I> and in the Latin 
<I>Doctrina</I> we have the manual as it was modified for use in a Christian 
community. The Latin book may have been the first publication of this 
catechetical manual of Palestinian Christians, brought to the West by one 
himself instructed in it. It was probably called the <I>Teaching of the 
Apostles</I>, because the authorized formulary of a church founded by apostles 
and claiming to derive its institutions from them. We are without evidence 
whether this manual contained more than the "Two Ways," though it probably did. 
The only clue to the date of this publication is that the <I>Church 
Ordinances</I> contain that precept about almsgiving which we have already noted 
as the solitary instance of use of the N.T. in this section of Barnabas. Reasons 
have been already given for thinking that Barnabas was not here employing a 
Christian document, and we find it hard to believe that the phrases in which 
coincidences occur are older than N.T., so we seem forced to conclude that the 
first editors of the <I>Teaching of the Apostles</I> knew Barnabas. This would 
not be inconsistent with a date before the end of 1st cent.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p1.39>(3) In the <I>Didaché</I> published by Bryennius we have 
the manual enlarged by further Christian additions; the precepts in the original 
manual being expanded, others added from N.T., and also some wholly new 
sections. Yet the whole character of the <I>Didaché</I>, and in particular the 
lively expectation of our Lord's Second Coming in c. xvi., disposes us to give 
it in its present form as early a date as we can; and since we place Hermas at 
the beginning of 2nd cent., we have no difficulty in dating the Didache as early 
as A.D. 120.</P>
<P id=iii.xx.iii.p2><I>Literature.</I>--The publication of the <I>Didaché</I> by 
Bryennius produced an enormous crop of literature. The lists in Schaff's and in 
Harnack's editions may be supplemented by an article of Harnack's <I>Theol. 
Literaturz.</I> 1886, p. 271. Here we only mention, of editions, those by De 
Romestan (1884), Spence (1885), Schaff (1885 and 1886), Sabatier (1885), 
Hilgenfeld in a 2nd ed. of pt. iv. of his <I>Nov. Test. ext. Can.</I> (1884), 
and by Gebhardt and Harnack, <I>Texte und Untersuchungen</I>, vol. ii. (1884).
