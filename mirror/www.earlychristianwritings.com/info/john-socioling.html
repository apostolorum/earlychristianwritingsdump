J. Malina, Christian Origins and Cultural Anthropology. Atlanta: John Knox,

<HR>
<BR><BR>
<DD>It is a truism in New Testament studies that the Gospel of John (= Jn) is 
different from the other gospel documents in the Christian canon. Jn has been 
quite appropriately labelled "the maverick gospel" (<A 
href="#Ky">Kysar</A> 1976). 
Yet the quality of Jn's uniqueness has yet to be articulated in some way beyond 
simple intuition or tortuous and impressionistic excursions into style and 
"theology." If it is true that the meanings encoded in a text<A 
href="#1">(1)</A> derive 
ultimately from a social system (see <A 
href="#Do">Douglas</A> 
1971), it might be useful to look into the social system revealed in and 
presupposed by Jn to generate insight into the distinctive features of this text 
(see <A 
href="#1982">Malina</A> 
1982; 1983). And if it is true that language is essentially a form of social 
interaction, and that people "language" each other in order to mean, then it 
might be equally useful to consider the type of language in Jn within the 
framework of sociolinguistics (see <A 
href="#Fi">Fishman</A> 1971; 
<A href="#Fo">Fowler</A> 
1977; <A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 
1978; <A 
href="#Hu">Hudson</A> 1980). 
From a sociolinguistic standpoint, what persons talk about is meaningful to 
their conversation partners not so much because these partners do not know what 
a speaker (or writer) is going to say, but because the partners do know. Any 
listener or reader has abundant evidence of what some speaker or writer is going 
to say both from his/her knowledge of how the language works and from practiced 
sensibility to what one in fact can say in specific situations. For example, an 
American church-goer is generally rather certain that the Sunday sermon will not 
be about the Victorian novel or recent economic theories about Third World 
import quotas, or the proper chemical formulas for describing the structure of 
crystals. Players talking in a huddle during a football game will not be 
conversing about permanent life insurance, Zen Buddhism, or the stock market. 
And persons at the site of an auto accident witnessing a physician speaking with 
an injured person can be fairly certain they are not speaking about Chinese 
cooking, the price of eggs, the problems of adolescence, farming in the 
sub-Sahara or the crime rate in Calcutta. As a rule, members of various social 
groups can predict the types of meanings that might be exchanged from the 
situations in which speaking takes place.<BR>
<DD>For interpreters of ancient historical texts, what is of interest, of 
course, is the converse of that observation. Given sufficient pieces of 
conversation (i.e. text), can one form an idea of the types of situations 
befitting a given communication and the range of meanings generally exchanged in 
such situations? Contemporaries do in fact infer the situation from meanings 
imparted in language. Every time a person observes: "you must have read that in 
newspaper X (or magazine Y, or novel Z; or heard that on T.V. show A)," s/he is 
inferring a situation in which only a limited range of meanings can be imparted. 
Given the information communicated in Jn, can one infer the type of situation in 
which that sort of information could have been imparted? To answer this 
question, what is necessary is a comparative set of social locations along with 
some device for situating a text such as Jn in a given location with some 
relative degree of adequacy and accuracy. The next step is to situate Jn within 
the appropriate social location, and then take note of the applicable 
generalizations that might be forthcoming.<A 
href="#2">(2)</A><BR>
<DD>What I should like to offer for discussion here, then is such a comparative 
set of social locations along with two devices for situating Jn (and other New 
Testament texts) within that model: the type of story Jn tells and the type of 
language Jn uses in telling his story (on such models and their use for 
understanding antiquity, see <A 
href="#Ca">Carney</A> 1975). 
For the comparative set of social locations, I use Mary Douglas' grid and group 
model (<A 
href="#Do">Douglas</A> 1973; 
1978; <A href="#DoI">Douglas 
and Isherwood</A> 1979), with appropriate modifications. The two devices for 
situating the text called Jn into the social location model are Hayden White's 
model of metahistory (<A 
href="#Wh">White</A> 1973; 
see History and Theory Beiheft 19, 1980 for a set of essays on the model) and 
Michael A. K. Halliday's sociolinguistic (<A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 
1978; for its historical moorings, see <A 
href="#Mon">Monaghan</A> 
1979).<BR><BR><BR><FONT size=4>1. Social Locations: Douglas' Grid and 
Group</FONT><BR><BR>
<DD>Douglas's grid and group model is rather simple in that it deals with two 
variables (see figure 1). The first of these is the degree to which a person is 
embedded in other persons, and this feature is called group. The second is the 
degree to which persons find their commonly shared values to match their 
experiences, and this feature is called grid. The group can be stronger or 
weaker depending on the extent of personal embeddedness, running from total, 
strong group, to individualistic weak group. Similarly a high match of values 
and experience is high grid, while a low match on the same scale is low grid. A 
matrix consisting of a horizontal group line crossing a vertical grid line 
yields a set of quadrants. Figure 1 on the next page comes outfitted with the 
salient features of each quadrant. Since the purpose of this essay is not to 
explain Douglas' grid and group model, suffice it to say that it is intended to 
be a polythetic typology (<A 
href="#Ba">Bailey</A> 1973) 
in that all features listed need not be present for an appropriate and adequate 
fit. Further explanation of the salient features of each quadrant can be found 
in <A href="#Do">Douglas</A> 
1973; 1978; <A 
href="#Is">Isenberg and 
Owen</A> 1977, with applications to early Christianity in <A 
href="#1978">Malina</A> 
1978; 1981. With a view to interpreting the text called Jn, it seems more useful 
here to develop a more fitting model for this purpose by superimposing White's 
model of historical explanation over the Douglas model (see figure 2). What 
needs explanation now is White's classification of historians and their stories 
in the resulting comparative perspective.<BR><BR><BR><FONT size=4>2. White's 
Metahistorical Model</FONT><BR>
<DD>To begin with, White (<A 
href="#Wh">1973:</A> 1-42) 
notes that every story teller, whether professional historian or not, must 
necessarily adjust the "historical field" in the following five ways. The 
historian, first of all, must arrange elements of the historical field in some 
sort of sequence of occurrences. This sequence of occurrences is the "temporal" 
order culturally acceptable to story-teller and audience alike. Then the 
historian must transform this sequence, or "chronicle" of events into a 
meaningful flow of action with a beginning, middle and end. Thus the historians 
must choose from the chronicle: beginning elements, concluding elements and 
transition elements—omitting much in between. This choosing from the chronicle 
is a procedure involving constrained selection, exclusion, emphasis and 
deemphasis. These constraints are imposed upon the historians by the type of 
story s/he wishes to tell. The type of story is plot and plot derives from modes 
of plotting, modes of emplotment.<BR>
<DD>Emplotment refers to the direction given to the flow of events in a story. 
It answers such "story" questions as: what happened next? How did it happen? Why 
this way rather than that? How did it come out in the end? These questions are 
answered, usually implicitly, as the historian tells his story from equilibrium 
to equilibrium through disequilibrium. White suggests that there are only four 
modes of emplotment: comedy, tragedy, satire, romance (these are defined at the 
bottom of figure 2). On the grid and group axes, comedy covers high grid, 
tragedy low grid; and satire says the same as strong group, while romance looks 
to weak group. Historians, then, tells stories that are either romantic comedies 
or romantic tragedies, satiric comedies or satiric tragedies. As far as our New 
Testament sources are concerned, I see John as a romantic tragedy, while the 
Synoptics are satiric tragedies. Now as the plot line unfolds, White tells us 
that historians inevitably inform their audiences or readerships about the point 
of it all, and this he calls the mode of formal argument.<BR>
<DD>The mode of formal argument indicates how historical explanations fit into 
some broader frame, thus yielding the culturally acceptable "point of it all." 
Of course this broader frame is the set of values and structures that make up 
the social system of the historian and his/her audience. By telling stories 
making the same "point of it all," historians help their societies maintain 
current social postures and affirm their way of life. White follows Pepper (<A 
href="#Pe">Pepper</A> 1942; 
1945; and most clearly for historical study, <A 
href="#Pe">1967:</A> 
319-377) and his well-known four modes of formal argument: formist, 
contextualist, organicist and mechanist. Consider each, briefly:<BR>
<UL>
  <DD><B>(a) Formist:</B> explanation here consists in properly identifying 
  objects, their class, general qualities, specific attributes, while assigning 
  and labelling them to point up particularity and uniqueness. This mode of 
  argument is weak group/low grid because of its focus on (generalized) 
  individuals and particular unique features (this is weak group), while 
  rejecting any sorts of laws or principles because of a lack of close phasing 
  between universal values and individual experience (this is low grid).<BR>
  <DD><B>(b) Contextualist:</B> events are placed within the context of their 
  occurrence to point up the interrelationships involved, demonstrating how they 
  work together to produce the effects that they do. This mode of argument is 
  weak group/high grid because of its focus on individual events with the 
  purpose of determining the pragmatic effects of events and what causes them 
  (this is weak group), while assuming there is a continuity between events and 
  their contexts in some recurring relationship (this is high grid). The 
  production of trends, tendencies and general profiles derivable from 
  ascertainable regularities points to high grid confidence (this paper belongs 
  in this quadrant).<BR>
  <DD><B>(c) Organicist:</B> explanation here consists in putting facts within 
  some integral whole picture consisting of rather abstract principles or 
  recurring ideas that control history in its inexorable progression to its 
  goal(s). This mode of argument is strong group/high grid because individuals 
  (whether persons, events, objects or whatever) are subservient to larger 
  historical processes, hence simply components and replications of the total 
  group which is itself a piece of some cosmic process (this is the strong group 
  aspect). Further, history demonstrates how the purposive laws governing the 
  inevitable historical process (Truth) are always verifiable in contemporary 
  human experience (this is the high grid aspect).<BR>
  <DD><B>(d) Mechanist:</B> explanation here consists in placing facts within 
  some larger picture which itself does not explain everything. It is simply a 
  larger total picture, part of some unknown and unknowable whole. The immediate 
  larger picture does in fact explain pivotal regularities by seeking out 
  recurrent causes which determine \ the outcomes discernible in the historical 
  field. This mode of argument is strong group/low grid because the individual 
  is necessarily controlled by forces above and beyond him/her, lying at the 
  unknown and unknowable periphery of the larger picture (this is the strong 
  group aspect: the prescribed individual), indicating that human beings alone 
  cannot attain their goals they set for themselves (this is the low grid 
  aspect).</DD></UL>
<DD>White goes on to explain what he calls "the mode of ideological 
implication," that implicit dimension of a story that tells the reader or hearer 
what s/he ought to do about it now that s/he has heard/read the story. These, 
briefly, are the anarchist (destroy the present), the liberal (fine tune the 
present, while looking to a long term future), conservative (maintain the 
present at all costs as it grinds on inexorably to some certain and secure 
future), and radical (now, soon, society must be restructured on a new basis, 
hence focus on some immediate future). The accompanying chart indicates where 
these fit in the grid and group matrix. While these modes of ideological 
implication are interesting, it would seem more useful for our purposes to focus 
on mode of formal argument, since it seems that category is the easiest to 
discern for purposes of comparative generalization.<BR>
<DD>The modes of formal argument: formist, contextualist, organicist and 
mechanist, might profitably be considered in terms of the following categories 
of semantic analysis (White here uses <A 
href="#Bu">Kenneth Burke</A> 
1969: 3-20): location, agent, act, object, agency, purpose, outcome. Again 
briefly:<BR>
<UL>* <B>location</B> refers to the scene, physical, social and cultural, the 
  when/where of the story;<BR>* <B>agent</B> refers to the animate instigator of 
  the action, the who;<BR>* <B>act</B> refers to the action, state or change of 
  state being described, the what is going on;<BR>* <B>object</B> refers to the 
  focus of the act, the whom or what;<BR>
  <DD>if the object is animate it is the "patient," if inanimate it is simply 
  "object";<BR>* <B>agency</B> refers to the means by which action takes place, 
  the how;<BR>* <B>purpose</B> refers to the goals of the agents in the story, 
  the why;<BR>* <B>outcome</B> refers to unintended consequences, goals achieved 
  beyond, beside,<BR>
  <DD>against the intentions of the agents, the "but".</DD></UL>
<DD>Here I should like to ask the question, with White: which of these 
categories of semantic analysis are emphasized in the respective modes of formal 
argument? The following seems to be the case:<BR>
<UL>
  <DD><B>(a) Formist argument</B> focuses upon unique agents (who), their unique 
  acts (what is going on) and the unique way in which they realize their goals 
  (agencies, how). With emphasis on the unique, there is no concern for 
  regularities, recurrences, no noting of similarities. This is, of course, the 
  weak group/low grid quadrant location. This is where I would put the gospel of 
  Jn. My reasons for doing so will be presented below. Further, any 
  psychological telling of the story of Jesus by modern authors usually belongs 
  here as well.<BR>
  <DD><B>(b) Contextualist argument</B> focuses upon the relationship between 
  act (what is going on) and agency (how does it happen) within a given context 
  (location). Agents, objects and purposes are duly noted, but are subservient 
  to act, agency and location. What is described then is events and their 
  pragmatic effects in terms of some explanation linking act and agency in a 
  given context. These features are typical of weak group/high grid. And this 
  mode of argument is typical of mainstream U.S. society, its newspaper articles 
  and T.V. stories, its historians and novelists.<BR>
  <DD><B>(c) Organicist argument</B> finds context insignificant or illusory. 
  Thus all those who do history of ideas almost automatically resonate with this 
  quadrant. The main focus of organicist argument is the purpose, the why, the 
  unveiling of principles and ideas within historical processes. These 
  principles are perceived to apply inexorably and inevitably since they express 
  the eternal and abiding Truth. This, of course, is the strong group/high grid 
  quadrant. All studies of the life of Jesus that focus on Jesus as teacher, as 
  formulator of truth, or on the Bible as the repository of eternal truth 
  applicable to all cultures and all social systems by a simple or complex study 
  of the "text" fit in this quadrant. By and large, the majority of studies of 
  the life of Jesus coming from W. Germany, England and Canada fall into this 
  category. The strong group/high grid social script is typical of West German, 
  British and Canadian elites (and their audiences?). Hence it comes as no 
  surprise that German and British graduate schools and those U.S. graduate 
  schools staffed by their alumni would favor this mode of argument.<A 
  href="#3">(3)</A><BR>
  <DD><B>(d) Mechanistic argument</B> focuses upon location, act and agency. 
  Historians adopting this mode seek to demonstrate how situations (where) and 
  agencies of an extrahistorical sort control agents in their activities. In the 
  gospels, for example, God, spirits, demons, and angels are the agencies in a 
  specific place and time context and that control events. Extrahistorical 
  forces need not be personified; they may be social structures, untouchable and 
  invisible groups (e.g. conspirators and their conspiracies), or classes 
  impelled by social/historical necessity. This is the mode of argument 
  befitting strong group/low grid. It seems to underlay the Synoptics and Paul 
  as well as most "liberation theology" uses of the life of Jesus. Figure 3 
  lists the features of semantic analysis and the relative modes of formal 
  argument.</DD></UL>
<DD>Now that some examples of comparative interest have been duly categorized, 
one might ask about the value of such an exercise. In the first place, I submit, 
such comparison allows for scholarly distancing. And scholarly distancing allows 
for intelligent and testable comparison. Secondly, this exercise helps 
underscore the truism that authors, past and present, have social locations. 
There is, of course, no immaculate perception. To understand persons from 
cultures other than our own, some such distancing process is necessary, if only 
out of fairness. Furthermore, to get to see who might be our scholarly, 
significant others, such an exercise helps one to determine his/her own social 
location and the implicit presuppositions that working in that location 
yield.<BR>
<DD>After working through the foregoing process, it becomes quite obvious that 
historical works on the strong group side of the model are necessarily 
ethnocentric: they all appeal to a time and place conditioned story and argue 
for its abiding relevance, hence the emphasis on ideas, ideals (high grid); or 
on encouragement, hope for transformation, arguments for change in social 
structure (low grid). On the other hand, the works on the weak group side of the 
model are rather irrelevant: the picture of Jesus they portray either cannot be 
applied in contemporary weak group/high grid society (e.g. the U.S. mainstream: 
Jesus as faith healer or magician would be a deviant there), or the universal, 
polymorphic psychological personage of weak group/low grid remains highly 
idiosyncratic and utopian.<A 
href="#4">(4)</A> If 
historical reconstruction and cross cultural understanding are the focuses of 
concern, then I would argue in favor of the irrelevant picture of weak 
group/high grid provenance. Irrelevant does not mean unimportant; while 
ethnocentric does mean inaccurate. These seem to be our choices at present.<BR>
<DD>To sum up, the historian no less than the gossip, ancient and modern, 
necessarily weaves a set of implicit meanings into an explicit story. As story 
tellers select among events from the historical field (chronicle) they 
necessarily and simultaneously have to make their selections with a view to how 
the elements from the historical field will fit along some time framework 
(story). This selection process inevitably follows along a course set by three 
implicit questions: why did things happen the way that they did (mode of 
emplotment), what is the point of it all (mode of formal argument), and what 
should we—author and audience—do about it (mode of ideological implication). 
These three questions are with the story teller/historian from the very 
beginning of their activity. The questions guide the story telling process, and 
answers to them are inevitably provided in the realization of the story, the 
historian's final product.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>3. The Social Location of John: 
Further Observations</FONT><BR>
<DD>In terms of the foregoing model, Jn is different from the other three 
gospels in that Jn belongs to the weak group/low grid quadrant while the 
Synoptics belong to the strong group/low grid quadrant. In terms of Jn's social 
location as it pertains to story tellers and their stories, Jn would be 
presenting his audience with the story of Jesus (as do Mark, Matthew and Luke), 
but with a romantic tragedy mode of emplotment, developing an implicit formist 
argument, and with an anarchic ideology. This is what figure 3 would have one 
expect. The weak group/low grid configuration in that figure indicates that in 
his story telling, Jn made a selection from among the things that Jesus said and 
did, and that were said and done to Jesus (chronicle), and put these in some 
time sequence (story) in such a way that:<BR>
<DD>(1) Jn's mode of emplotment, the "why and how did it turn out" aspect of the 
story, takes on the features of romantic tragedy. In general this mode of 
emplotment underscores how new forces and new conditions require and demand 
social interruption and step level changes to make life livable since values and 
experiences do not match. The unique, the individual, the particular are what 
count, while universalistic and changeless generalities are useless and 
illusory. The romantic aspect of this plot line focuses on the hero as 
individual, with the individual's heightened sense of self and 
self-identification. Note how in Jn, Jesus repeatedly makes "I am . . . " 
statements underscoring this sense of self and self-identification (Jn 
6:35.41.48.51; 8:12.18; 9:5; 10:7.9.11.14; 11:25; 14:6; 15:1.5), although the 
items with which Jesus identifies himself in Jn's story are items which he 
previously offered to various persons in the narrative. This is a sort of 
metaphorical self-identification pointing to new conditions, new forces and new 
values uniquely bound up with the individual, the unique, i.e. the person of 
Jesus. Further, even from the viewpoint of raw statistics, note how Jn employs 
personal pronouns. For example, "I" (as Greek pronoun) is used 146 times, 
compared with 18 times in Mk, 23 times in Mt and 26 times in Lk (the numbers are 
approximate and probable due to the quality of certain manuscripts). The simple 
"I am" phrases in Jn (4:26; 6:20; 7:36; 8:28.58; 9:9; 13:9; 18:5.6) are 
certainly worth the discussion they receive in most commentaries. The main point 
here, however, is that Jn is indeed concerned about the personal claims and 
individuality of his hero in a way absent from the other gospel stories about 
Jesus. In line with the romantic plot perspective, Jesus transcends the world of 
experience. Indeed the prologue to the gospel (Jn 1:1 ff.) informs the 
reader/hearer of this fact in no uncertain terms. As the story develops, Jesus 
overcomes that world and is exalted above it in the end. In the dramatic 
progression of the story, Jesus moves to overcome evil, the light overcoming 
darkness. As a unique individual, he overcomes the world in which he is 
constrained and enveloped. He breaks the fetters of the social group ("his own") 
and stands out uniquely, alone.<BR>
<DD>The tragedic aspect can be seen in the way Jesus attains his end through 
sets of contests/conflicts of increasing intensity. There are challenges and 
ripostes of the sort common to the Synoptic gospels and Mediterranean culture in 
general (see <A 
href="#1981b">Malina</A> 
1981b: 25-50), only in Jn Jesus' successful ripostes do more than demonstrate 
that Jesus is an honorable teacher and healer. They have evidential value which 
furnishes those who would see with insight into the regularities of human 
existence controlled by God (the Father). In what he says and does in his 
contest against the world, Jesus as Jn's hero, reveals why experience and values 
do not match in the world of human living; humankind is stuck in a sort of 
subhuman, unnatural condition. In his dying on the cross, the ultimate 
humiliation in first century Mediterranean social experience, Jesus is exalted 
and thereby reveals a higher order principle that can endow life with meaning. 
Thus the story of Jesus shows that the conditions under which human beings must 
live in the world are unalterable, hence people must look beyond them for 
liberation, specifically by "believing into" (a phrase typical of Jn) the one 
sent by God, Jesus.<BR>
<DD>(2) Jn's mode of formal argument, "the point of it all" dimension of his 
story, is the formist mode. This mode of argument highlights the uniqueness of 
agents, agencies or means, and acts in the story. Jn presents a range of 
individual types to people his story: e.g. Nathaniel, Andrew, Nicodemus, the 
Samaritan woman, the man born blind, Lazarus, Peter, Thomas, the disciple whom 
Jesus loved. The reader/hearer can almost imagine each of them in terms of 
individualistic personality with its focus on uniqueness. And throughout the 
course of the gospel, Jesus himself stands out as a unique, forceful and 
significant "personality." As most students of the Bible know, these features 
are absent from the Synoptic gospels.<A 
href="#5">(5)</A><BR>
<DD>The formist mode of argument seeks to identify the unique characteristics of 
agents, agencies and acts in the historical field and to assign them to classes 
with general qualities and specific attributes. In the course of his narrative, 
the author of Jn does this to an extensive degree that proves rather distinctive 
for a first century Mediterranean writing. On the other hand, descriptions and 
explanations of the location of the drama, of physical and social dimensions, 
are left on the periphery. Thus what Jn offers the reader/hearer is a 
scattergram of information that highlights individual features. Jn does not 
express or articulate any laws or principles or regularities governing the human 
condition and revealed in the course of human interaction. Rather the attentive 
reader/hearer comes away with vivid and direct insight into agents, agencies and 
acts, set out in an impressionistic way.<BR>
<DD>The Synoptic tradition describes Jesus as refusing to offer signs to anyone. 
Jn, to the contrary, literally overwhelms the reader/hearer with signs, quite in 
line with a focus on the uniqueness of agencies and acts (Jn 2:1-11; 4:46-54; 
5:1-18; 6:1-15; 9:1-41; 11:1-46; 20:1-10; and see 2:18-22 along with 20:17-18; 
20:19-29; also 1:49; 4:16-19; 19:32-37). This series of signs, however, does not 
have the strong group/low grid aim of mobilizing the masses for a revolution, 
since even in Jn Jesus refuses the role of political leader (Jn 6:15). Rather 
Jn's signs are to function in a weak group/low grid context where they are 
intended to give direction to the individual reader/hearer of the story. They 
seek to provoke commitment with the insight that in Jesus the biblical promises 
of God, and not just Deut 18:15 as in the Synoptics, are fulfilled. Hence Jesus' 
unique actions, wrought by God's unique agency, show that Jesus is uniquely "the 
Christ, the Son of God" and that for the individual, commitment based on this 
insight means "eternal life."<BR>
<DD>Jesus's words and deeds display a series of distinctive standards emerging 
and standing over against the general run of customs and laws in vogue in 
society at large. This, in sum, is the mode of formal argument in Jn, a weak 
group/low grid mode.<BR>
<DD>(3) The ideological perspective of a story intimates "what the reader/hearer 
should then do about it." According to Jn this perspective moves the 
reader/hearer to look for humanity's best times in the past, when Jesus, the 
Word of God, "dwelt among us," when "we have beheld his glory" (Jn 1:14). This 
past is not irretrievable, since it can be realized and experienced in all its 
grandeur at any time, if people would only anchor themselves in Jesus, the 
Messiah (i.e. "believe into" Jesus, with commitment and loyalty; this phrase is 
used some 34 times in Jn, only once each in Mk and Mt and not at all in Lk).<A 
href="#6">(6)</A> This 
anchoring in Jesus equally entails the obligation to live one's restored 
fundamental humanity in terms of Jesus' standard of "love." This "love" refers 
to behavior based on mutual care and concern for those in the collectivity who 
have move outside the boundaries of society at large due to allegiance to Jesus 
as Messiah, and thus find themselves in a weak group/low grid social location. 
In this quadrant, the collectivity simply constitutes a social aggregation, and 
certainly not a society (for such aggregations in low grid, see <A 
href="#Sc">Schmidt et 
al.</A> 1977). A society requires some set of various and abiding social 
relations that define social roles. In the group of Jn, there are no sets of 
relations, only a single relation of "love" and a focal legitimate authority, 
the "disciple whom Jesus loved." This disciples replicates the legitimate 
authority of Jesus himself, it would seem (low grid authority is of a 
legitimate, customary sort since only high grid has "law," see <A 
href="#1981a">Malina</A> 
1981a). Consequently group members have only their participant role based on the 
relation of "love" (a form of commitment, like "believing into") with direct and 
immediate access to the God of Israel in Jesus. This social stance clearly 
implies total social transcendence, with rather full disregard for existing 
institutions, notably those from which the weak group/low grid members of the Jn 
group emerged. This aspect of Jn's story clearly indicates that those 
commentators who see Jn's group as recently broken away from (or ejected from) 
existing Jewish institutions are quite correct (e.g. <A 
href="#Br">Brown</A> 1979). 
For the "Johannine community," previous lines defining and delimiting meaningful 
social relations and institutions are largely eradicated. Thus group members 
find themselves beyond ordinary limits, in a situation in which the individual 
can find him/herself in a restored and culturally unadulterated humanity based 
on the realization of the new values that emerged in the uniqueness of Jesus, 
the Messiah. Hence the distance from "the Jews" and "this world," so patently 
marked in the narrative, because the group members' main concern would be to 
share no standards like the rules and customs followed in the grid/group 
quadrant from which they derived.<BR>
<DD>This, in brief, is what Jn's story of Jesus entails in terms of White's 
model of metahistory as superimposed on Douglas' grid/group. The model indicates 
that the reason the author of Jn tells the story in the way he does is not 
because he draws upon the "objective" meaning of the events in the 
pre-existence—life—death—resurrection of Jesus, but because of constraints on 
perception deriving from his social location. Jn writes as he does because that 
is the way people come to perceive and articulate the meaning of Jesus' story 
within a weak group/low grid cultural script in the context of first century 
Jewish core values. The meanings imparted by Jn cohere well with all the 
dimensions of the weak group/low grid social location. While that social 
location does not determine the genius of a person or the exact form that 
his/her work might take, it does determine and define the limits within which an 
author's selection process can take place as well as the general shape of the 
patterns of perception available to persons in the quadrant. These perceptions 
of the author of Jn are realized and articulated in language, and Jn's language, 
likewise, is weak group/low grid.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>4. John and 
Antilanguage</FONT><BR>
<DD>If one could say, as Halliday (<A 
href="#Ha">1978:</A> 171) 
does, that "the early Christian community was an antisociety, and its language 
was in this sense an antilanguage," the statement as it stands would be most 
appropriate for Jn and the group that originally resonated with its story, Jn's 
group. Halliday has sketched the notable characteristics of the phenomenon of 
antilanguage (<A 
href="#ha">Halliday</A> 
1978: 164-182). His description indicates that antilanguage finds its social 
residence among people following weak group/low grid scripts (e.g. individuals 
put into prison, the underworld, adolescents) and forming antisocietal groups. 
Obviously, the description fits Jn quite well. The rest of the New Testament 
writings bespeak a counter-society with a counter-language typical of competing 
groups in strong group/low grid settings. I submit, then, that only Jn reveals 
all the salient traits of an antilanguage.<BR>
<DD>According to Halliday, an antilanguage is a language deriving from and 
generated by an antisocietal group. And an antisocietal group is a social 
collectivity that is set up within a larger society as a conscious alternative 
to it. The reason why persons might come up with a conscious alternative to the 
society in which they are in some way embedded are varied and many, e.g. being 
labelled a deviant, with active hostility by society at large against such 
individuals, lack of social concern for certain individuals, with a resulting 
passive social symbiosis, exile or rejection due to negative outcomes to an 
uprising or revolution, and the like. In terms of the grid/group model, such 
antisocietal groups are weak group/low grid. Since weak group/low grid is a 
transitional social location, even if lasting several hundred years, the 
specific perceptions of persons in this quadrant depend upon their initial 
social location. Thus strong group/low grid initial location results in 
antisociety when individuals are expelled from the strong group for some reason. 
Weak group/high grid initial location results in antisociety when individuals 
experience a collapsing or collapsed grid. In Jn's case, the document points to 
a collectivity that emerged from and stands opposed to strong group/low grid 
society and its competing groups. Concretely, the notable groups which Jn's 
collectivity opposes include "the (this) world" (79 times in Jn; 9 times in Mt 
and 3 each in Mk and Lk), and "the Jews" (71 times in Jn; 5 times in Mt and Lk; 
7 times in Mk). These groups adamantly refuse to believe in Jesus as Messiah. 
Brown (<A 
href="#Br">1979:</A> 
168-169) singles out four more groups: the adherents of John the Baptist who do 
not as yet believe in Jesus, and three groups which claim to believe in Jesus: 
crypto-Christians, Jewish Christians and Christians of the apostolic churches. 
This last group is perhaps "the sheep not of this fold" (Jn 10:16) with which 
Jn's group has some relationship through the "shepherd." Jn's antilanguage is a 
form of resistance to this range of competing groups and develops for positive 
and negative reasons, to be considered shortly.<BR>
<DD>Perhaps the simplest way to discern the presence of antilanguage is to note 
its distinctive development of and penchant for new words in place of old ones. 
Antilanguage is language relexicalized, but only partially. Its implicit 
principle seems to be: same grammar but different vocabulary, though only in 
certain areas. And these areas are those of central concern to the focal 
interests and activities of the antisocietal group. In Jn, this concern is 
articulated as follows: "that you may continue to believe that Jesus is the 
Messiah, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name" (Jn 
20:31). In other words, the author of Jn is concerned with spelling out the 
meaning of Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah and in developing emotional anchorage 
"in Jesus" for his collectivity. It is to this end that the author develops his 
very different vocabulary.<BR>
<DD>Furthermore, it is characteristic of antilanguage not simply to relexicalize 
in its area of concern, but to overlexicalize by employing a rather large range 
of lexical items to cover the same area. This feature is easily demonstrable in 
Jn (see <A 
href="#Ky">Kysar</A> 1976). 
First of all, note his contrasts between "spirit, the above, life, light, not of 
the/this world, freedom, truth, love" and their opposites: "flesh, the below, 
death, darkness, the/this world, slavery, lie, hate." These words are variants 
used to describe contrasting spheres of existence, opposing modes of living and 
being. Similarly, and with extremely little appreciable difference in meaning, 
Jn speaks of "believing into Jesus," or "following" him, of "abiding in" him or 
"loving" him, of "keeping his word," of "receiving" him, or "having" him, or 
"seeing" him. Again, since Jn is antilanguage, and Jn's group in weak group/low 
grid, this is all quite predictable.<BR>
<DD>In his general model of language, Halliday distinguishes three linguistic 
modes of meaning: the ideational, the interpersonal, and the textual. The 
ideational refers to what is being said or described; the interpersonal looks to 
the personal qualities of the communicating partners; and the textual pertains 
to the qualities of any piece of language to form text (e.g. cohesion). Again, 
what one says is ideational, with whom one speaks is interpersonal and how one 
speaks is textual (see <A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 
1978: 8-36; the model on 69 and its explanation on 125-126). These components 
have to be singled out here because it is typical of antilanguage to deemphasize 
the ideational and focus upon the interpersonal and textual alone. For example, 
a comparison of the text of Jn (the whole gospel as story) with the texts of the 
Synoptics will readily indicate that Jn downplays the ideational function of 
language while highlighting the interpersonal and textual functions. The 
linguistic dimensions of how Jesus speaks (textual component) and with whom he 
speaks (interpersonal component), come through in a way not found in the 
Synoptic narratives from strong group/low grid communities. Now, Halliday notes, 
it is these two dimensions (interpersonal and textual) in their antilanguage 
form that account for overlexicalization. For example, overlexicalization based 
on the textual function of language (how Jesus speaks, how others speak to 
Jesus) is revealed in forms of verbal display such as punning and word play. 
This feature is quite apparent in Jn's pattern of ambiguity, misunderstanding 
and clarification (Jn 2:19 ff.; 3:3 ff.; 4:10 ff.; 4:32 ff.; 6:33 ff.; 8:31 ff.; 
8:38 ff.; 11:11 ff.; 11:23 ff.; 13:8 ff.; 14:4 ff.; 14:7 ff.; 14:21 ff.; 16:16 
ff. All of these text-segments reveal verbal display or word plays relative to 
the following: the destruction of the temple, being born again, water, food, 
bread, freedom, father, sleep, resurrection, washing, way, seeing, 
manifestation, a little while—respectively). This feature is likewise manifested 
in Jn's penchant for irony (Jn 2:9-10; 4:12; 7:27; 7:42; 7:52; 11:16; 11:36; 
12:19; 13:37; 18:31; 18:38; 19:5; 19:14; 19:19 ff.).<BR>
<DD>As for the interpersonal component, overlexicalization deriving from this 
function of language (who is involved, of whom and to whom Jesus speaks) is 
indicated by the set of words that have the same denotation, but have quite a 
different connotation based on the attitude and commitment they entail in an 
interpersonal context. This includes, for example, all the "I am . . . " 
statements previously referred to. The words "bread" (Jn 6:35), "light" (8:12), 
"door" (10:9), "life" (11:25-26), "way" (14:6), "vine" (15:5) have the same 
denotation in the contexts in which they are employed; they refer to various, 
real world objects. However when identified with Jesus in an "I am . . . " 
proposition, each takes on some interpersonal dimension. The synonyms for the 
activities of discipleship ("to believe, come, abide, follow, love, keep words, 
receive, have, see") and those for the two contrasting realms ("the above, 
spirit," etc., and "the below, flesh," etc. listed previously) point in the same 
direction, i.e. to the interpersonal component of language.<BR>
<DD>This orientation toward the interpersonal and textual modes of the 
linguistic system accounts for the way social values are foregrounded, 
highlighted, and underscored in antilanguage. After all, weak group/low grid 
collectivities seek the implementation of new values in place of old ones, not 
new structures. New structures in place of old ones form the focus of strong 
group/low grid concerns (e.g. the Synoptics, Paul). Emphasis on new structures 
underscores and features the ideational mode of the linguistic system. What is 
in fact happening and what should in fact be happening are emphasized, while who 
is involved and what is said are of lesser concern.<BR>
<DD>What uses do antilanguages serve? Halliday observes that antilanguages are 
generally replications of social forms based on highly distinctive values that 
are clearly set apart from those of the society from which antisocietal members 
derive. Like language itself, antilanguage is the bearer of social reality, but 
of an alternative social reality that runs counter to the social reality of 
society at large. Thus antilanguage serves to maintain inner solidarity under 
pressure. The pressure, of course, stems from the surrounding broader society 
from which weak group/low grid collectivities stem and in which they are to a 
large extent still embedded. Furthermore, for individuals to maintain solidarity 
with their fellow antisocietal members and not fall back into the margins of the 
groups from which they left or were ejected, some sort of alternative ideology 
along with emotional anchorage in the new collectivity is necessary. This 
necessity is best served by demonstrations of mutual care and concern on the 
part of those in the antisocietal group so as to establish strong affective 
identification on the part of newcomers into the group as well as those on its 
fringes ready to swing out. Of course, this describes the process of 
resocialization (see <A 
href="#Mo">Mol</A> 1976: 
50-54; 142-201). Just as language is crucial to the social construction of 
reality and to the socialization of new members into that reality, so too 
antilanguage is crucial to the social reconstruction of reality and to the 
resocialization of newcomers into that reality. Jn is an instance of such 
antilanguage in the Christian tradition.<BR>
<DD>From the viewpoint of linguistics, the process of resocialization and 
solidarity maintenance makes special demands on the antilanguage. In particular, 
the antilanguage in question must facilitate the process of establishing 
strongly affective ties with both the reputational legitimate authority who is 
the central influence in the collectivity as well as with significant others in 
the group. And this process has to be geared to the individual group member, 
just as the original socialization process was. Now the linguistic genre most 
appropriate to this end is conversation and its implicit modes of reciprocity. 
In Jn again, there is ample evidence of distinctive conversations with Jesus 
that serve a resocialization function (Jn 3:1–4:42; 5:10 ff.; 6:22 ff.; 
9:13–10:42; 11:1-44; 11:45–12:36a; 13–17). How these conversations unfold is 
common knowledge. Jesus begins to converse with some individual person, moves on 
to address that person in monologue fashion, and the monologue turns into an 
address to the reader/hearer. Throughout these text-segments, there is heavy 
foregrounding of interpersonal meanings directed to individuals. It seems that 
these conversations are the feature of Jn that hold constant and perennial 
appeal for persons in weak group settings: Jesus speaks to them in an individual 
way, not as group members as is the case in the rest of the Synoptics (or for 
the addressees of the remaining New Testament writings). It must be emphasized 
that it is Jn's weak group/low grid antilanguage that accounts for this feature 
of the gospel. (In this regard, the use of the pronoun "you" singular in Greek 
is distinctive: 60 times in Jn, 10 times in Mk, 18 in Mt and 26 times in Lk; 
similarly the pronoun "you" plural in Greek: 68 times in Jn, 11 in Mk, 30 in Mt, 
and 28 times in Lk—such emphatic use of the pronoun in Greek simply underscores 
the interpersonal dimension).<BR>
<DD>Halliday notes the importance of a further characteristic of antilanguages, 
namely that a given antilanguage is not simply a specialized variety, a 
technical variety of ordinary language used in a special way or in particular, 
technical contexts (e.g. technical jargons, argots and the like). Rather, an 
antilanguage arises among persons in groups espousing and held by alternative 
perceptions of reality, reality as experienced and set up in opposition to some 
established mode of conception and perception. Consequently, an antilanguage is 
nobody's "mother tongue," nor is it a predictable "mother tongue" derivative. 
Rather antilanguage exists solely in a social context of resocialization. Like 
any other language, it is a means of realizing the cultural script of the group 
in question, a means of expressing perceptions of the reality mediated by that 
script by actively creating and maintaining that reality by means of language. 
But unlike ordinary language, antilanguage creates and expresses a reality that 
is inherently an alternative reality, one that is constructed precisely in order 
to function as an alternative to society at large. In the antilanguage of Jn, it 
is the weak group/low grid variety of a group that emerged from and still lives 
among a strong group/low grid society, the society of first century 
Mediterranean Hellenism in general, and of Judaism in particular. Thus what is 
significant in antilanguage is not its distance from the language of strong 
group/low grid society, but the tension between the two. Both the society at 
large and the antisocietal group share the same overarching system of meaning, 
just as both are part and parcel of the same overarching social system. Yet they 
stand in opposition to and in tension with each other. The reason for 
underscoring this point is that to appreciate the new values and perceptions 
generated by a weak group/low grid, antisocietal collectivity, one must 
understand the larger society to which it stands opposed.<BR>
<DD>The counter-reality generated by weak group/low grid collectivities such as 
the Johannine community has certain implications. First of all, it implies an 
emphasis on new core values and an attempt to create standards and structures to 
implement those values. Then it likewise implies a preoccupation with social 
boundaries, with social definition and defense of identity by means of repeated 
and varied articulation of the new reality now so clearly perceived. Of course 
both of these points are realized in Jn's strong contrast between "the above, 
spirit," etc. and "the below, flesh," etc. and the forms of behavior proper to 
each. Further the counter-reality in question implies a special conception of 
information and knowledge—a feature more than amply highlighted in Jn. Finally 
such counter-reality implies that social meanings will be seen as oppositions; 
values are defined in terms of what they are not. Again, in Jn it is quite clear 
that Jesus' prodigies are simply not about what is going on, i.e. healing or 
rescue, but about something more and something other than one can ostensibly 
witness.<BR>
<DD>As Halliday has observed, the overlexicalization of antilanguages is a form 
of variant in linguistics. In general, a variant is an alternative realization 
of a linguistic element on the next, or some higher level of abstraction in the 
linguistic system. A higher level realization always has the same meaning in 
some respect as the items falling beneath it. For example, the lexical items, 
"fruit," "vegetables," "meat," and "bread" have "food" as their variant. "Food" 
is an alternative realization of a linguistic element such as "bread" or "meat" 
on a higher level in the linguistic system. Similarly, this higher level 
realization, "food," always has the same meaning in some respect as the items 
falling beneath it, in this case, "fruit, vegetables, meat, bread." Thus "fruit" 
can mean "food," "vegetables" can mean "food," "meat" can mean "food," and 
"bread" can mean "food," while the lexical item "food" can be used to mean any 
of the foregoing; they are technically variants of the word, "food." Similarly, 
in Jn "spirit, the above, life, light, not of the/this world, freedom, truth, 
love" are all variants of the "new reality" which Jn identifies with and in 
Jesus of Nazareth. On the contrary, "the flesh, the below, death, darkness, 
this/the world, slavery, lie, hate" are all variants of what Jn and the 
collectivity addressed in the work oppose, the "old reality" of the strong 
group/low grid society from which they came.<BR>
<DD>However the significant thing about the lexical items (words and sentences) 
distinctive of an antilanguage, as Halliday notes, is that many of them have no 
equivalent meanings at all in the standard language of the broader society. 
Sentences such as: "I and the Father (= God) are one" (Jn 10:30); "Truly, truly 
I say to you, before Abraham was, I am (8:58); or the identification of Jesus of 
Nazareth with the pre-existing Word of God become flesh (1:1 ff.) would simply 
be meaningless in the language of the broader society. This does not mean that 
they could not be understood and judged to be meaningless, or that they could 
not be translated (after all, our English versions do them adequate justice). 
Rather, what it does mean is that such propositions do not function as meaning 
bearing language in the semantic system of regular language, even the regular 
"religious" language of contemporary early Christianity and Judaism. It is quite 
significant to note that there are no such sentences in the writings of Paul or 
the other gospels and non-Johannine New Testament documents.<BR>
<DD>The foregoing considerations point to the fact that an antilanguage is a 
metaphor for the regular language of society at large. Metaphorization takes 
place when some common, often implicit, quality proper to one entity is 
predicated of another, e.g. "My brother is a lion." Here the implicit property 
is strength or ferocity; thus the explicit sentence would read: "My brother is 
as strong as/as ferocious as a lion." In antilanguage, such a metaphorical 
quality appears all the way through the system. Halliday tells us that it is 
this metaphorical quality that defines an antilanguage. In Jn, this metaphorical 
quality can be seen in the "I am . . ." statements where Jesus says of himself: 
"I am bread, light, a door, life, way, vine," and the like. The metaphorical 
quality inherent in the list of ambiguity—misunderstanding—clarification 
sequences noted previously also point to the same thing. Metaphor constitutes 
the element of antilanguage that is present in all language to some extent. For 
much of everyday language is in fact metaphorical, e.g. horsepower in an 
automobile, a cell in biology, conceiving ideas. Yet the metaphorical quality of 
everyday language is lost and has come to be identified with regular speech, 
with reality itself. On the other hand, what distinguishes an antilanguage is 
that when it is compared with the existing language system of the culture in 
which it emerges and the society against which it stand, it is itself a 
metaphorical entity. Hence in antilanguage, metaphorical modes of expression are 
the norm. Metaphorical modes of expression are an antilanguage's regular pattern 
of realization.<BR>
<DD>As pointed out previously, the main form of discourse used in socialization 
and in reality maintenance is conversation. The reality generating and 
maintaining power of language lies in conversation. It is cumulative and depends 
for its effectiveness on continuous enforcement in social interaction. In Jn, 
all the great Johannine metaphors emerge in conversations. Their metaphorical 
points are made in conversation, thus maintaining the resocialization quality of 
the work in the reader's/hearer's being addressed by Jesus in these 
conversations as the dialogue becomes monologue. In the resocialization process 
conversation relies heavily upon foregrounding and highlighting interpersonal 
meanings, and the great Johannine conversations surely do that. Finally, 
conversation depends for its power to generate reality on its being casual. In 
Jn, again, Jesus' many and frequent conversations so often point to casual 
encounters with individuals with whom the weak group reader/hearer can empathize 
and thus take on the role of conversation partner as Jesus moves on to monologue 
in the second part of these conversations.<BR>
<DD>A final point Halliday makes is that within the ideational mode of meaning 
(what is being talked about), an antilanguage may adopt linguistic structures 
and lexical collocations that are self-consciously opposed to the norms of 
established language. This is typical of the more intellectual antilanguages. 
Now there is evidence of this feature in Jn, although many such items are 
"translated out" in English versions, e.g. in Jn the verb "to believe" most 
often has the preposition "into"; Jesus refers to his death as "being lifted 
up"; and for Jn seeing is believing throughout the story of Jesus' activity. 
Consequently, the modes of linguistic expression in antilanguage, when seen from 
the standpoint of the established language, appear diffuse, round about and 
metaphorical—and so they are from that angle.<BR>
<DD>But seen on their own terms, they appear direct and forceful, powerful 
manifestations of the linguistic system in the service of the construction of 
reality. It is the reality being constructed and newly maintained that is 
oblique, since it can only be seen as a metaphorical transformation of the 
"true" reality of strong group/low grid society. But the function of an 
antilanguage text with respect to that reality is a reinforcing one, all the 
more direct because it is a reality which needs much reinforcement. It is the 
new reality, the new experience and perceptions, of a weak group/low grid 
collectivity.<BR><BR><FONT size=4>Conclusion</FONT><BR>
<DD>John is, indeed, different from the other gospels. The foregoing 
considerations deriving from sociolinguistics point up precisely why this is the 
case. Further, the metahistorical model superimposed on and outfitted with 
grid/group dimensions equally provides explanation for the distinctive qualities 
of Jn. These models provide the historical interpreter with a set of heuristic 
tools and testable conclusions lacking in the usual intuitive and 
impressionistic approaches to biblical texts. While the sociolinguistic level of 
analysis is simply a first step to understanding the Johannine group by means of 
its shared story, it is an important first step. For it furnishes an explanation 
for the distinctive Johannine ways of describing God and human relations with 
God. This explanation, of course, is rooted in the social behavior of Jn's 
collectivity, used as analogy to explain the God revealed in Jesus. Further, 
this mode of analysis enables the interpreter to come to know and appreciate the 
personages who embodied faith in Jesus in first century, Mediterranean weak 
group/low grid contexts—their willingness to identify Jesus with the divinity of 
Jewish tradition, their self-distancing from their original mooring in strong 
group/low grid Judaism, and their emphatic stance relative to interpersonal 
commitment within their group. And it helps the modern student to discover 
social persons in that difficult yet exhilarating social location, persons who 
made sense of the overarching meaning of human existence "in Jesus" in highly 
creative and significant ways. Finally, such analysis highlights the ever 
present problem of weak group/low grid persons and the group, i.e. the need to 
return to stable society and an articulation of Christianity befitting such 
society. Perhaps the Johannine letters intimate this movement, with the 
beginnings of the dissolution of Jn's antisocietal group.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT size=5>NOTES</CENTER></FONT><BR>
<DD><A name=1><B>1.</B></A> I use the word "text" as it is used in linguistics, 
i..e. "meaningful configurations of language intended to communicate" (<A 
href="#De">De Beaugrande</A> 
1980: 1). A sentence from a biblical text is a text-segment; only rarely can a 
lexical item (sentence or word) be a text, e.g. "Beware of dog." In this usage, 
sentences express complete thoughts and can be understood, but not interpreted. 
Texts, on the other hand, can be both understood and interpreted. Interpretation 
requires some larger frame of reference; texts have these built in as a rule due 
to their "texture" (see <A 
href="#Ha">Halliday</A> 
1978). For a model of reading that explains how squiggles on some surface come 
to communicate, I follow the conclusions of <A 
href="#Sa">Sanford and 
Garrod</A> 1981.<BR><BR>
<DD><A name=2><B>2.</B></A> Some might consider this procedure to be circular. 
However such circular procedure seems normal to human perception: "The question 
of what happens first (perception of an object as a whole or perception of 
salient general features composed to perceive an object as a whole) has been 
much discussed by students of perception. In order to perceive that something 
is, say, a table, it would seem necessary to use information about its location, 
size, and shape, but how is it possible to judge its attributes until we know 
what 'it' is? Which comes first, the attributes or the whole? Experience with 
modern systems for processing information has taught us that such circles need 
not be vicious. Minsky and Papert remark in this connection that it is quite 
common in computer programs—and presumably in thought processes—for two 
different procedures use each other as subprocedures. When the system is forming 
a percept, object-forming procedures can call on shape-recognizing procedures as 
subprocedures; when it pays attention to shape, shape-recognizing procedures can 
call on object-forming procedures as subprocedures. The assumption that one set 
of procedures must in every case precede the other imposes a rigid and 
unnecessary constraint on the complexity of our hypothesis about object 
perception" from <A 
href="#Mi">Miller and 
Johnson-Laird</A> 1976: 46.<BR>
<DD>It bothers some people when a large number of societies covering hundreds 
and at times thousands of years, with multiple and unrelated languages are 
compared so simply in terms of four social locations and story lines. It might 
be of interest to those with such objections to consider Thom's mathematical 
demonstration for the existence of only eight ultimate shapes in four 
dimensions. If human beings can perceive only eight shapes in their limited four 
dimensional perspective, then, as Thom himself suggests, perhaps there can only 
be eight ultimate social structures within the human experiences of humankind 
(see <A href="#Th">Thom</A> 
1969, with applications for the social sciences in <A 
href="#Thom">Thompson</A> 
1979, and more recently in anatomy by <A 
href="#Wa">Warwick and 
Williams</A> 1981: 85-92).<BR><BR>
<DD><A name=3><B>3.</B></A> The fact that a goodly number of U.S. scholars in 
the humanities favor this mode is indicative of the pervading German and British 
influence upon U.S. scholarship and its gatekeepers, including publishers (see 
<A href="#Hy">Hynes</A> 
1981: 87-114 for biblical scholarship; and on typically U.S. values and 
experience, see <A 
href="#Wi">Williams</A> 
1970).<BR><BR>
<DD><A name=4><B>4.</B></A> The weak group/low grid social location of Jn, I 
believe, explains the role of Jn's gospel in nearly every enthusiastic movement 
in this history of Christianity; Kung 1967: 191-203 offers a painless overview. 
Further it equally explains the great popularity of Jn in the individualistic 
U.S. Aside from banners at national, professional football games and roadside 
billboards, the gospel of Jn has figured prominently in the national, saturation 
T.V. advertising for free copies of the booklet, Power for Living, by Jamie 
Buckingham, commissioned by the Arthur S. DeMoss Foundation to celebrate the 
civil religion's year of the bible (1983). Jn figures quite prominently in that 
book, and the mailing features an enclosed pamphlet containing only Jn in 
paraphrase. Apart from Jn, the New Testament makes few points for individualism 
and individualistic religion.<BR><BR>
<DD><A name=5><B>5.</B></A> Weak group is the individualism dimension of the 
group axis. Jn is the only N.T. writing in the weak group quadrant, hence a 
writing with resonance for individuals. However further specification of types 
of individualism seems necessary, given the fact that in one sense every human 
being is an individual. To begin with the U.S. case, I have noted elsewhere that 
"Clifford Geertz has observed that our conception of the individual as " . . . a 
bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a 
dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment and action organized into a 
distinctive whole and set contrastively both against other such wholes and 
against its social and natural background, is, however incorrigible it may seem 
to us, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world's cultures" (<A 
href="#1981b">Malina</A> 
1981b: 54; citing <A 
href="#Ge">Geertz</A> 1976: 
225; the U.S. mainstream is characterized by "institutional" individualism. In 
strong group/high grid, only persons occupying peak positions in hierarchies are 
expected to be such institutional individuals; the rest of such societies 
feature dyadic personality. Hence I would call strong group/high grid 
individualism "hierarchic" individualism. Strong group/low grid, on the other 
hand, consists of individuals without hierarchic location, "networking" 
individuals or "prescribed" individuals. Finally in weak group/low grid, persons 
find themselves in antisocietal limbo, in liminal communitas, hence as 
"generalized" individuals. In Jn, this generalized individualism finds its 
expression in Jesus as simply "the <I>anthropos</I>," as in Jn 19:5; see further 
<A href="#1979a">Malina</A>
