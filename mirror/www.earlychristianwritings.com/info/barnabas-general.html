<H1>THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF BARNABAS</H1>
<P>

<B>CHAPTER 1</B><BR>
<I>Preface to the Epistle</I><P>

<B>1.  All happiness in peace to you my sons and daughters, in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who loved us.<BR>


2.  Having perceived abundance of knowledge of the great and
excellent laws of God to be in you, I exceedingly rejoice in your
blessed and admirable souls, because you have so worthily
received the grace which was grafted in you.</B><P>



Early Christians were fond of the horticultural or
     agricultural analogy of grafting one living thing
     permanently into another.  Compare with: "...receive
     with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save
     your souls." (James 1:21)<P>

<B>3.  For which cause I am full of joy, hoping with more
reason to be saved; inasmuch as I truly see a spirit infused into
you from the pure fountain of God:<BR>


4.  Having this persuasion, and being fully convinced of it,
because that since I began to speak unto you, I have had a more
than ordinary good success in the way of the law of the Lord
which is in Christ.</B><P>



"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed
     Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of
     consolation), a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus"
     (Acts 4:36) is highly spoken of in the New Testament. 
     He is characterized as sympathetic and generous (Acts
     4:37), broadminded, for he brought to the Apostles the
     newly-converted Paul, still dazzled by his vision on
     the road to Damascus (Acts 9:26, 27).  Barnabas was
     filled with the Spirit, had the gift of exhortation,
     and was an inspiring influence (Acts 11:23-26); he was
     trustworthy, suited for missionary work and suffered
     persecution with Paul (Acts 11:29, 30, 13:2, 50).<P>



He and Paul worked harmoniously until they
     disagreed over a co-worker, but they resolved their
     differences when Paul chose Silas and Barnabas chose
     Mark, and each went to preach in different areas (Acts
     15:36-41)<P>



They again collaborated (Galatians 2:1), but when
     Peter, for fear of being reproached by Jewish
     Christians, separated himself from James for eating
     with Gentiles (Galatians 2:19-13), Paul rebuked Peter
     to his face "because he was to be blamed" and
     complained that even "Barnabas also was carried away
     with their dissimulation."  (In Colossians 4:10, Paul
     mentions he was imprisoned with Barnabas' nephew, and
     in 1 Corinthians 9:6 he affirms that neither he nor
     Barnabas lived off donations, but were self-
     supporting.)<P>



Because he and Paul had "hazarded their lives for
     the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 15:26),
     Barnabas indeed had the credentials to command respect
     and the authority to write this Epistle.<P>

<B>5.  For which cause, brethren, I also truly think that I
love you above my own soul; because in that dwells the greatness
of faith and charity, as also the hope of that life which is to
come.<BR>


6.  Considering that if I shall take care to communicate to
you a part of what I have received, it will turn to my reward,
that I have served such good souls; I gave diligence to write in
a few words to you, that together with your faith, knowledge also
may be perfect.<BR>


7.  There are therefore three things ordained by the Lord;
the hope of life; the beginning and the completion of it.<BR>


8.  For the Lord has both declared to us by the prophets
those things that are past, and opened to us the beginnings of
those that are to come.<BR>


9.  Wherefore, it will be incumbent on us, as he has spoken,
to come more holily, and nearer to his altar.</B><P>



Although a heavenly altar is mentioned in
     Revelation 6:9, 8:3, 9:13, and 14:18, it is clear from
     the context and other citations that Barnabas refers to
     the church altar where the Eucharist is celebrated. 
     Christ's teaching on that is recorded by Paul in 1
     Corinthians 11:23-34.<P>



Compare with: "We have an altar, whereof they have
     no right to eat which serve the tabernacle." (Hebrews
     13:10)<P>



In the Old Testament, priests were given part of
     most sacrifices for food, but lay people had no right
     to eat this food.  Under the New Covenant, all
     Christians may eat the food of the altar.<P>

<B>10.  I therefore, not as a teacher, but as one of you, will
endeavor to lay before you a few things by which you may, on many
accounts, become more joyful.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 2</B><BR>
<I>That God has abolished the legal sacrifices to introduce the
spiritual righteousness of the Gospel.</I><P>

<B>1.  Seeing then the days are exceeding evil, and the
adversary has got the power of this present world, we ought to
give all the more diligence to inquire into the righteous
judgments of the Lord.<BR>


2.  Now the assistants of our faith are fear and patience;
our fellow-combatants are long-suffering and continence.<BR>


3.  While these remain pure in what relates to the Lord,
wisdom, and understanding, and science, and knowledge, rejoice
together with them.<BR>


4.  For God has manifested to us by all the prophets, that
he has no occasion for our sacrifices, or burnt-offerings, or
oblations, saying thus: To what purpose is the multitude of your
sacrifices to me, says the Lord.<BR>


5.  I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of
fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of he-
goats.</B><P>



The "fed beasts" refer to lambs.<P>

<B>6.  When you come to appear before me, who has required this
at your hands?  You will no more tread my courts.<BR>


7.  Bring no more vain oblations, incense is an abomination
to me; your new moons and sabbaths and the calling of assemblies
I cannot put up with, it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting;
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates.</B><P>



See Isaiah 1:11-14.  Note that without modern
     Bible concordances and other study aids, by allusion
     and verbatim quotations these early Christian writers
     show their comprehensive knowledge of the Scriptures.<P>

<B>8.  These things therefore God has abolished, that the new
law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of any
such necessity, might have the spiritual offering of men
themselves.<BR>

9.  For so the Lord again said to these before: Did I at all
command your fathers when they came out of the land of Egypt
concerning burnt-offerings of sacrifices?</B><P>



See Jeremiah 7:22, 23.<P>

<B>10.  But this I commanded them, saying, Let none of you
imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no
false oath.</B><P>




See Zechariah 8:17.<P>

<B>11.  Because then as we are not without understanding, we
ought to apprehend the design of our merciful Father.  For he
speaks to us, being willing that we who have been in the same
error about the sacrifices should seek and find how to approach
to him.<BR>


12.  And therefore he speaks to us, The sacrifice of God is
a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart God will not
despise.</B><P>

See Psalm 51:17.<P>

<B>13.  Therefore, brethren, we ought all the more diligently
to inquire after those things that belong to our salvation, so
the adversary may not have any entrance into us and deprive us of
our spiritual life.<BR>


14.  Therefore he again speaks to them concerning these
things: You will not fast as you do this day, to make your voice
to be heard on high.<BR>


15.  Is it such a fast that I have chosen?  A day for a man
to afflict his soul?  Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush,
and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?  Will you call this
a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?<BR>


16.  But to us he says in this manner, Is not this the fast
that I have chosen, to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the
heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break
every yoke?<BR>


17.  Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that
you bring the poor that are cast out to your house?  When you see
the naked that you cover him, and that you hide not yourself from
your own flesh.<BR>


18.  Then will your light break forth as the morning, and
your health will spring forth speedily; your righteousness will
go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your reward.<BR>


19.  Then you will call and the Lord will answer; you will
cry and he will say, Here I am.  If you put away from the midst
of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking
vanity; if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
afflicted soul.</B><P>



For verses 14-19, see Isaiah 58:4-10.<P>

<B>20.  In this therefore, brethren, God has evidenced his
foreknowledge and love for us, because the people which he has 
purchased to his beloved Son were to believe in sincerity; and
therefore he has shown these things to all of us, that we should
not run as proselytes to the Jewish law.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 3</B><BR>
<I>The prophecies of Daniel concerning the ten kings, and the coming
of Christ.</I><P>

<B>1.  So it is necessary that searching diligently into those
things which are near to come to pass, we should write to you
what may serve to keep you whole.<BR>


2.  For which purpose let us flee from every evil work and
hate the errors of the present time, that we may be happy in that
which is to come:<BR>


3.  Let us not give ourselves the liberty of disputing with
the wicked and sinners, for fear that in time we possibly should
become like them.<BR>


4.  For the consummation of sin is to come, as the prophet
Daniel says.  And for this end the Lord has shortened the times
and the days, that his beloved might hasten his coming to his
inheritance.</B><P>



See Matthew 24:15-23.<P>

<B>5.  For so the prophet speaks, There will ten kings reign in
the heart, and there will rise last of all another little one,
and he will humble three kings.</B><P>



See Daniel 7:24.  Apocalyptic passages such as
     these in Daniel, like those in Revelation, defy
     definitive interpretation.  Whether they foretell near
     or distant future events, whether those are historical
     or spiritual, whether a historical reference is
     symbolic of another historical event or a spiritual
     one, etc., foments endless debates.  Barnabas may
     interpret all apocalyptic prophecies as spiritual
     analogies, for he says the ten kings will "reign in the
     heart," misquoting Daniel.<P>

<B>6.  And again Daniel speaks in a similar manner concerning
the kingdoms: And I saw the fourth beast dreadful and terrible,
and exceedingly strong; and it had ten horns.  I considered the
horns, and behold there came up among them another little horn,
before which were three of the first horns plucked up by the
roots.</B><P>



See Daniel 7:7, 8.  Some commentators think the
     "little horn" was Antiochus Epiphanes, who destroyed
     the Temple in A.D. 70.  Others believe it may have a
     dual meaning, a future spiritual as well as a past
     historical fulfillment.<P>

<B>7.  We ought therefore to understand this also, so I beseech
you as one of your own brethren, loving you all beyond my own
life, that you look well to yourselves and not be like those who
add sin to sin, and say that their covenant is ours also.  No,
but it is ours only, for they have forever lost that which Moses
received.<BR>


8.  For thus says the Scripture: And Moses continued fasting
forty days and forty nights in the mount; and he received the
covenant from the Lord, even the two tables of stone, written by
the hand of God.<BR>


9.  But having turned themselves to idols, they lost it; as
the Lord also said to Moses, Moses, go down quickly, for your
people, whom you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted
themselves, and turned aside from the way which I commanded them. 
And Moses cast the two tables out of his hands, and their
covenant was broken so the love of Jesus might be sealed in your
hearts, to the hope of his faith.</B><P>


For the story of Moses breaking the two stone
     tablets, see Exodus 32:19 and Deuteronomy 9:11-17.<P>

<B>10.  Therefore let us give heed to the last times.  For all
the time past of our life, and our faith, will profit us nothing
unless we continue to hate what is evil and to withstand the
future temptations.  So the Son of God tells us, Let us resist
all iniquity and hate it.<BR>


11.  Consider the works of the evil way.  Do not withdraw
yourselves from others as if you were already justified, but
coming all together into one place, inquire what is agreeable to
and profitable for the beloved of God.  For the Scripture says,
Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their
own sight.</B><P>


The first reference is paraphrased, the second
     verbatim.  Compare with: "Not forsaking the assembling
     of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is; but
     exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye
     see the day approaching." (Hebrews 10:25); "Woe unto
     [them that are] wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
     their own sight!" (Isaiah 5:21)<P>

<B>12.  Let us become spiritual, a perfect temple to God.  As
much as we can, let us meditate upon the fear of God and strive
to the utmost of our power to keep his commandments, so that we
may rejoice in his righteous judgments.</B><P>



Compare with: "Know ye not that ye are the temple
     of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
     (1 Corinthians 3:16)<P>

<B>13.  For God will judge the world without respect of
persons, and every one will receive according to his works.</B><P>



Compare with: "And I saw the dead, small and
     great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and
     another book was opened, which is [the book of] life:
     and the dead were judged out of those things which were
     written in the books, according to their works.  And
     the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death
     and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and
     they were judged every man according to their works."
     (Revelation 20:12, 13)<P>

<B>14.  If a man will be good, his righteousness will go before
him; if wicked, the reward of his wickedness will follow him.</B><P>



Compare the following: "Behold, the Lord God will
     come with strong [hand], and his arm shall rule for
     him: behold, his reward [is] with him, and his work
     before him." (Isaiah 40:10); "Behold, the Lord hath
     proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the
     daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold,
     his reward [is] with him, and his work before him."
     (Isaiah 62:11); "And, behold, I come quickly; and my
     reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his
     work shall be." (Revelation 22:12)<P>



"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [is]
     your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the
     prophets which were before you." (Matthew 5:12; see
     also Luke 6:23); "But love ye your enemies, and do
     good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your
     reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of
     the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and
     [to] the evil." (Luke 6:35); Hypocrites now have their
     reward (Matthew 6:1-5)<P>



"He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a
     prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that
     receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous
     man shall receive a righteous man's reward.  And
     whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
     ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a
     disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise
     lose his reward." (Matthew 10:41, 42); "For whosoever
     shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
     because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he
     shall not lose his reward." (Mark 9:41)<P>



And regarding the ministry: "... every man shall
     receive his own reward according to his own labour." (1
     Corinthians 3:8)<P>

<B>15.  Take heed therefore for fear that sitting still, now
that we are called, we fall asleep in our sins and the wicked one
get dominion over us, stir us up, and shut us out of the kingdom
of the Lord.</B><P>



This is probably a reference to the parable of the
     ten virgins in Matthew 25:7-13, specifically verse 10.<P>

<B>16.  Consider this also: although you have seen such great
signs and wonders done among the people of the Jews, yet despite
this the Lord has forsaken them.<BR>


17.  Beware therefore, for fear that it happen to us as it
is written, There may be many called, but few chosen.</B><P>


See Matthew 22:14.<P>

<B>CHAPTER 4</B><BR>

<I>That Christ was to suffer is proved from the prophecies
concerning him.</I><P>



<B>1.  For this cause did our Lord condescend to give up his
body to destruction, that through the forgiveness of our sins we
might be sanctified; that is, by the sprinkling of his blood.</B><P>



Ritual blood sprinkling of animal sacrifices in
     the Old Testament prefigured the sacrifice of Christ on
     the cross.  Compare with: "And to Jesus the mediator of
     the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that
     speaketh better things than [that of] Abel." (Hebrews
     12:24; see also Hebrews 10:19, 22); "Elect according to
     the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
     sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
     sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ..." (1 Peter
     1:2)<P>

<B>2.  Now for what concerns the things that are written about
him, some belong to the people of the Jews, and some to us.<BR>


3.  For the Scripture says: He was wounded for our
transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, and by his
blood we are healed.  He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and
as a sheep before his shearers is mute, so he opened not his
mouth.</B><P>



See Isaiah 53:5, 7.<P>

<B>4.  Considering this, we ought to give thanks to God even
more, because he has both declared to us what is passed, and not
allowed us to be without understanding of those things that are
to come.<BR>


5.  But to them he says, The nets are not unjustly spread
for the birds.</B><P>



Compare with: "Surely in vain the net is spread in
     the sight of any bird." (Proverbs 1:17); "Deliver
     thyself... as a bird from the hand of the fowler."
     (Proverbs 6:5); "Surely he shall deliver thee from the
     snare of the fowler..." (Psalm 91:3); "Our soul is
     escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the
     snare is broken, and we are escaped." (Psalm 124:7)<P>

<B>6.  This he spoke, because a man will justly perish if,
having the knowledge of the way of truth, he will nevertheless
not refrain himself from the way of darkness.<BR>


7.  Because of this the Lord was content to suffer for our
souls, although he is the Lord of the whole earth, to whom God
said before the beginning of the world, Let us make man after our
own image and likeness.</B><P>



See Genesis 1:26.<P>

<B>8.  Now how he suffered for us, seeing it was by men that he
underwent it, I will show you.<BR>


9.  The prophets, having received from him the gift of
prophecy, spoke before concerning him:</B><P>



Compare with: "God, who at sundry times and in
     divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by
     the prophets." (Hebrews 1:1); "Searching what, or what
     manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them
     did signify, when it testified beforehand the
     sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
     follow." (1 Peter 1:11); "For the prophecy came not in
     old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake
     [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost." (2 Peter
     1:21)<P>

<B>10.  But he, that he might abolish death and make known the
resurrection from the dead, was content, as was necessary, to
appear in the flesh, that he might make good the promise given
before to our fathers, and preparing himself a new people, might
demonstrate to them while he was upon earth, that after the
resurrection he would judge the world.<BR>


11.  And finally teaching the people of Israel and doing
many wonders and signs among them, he preached to them and showed
the exceeding great love which he had toward them.<BR>


12.  And when he chose his Apostles who were afterwards to
publish his Gospel, he took men who had been very great sinners;
that he might plainly show that he came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.</B><P>



See Matthew 9:13.<P>

<B>13.  Then he clearly demonstrated himself to be the Son of
God.  For had he not come in the flesh, how could men have been
able to look upon him so that they might be saved?<BR>


14.  Seeing if they beheld only the sun, which was the work
of his hands, and will hereafter cease to be, they are not able
to endure steadfastly to look against the rays of it.<BR>


15.  Therefore the Son of God came in the flesh for this
cause, that he might fill up the measure of their iniquity, who
have persecuted his prophets to death.  And for the same reason
also he suffered.<BR>


16.  For God has said of the lash-marks on his flesh, that
they were from them [namely, from the Jews].  And, I will smite
the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</B><P>



See Zechariah 13:7.<P>

<B>17.  Thus he would suffer, because it was incumbent on him
to suffer upon the cross.<BR>


18.  For thus one says, prophesying concerning him: Spare my
soul from the sword.  And again, Pierce my flesh from your fear.</B><P>



The source of the first quote is Psalm 22:20; the
     second is unknown.<P>

<B>19.  And again, the congregation of wicked doers rose up
against me, (They have pierced my hands and my feet).</B><P>



These words in parentheses are from Psalm 22:16
     (see also Zechariah 12:10) and were doubtless cited
     thus by Barnabas, because without them, those foregoing
     do not prove the crucifixion of Christ.  But through
     the repetition of the same proposition, this latter
     part was so early omitted that it was not in the Latin
     interpreter's copy.<P>

<B>20.  And again he says, I gave my back to the smiters, and
my face I set as a hard rock.</B><P>



Compare with: "I gave my back to the smiters, and
     my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not
     my face from shame and spitting." (Isaiah 50:6)<P>

<B>CHAPTER 5</B><BR>
<I>The subject continued.</I><P>

<B>1.  And what did he say when he had fulfilled the
commandment of God?  Who will contend with me?  Let him stand
against me, or who is he that will implore me?  Let him draw near
to the servant of the Lord.  Woe be to you!  Because you will all
become old as a garment, the moth will eat you up.</B><P>



See Isaiah 50:8, 9.<P>

<B>2.  And again the prophet adds, He is put for a stone for
stumbling.  Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a precious
stone, a choice cornerstone; an honorable stone.  And what
follows?  And he that hopes in him will live forever.</B><P>




Compare with: "And he shall be for a sanctuary;
     but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence
     to both the houses of Israel..." (Isaiah 8:14);<P>



"... Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a
     stone, a tried stone, a precious corner [stone], a sure
     foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste."
     (Isaiah 28:19); the Septuagint version of this verse
     reads: "Behold, I lay for the foundations of Sion a
     costly stone, a choice, a corner-stone, a precious
     [stone] for its foundations; and he that believes [on
     him] shall by no means be ashamed."<P>



"But Israel, which followed after the law of
     righteousness, hath not attained to the law of
     righteousness.  Wherefore?  Because [they sought it]
     not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. 
     For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  As it is
     written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and
     rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall
     not be ashamed." (Romans 9:31-33);<P>



"Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture,
     Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect,
     precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be
     confounded.  Unto you therefore which believe [he is]
     precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone
     which the builders disallowed, the same is made the
     head of the corner, And a stone of stumbling, and a
     rock of offence, [even to them] which stumble at the
     word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were
     appointed." (I Peter 2:6-8)<P>

<B>3.  What then?  Is our hope built upon a stone?  God forbid. 
But because the Lord has strengthened his flesh against
sufferings, he says, I have put me as a firm rock.</B><P>



Isaiah 50:7 reads "I have set my face like a
     flint..."<P>

<B>4.  And again the prophet adds, The stone which the builders
refused has become the head of the corner.  And again he says,
This is the great and wonderful day which the Lord has made.  I
write these things the more plainly to you that you may
understand; for indeed I could be content even to die for your
sakes.</B><P>



Compare with: "The stone [which] the builders
     refused is become the head [stone] of the corner.  This
     is the Lord's doing; it [is] marvelous in our eyes. 
     This [is] the day [which] the Lord hath made; we will
     rejoice and be glad in it." (Psalm 118:22-24)<P>

<B>5.  But what says the prophet again?  The counsel of the
wicked surrounded me.  They came about me, as bees about the
honey-comb.  And, Upon my vesture they cast lots.</B><P>



See Psalm 22:16, Psalm 118:12, and Psalm 22:18.
          (The scriptures originally were not divided into
     chapters and verses, so obviously early Christians like
     Barnabas could not cite chapter-and-verse but relied on
     memory and sometimes quoted sources out of order.)<P>

<B>6.  Because our Savior was to appear in the flesh and
suffer, his passion was foretold by this.<BR>


7.  For thus says the prophet against Israel: Woe be to
their soul, because they have taken wicked counsel against
themselves, saying, let us lay snares for the righteous, because
he is unprofitable to us.</B><P>



This quote is Isaiah 3:10 as it appears in the
     Septuagint: "Woe to their soul, for they have devised
     an evil counsel against themselves, saying against
     themselves, Let us bind the just, for he is burdensome
     to us..."<P>

<B>8.  Moses likewise speaks to them: Behold, the Lord God
says, Enter into the good land that the Lord promised to Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it you and possess it; a
land flowing with milk and honey.</B><P>

See Exodus 33:1-3.<P>

<B>9.  Now learn what the spiritual meaning of this is: It is
as if it had been said, Put your trust in Jesus, who will be
manifested to you in the flesh.  Man is the suffering earth, for
out of the substance of the earth Adam was formed.</B><P>



Barnabas is devout and thoughtful, and although
     sometimes his interpretations may seem a stretch, his
     attitude toward the Old Testament is typical also of
     the early Church Fathers, whose acceptance of the
     divine inspiration of the Hebrew canon was approached
     mystically in a firm faith that the ancient records
     held hidden hints of the new covenant, for the new
     fulfilled the old.  Everything in God's old covenant
     with Israel was an allegory or an analogy of what was
     manifested in the new covenant of God with the Church.<P>



They took seriously the words attributed to
     Solomon: "The thing that hath been, it [is that] which
     shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall
     be done: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun. 
     Is there [any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this
     [is] new?  It hath been already of old time, which was
     before us." (Ecclesiastes 1:9, 10)<P>

<B>10.  What therefore does he mean when he says, Into a good
land flowing with milk and honey?  Blessed be our Lord, who has
given us wisdom, and a heart to understand his secrets.  For so
says the prophet, Who will understand the difficult sayings of
the Lord?  He that is wise, and intelligent, and loves his Lord.</B><P>



Compare with: "Who [is] wise, and he shall
     understand these [things]? prudent, and he shall know
     them? for the ways of the Lord [are] right, and the
     just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall
     fall therein." (Hosea 14:9); "A wise [man] will hear,
     and will increase learning; and a man of understanding
     shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a
     proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise,
     and their dark sayings." (Proverbs 1:5, 6)<P>

<B>11.  Seeing that he has renewed us by the remission of our
sins, he has made us another form so that we should have souls
like those of children, forming us again himself by the Spirit.<BR>


12.  For thus the Scripture says concerning us, where it
introduces the Father speaking to the Son; Let us make man after
our likeness and similitude; and let them have dominion over the
beasts of the earth, and over the fowls of the air, and the fish
of the sea.<BR>


13.  And when the Lord saw the man he had formed, and that
he was very good, he said, Increase and multiply, and replenish
the earth.  And this he spoke to his son.</B><P>



See Genesis 1:26-28.  Compare with: "In the
     beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
     the Word was God.  The same was in the beginning with
     God.  All things were made by him; and without him was
     not any thing made that was made.... And the Word was
     made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his
     glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
     Father,) full of grace and truth." (John 1:1, 2, 14)<P>

<B>14.  I will now show you how he made us a new creature in
the latter days.</B><P>



Both the Church and the individual Christian are
     called a new man or a new creature (or a second
     formation); compare with: "Therefore if any man [be] in
     Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed
     away; behold, all things are become new." (2
     Corinthians 5:17); for Jew and Gentile alike: "For in
     Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
     nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." (Galatians
     6:15); "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity,
     [even] the law of commandments [contained] in
     ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new
     man, [so] making peace." (Ephesians 2:15); "And that ye
     put on the new man, which after God is created in
     righteousness and true holiness." (Colossians 3:10)<P>

<B>15.  The Lord says, Behold I will make the last as the
first.  Wherefore the prophet thus spoke, Enter the land flowing
with milk and honey, and have dominion over it.<BR>


16.  So you see how we are again formed anew.  He also
speaks by another prophet, Behold says the Lord, I will take from
them, that is, from those whom the spirit of the Lord foresaw,
their hearts of stone, and I will put into them hearts of flesh.</B><P>



Compare with: "And I will give them one heart, and
     I will put a new spirit within you: and I will take the
     stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a
     heart of flesh." (Ezekiel 11:19)<P>

<B>17.  Because he was going to be made manifest in the flesh
and to dwell in us.<BR>


18.  For, my brethren, the habitation of our heart is a holy
temple to the Lord.  For the Lord says again, In what place shall
I appear before the Lord my God, and be glorified?</B><P>



Compare with: "Know ye not that ye are the temple
     of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
     (1 Corinthians 3:16); the source for "In what place..."
     is unclear.<P>

<B>19.  He answers, I will acknowledge you in the congregation
in the midst of my brethren and sing to you in the church of the
saints.</B><P>



Compare with the following: "I will declare thy
     name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation
     will I praise thee.... I will give thee thanks in the
     great congregation: I will praise thee among much
     people.... Praise ye the Lord.  Sing unto the Lord a
     new song, [and] his praise in the congregation of
     saints." (Psalms 22:22; 35:18; 149:1)<P>

<B>20.  So we are they whom he has brought into that good land.<BR>


21.  But what does the milk and honey signify?  Because as
the child is nourished first with milk, and then with honey; so
we being kept alive by the belief of his promises, and his word,
shall live and have dominion over the land.<BR>


22.  For he foretold above, saying, Increase and multiply,
and have dominion over the fishes, and so forth.<BR>


23.  But who is there that is now able to have this dominion
over the wild beasts, or fishes, or fowls of the air?  For you
know that to rule is to have power, for a man should be set over
what he rules.<BR>


24.  But because we have not this now, he tells us when we
shall have it; namely, when we shall become perfect, that we may
be made the inheritors of the covenant of the Lord.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 6</B><BR>
<I>The scape-goat an evident type of this.</I><P>

<B>1.  Understand then, my beloved children, that the good God
has before made clear all things to us, that we might know to
whom we ought always to give thanks and praise.<BR>


2.  If therefore the Son of God, who is the Lord of all and
will come to judge both the living and the dead, has suffered so
that by the lash-marks he received we might live, let us believe
that except for us, the Son of God would not have suffered.  But
while being crucified, they gave him vinegar and gall to drink.<BR>


3.  Hear therefore how the priests of the temple foreshowed
this also: the Lord declared by his written command that whoever
did not fast the appointed fast should die the death, because he
also was himself one day to offer up his body for our sins; so
that the type of what was done in Isaac, who was offered upon the
altar, might be fulfilled.</B><P>



Hebrews 9 deals with how the Jewish priests and
     temple foreshadowed (Barnabas says foreshowed) the
     deeds of Christ.  The penalty of death for those who
     did not keep the fast on the Day of Atonement is found
     in Leviticus 23:39.  The story of Abraham offering his
     son Isaac as a sacrifice is in Genesis 22.<P>



Barnabas calls this latter example a "type," which
     differs from allegory.  "Typology" is an integral part
     of Christian interpretation of the Old Testament.<P>



St. Augustine, who wrote extensively on allegory
     as a method of interpretation, said: "There are several
     species of this kind of trope that is called allegory,
     and one of them is that which is called enigma.  Now
     the definition of the generic term must necessarily
     embrace also all its species; and hence, as every horse
     is an animal, but not every animal is a horse, so every
     enigma is an allegory, but every allegory is not an
     enigma.  What then is an allegory, but a trope wherein
     one thing is understood from another."<P>



An allegorical interpretation hunts for "the
     hidden meaning" of Scripture behind the actual words. 
     Typology, however, is not an interpretation of the
     words but of the events.  Thus, types are historical in
     nature (particular words are not examined at all) and
     the types depend upon correlation or correspondence. 
     Not all Old Testament occurrences can be said to be
     types, for not all have parallels in the New.  However,
     in the New Testament writings themselves we are given
     certain Old Testament incidents which are "types" of
     the key events in the New.<P>



Although St. Paul says "to speak allegorically" in
     Galatians 4:24-5:1, he is really speaking of types. 
     St. John Chrysostom wrote: "Contrary to usage he calls
     a type an allegory.  His meaning, however, is as
     follows: this history not only declares that which
     appears on the face of it but tells of something to
     happen later.  Therefore, it is called an allegory. 
     And what is foretold?  No less than all the things now
     present."<P>



After taking Paul's examples as a "type,"
     Chrysostom explained: "Thus the type of Jerusalem below
     was Hagar, as is plain from the mountain being so
     called -- but that which is above is the Church. 
     Nevertheless he is not content with these types, but
     adds the testimony of Isaiah to what he has spoken. 
     Having said that Jerusalem which is above 'is our
     mother,' and having given that name to the Church, he
     cites the words of the prophet in his favor."<P>



This is not the only use of "types" (called
     "figures") by St. Paul.  In Romans 5:14 he writes:
     "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even
     over them that had not sinned after the similitude of
     Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was
     to come."  We can recognize, in a passage in which
     foreshadowings of the Eucharist are also connected with
     Israel in the wilderness (I Corinthians 10:1-6), the
     use of typology in his seeing baptism in the crossing
     of the Red Sea by Israel.<P>



Christ himself pointed to Jonah as a symbol (type)
     of his Resurrection (Matthew 12:39-41).  Also, the
     writer of Hebrews (chapter 7) points to Melchizadek as
     a foreshadowing of Christ.<P>



All this means that the Church is not assigning a
     new meaning to the prophetic texts, for the meaning was
     always there, even though it could not be discerned. 
     For when the Church saw Moses, as the giver of the Law
     foreshadowing Christ, or recognized the Suffering
     Servant in Isaiah 42 as a prefiguring of Christ
     crucified, she was not simply making an application of
     an Old Testament vision to a New Testament event.  What
     she saw was the meaning of the Old Testament passage, a
     meaning which could only have been discerned after the
     coming of Christ.  Isaiah's vision of the Servant of
     the Lord is now seen as a historical fact, for Christ
     has come and fulfilled the vision.<P>

This does not imply that the typology used by
     writers and teachers in the Church has always perfectly
     represented these truths.  Even anciently there was
     some slippage from typology into allegory and allegory
     found its way into homilies and devotional teachings. 
     But in the catechetical teachings, dogma, the creeds,
     and the writings of the Fathers, a clearer typology was
     maintained.<P>



The point is that such interpretations have an
     ancient, honorable, and legitimate place in Christian
     history and theology.<P>

<B>4.  What therefore is it that he says by the prophet?  And
let them eat of the goat offered for all their sins in the day of
the fast.  Hearken diligently (my brethren): all the priests will
eat only the inwards not washed with vinegar.</B><P>



Exodus 29:13, 17, 22 and Leviticus chapters 1-7
     give instructions for various kinds of sacrifices, but
     no mention of washing with vinegar.  Leviticus 14:4
     mentions the use of scarlet and hyssop, but only in the
     sacrifice of birds.  Regarding the two goats, one a
     scapegoat, see Leviticus 16:5-10, 21-26.  The details
     mentioned by Barnabas are not found in the canonical
     scriptures, so either we can assume them to have been
     practiced, or else he strayed from the facts.<P>

<B>5.  Why so?  Because I know that when I shall hereafter
offer my flesh for the sins of a new people, you will give me
vinegar to drink mixed with gall; therefore do you only eat, the
people fasting meanwhile and lamenting in sackcloth and ashes.<BR>


6.  And that he might foreshow that he was to suffer for
them, hear then how he appointed it.<BR>


7.  Take, says he, two goats, fair and alike, and offer
them, and let the high priest take one of them for a burned
offering.  And what must be done with the other?  Let it, says
he, be accursed.<BR>


8.  Consider how exactly this appears to have been a type of
Jesus: And let all the congregation spit upon it, and prick it,
and put the scarlet wool about its head, and thus let it be
carried forth into the wilderness.<BR>


9.  And this being done, he that was appointed to convey the
goat, led it into the wilderness, and took away the scarlet wool,
and put it upon a thorn bush, whose young sprouts when we find
them in the field we are accustomed to eat, because only the
fruit of that thorn is sweet.<BR>

10.  And to what end was this ceremony?  Consider: one was
offered upon the altar, the other was accursed.<BR>


11.  And why was that which was accursed crowned?  Because
they will see Christ in that day having a scarlet garment about
his body, and will say, Is not this he whom we crucified after we
had despised him, pierced him, mocked him?  Certainly this is he
who said that he was the Son of God.<BR>


12.  So he then will be similar to what he was on earth, the
Jews were commanded to take two fair and equal goats so that when
they hereafter will see our Savior coming in the clouds of
heaven, they may be amazed at the analogy of the goats.<BR>


13.  So again here you see a type of Jesus who was to suffer
for us.<BR>


14.  But what then signifies this, that the wool was to be
put into the midst of the thorns?<BR>


15.  This also is a figure of Jesus, sent out to the church. 
For as he who would take away the scarlet wool must undergo many
difficulties, because that thorn was very sharp, and only with
difficulty could he get it, Christ says, They that will see me
and come to my kingdom, must attain to me through many
afflictions and troubles.</B><P>



It may well be that these are unrecorded words of
     Christ, but they appear as Paul's exhortation to the
     disciples after his stoning at Lystra, at which
     apparently Barnabas was a witness.  See Acts 14:14, 22.<P>

<B>CHAPTER 7</B><BR>


<I>The red heifer, another type of Christ.</I><P>

<B>1.  But what type do you suppose it to have been, where it
is commanded to the people of Israel, that grown persons in whom
sins are come to perfection, should offer an heifer, and after
they had killed it should burn it?</B><P>



This sacrifice is mentioned in Numbers 19:2-10,
     but as before, without all the details mentioned here.<P>

<B>2.  Then young men should take up the ashes and put them in
vessels, and tie a piece of scarlet wool and hyssop upon a stick,
and so the young men should sprinkle every one of the people, and
they would be clear from their sins.<BR>


3.  Consider how all these are delivered in a figure to us.<BR>


4.  This heifer is Jesus Christ, the wicked men that were to
offer it are those sinners who brought him to death, who
afterwards have no more to do with it; the sinners have no more
the honor of handling it.<BR>


5.  The young men who performed the sprinkling signified
those who preach to us the forgiveness of sins and the
purification of the heart.  The Lord gave authority to preach his
Gospel at the beginning to twelve, to signify the tribes, because
there were twelve tribes of Israel.<BR>


6.  But why were there three young men appointed to
sprinkle?  To denote Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, because they
were great before God.<BR>


7.  And why was the wool put upon a stick?  Because the
kingdom of Jesus was founded upon the cross; therefore they that
put their trust in him will live for ever.<BR>


8.  But why was the wool and hyssop put together?  To
signify that in the kingdom of Christ there will be evil and
filthy days, in which however we shall be saved; and because he
who has any disease in the flesh caused by some filthy fluids is
cured by hyssop.</B><P>



A branch of hyssop (a fragrant, blue-flowered
     plant of the mint family) was used routinely in
     ceremonial sprinklings of water or blood  (Exodus
     12:22; Leviticus 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52; Numbers 19:6, 18;
     Hebrews 9:19).  Its supposed physical curative power,
     however, is not mentioned in Scripture, unless one
     wishes to depart from the usual spiritual
     interpretation of "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be
     clean..." (Psalm 51:7).  (John 19:29 mentions that
     hyssop soaked in vinegar was given to Jesus.)<P>

<B>9.  These things done this way are to us indeed evident, but
to the Jews they are obscure, because they hearkened not to the
voice of the Lord.</B><P>



Compare with: "Neither by the blood of goats and
     calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into
     the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for
     us].  For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the
     ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth
     to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the
     blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered
     himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
     dead works to serve the living God?" (Hebrews 9:12-14)<P>

	 <B>CHAPTER 8</B><BR>
<I>Of the circumcision of the ears, and how in the first institution
of circumcision Abraham mystically foretold Christ by name.</I><P>



<B>1.  And therefore the Scripture again speaks concerning our
ears, that God has circumcised them together with our hearts. 
For the Lord says by the holy prophets, By the hearing of the ear
they obeyed me.</B><P>



This is from Psalm 17:44 in the Septuagint, where
     the chapter and verse divisions are different: "At the
     hearing of the ear they obeyed me..."<P>

<B>2.  And again, They who are afar off will hear and
understand what things I have done.  And again, Circumcise your
hearts, says the Lord.</B><P>



Compare with: "Hear, ye [that are] far off, what I
     have done; and, ye [that are] near, acknowledge my
     might." (Isaiah 33:13); "Circumcise yourselves to the
     Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men
     of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury
     come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench
     [it], because of the evil of your doings." (Jeremiah
     4:4)<P>

<B>3.  And again he says, Hear O Israel!  For thus says the
Lord your God.  And again the Spirit of God prophesies, saying,
Whoever would live forever, let him hear the voice of my Son.</B><P>



The source of these citations is uncertain.<P>

<B>4.  And again, Hear, O Heaven, and give ear, O Earth! 
Because the Lord has spoken these things for a witness.</B><P>



See Isaiah 1:2.<P>


<B>5.  And again he says, Hear the word of the Lord, you
princes of the people.  And again, Hear, O Children, the voice of
one crying in the wilderness.</B><P>



See Judges 5:3 and Isaiah 40:3.<P>

<B>6.  He has circumcised our ears so that we should hear his
word, and believe.  But as for that circumcision, in which the
Jews trust, it is abolished.  For the circumcision of which God
spoke was not of the flesh;<BR>


7.  But they have transgressed his commands, because the
evil one has deceived them.  For thus God speaks to them; Thus
says the Lord your God (Here I find the new law) Sow not among
thorns, but circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God.  And what
does he mean by this saying?  Hearken to your Lord.</B><P>



See Jeremiah 4:3, 4.<P>

<B>8.  And again he says, Circumcise the hardness of your
heart, and harden not your neck.  And again the Lord says, Behold
all the nations are uncircumcised (they have not lost their
foreskin), but this people is uncircumcised in heart.</B><P>



Compare with: "Circumcise therefore the foreskin
     of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked."
     (Deuteronomy 10:16)<P>

<B>9.  But you will say the Jews were circumcised for a sign. 
And so are all the Syrians and Arabians, and all the idolatrous
priests, but are they therefore of the covenant of Israel?  And
even the Egyptians themselves are circumcised.</B><P>



See Romans 2:25ff.<P>

<B>10.  Understand therefore, children, these things more
fully, that Abraham, who was the first that brought in
circumcision, looking forward in the Spirit to Jesus, was
circumcised, having received the mystery of three letters.<BR>


11.  For the Scripture says that Abraham circumcised three
hundred and eighteen men of his house.  But what was the mystery
that was made known to him?<BR>


12.  Mark, first the eighteen, and next the three hundred. 
For the numeral letters of ten and eight are I H.  And these
denote Jesus.<BR>


13.  And because it was by the cross we were to find grace,
he said, three hundred; the note of which is T (the figure of his
cross).  Therefore by two letters he signified Jesus, and by the
third his cross.</B><P>



          Genesis 17:13 says Abraham circumcised all his
     male servants, and Genesis 14:14 numbers them at three
     hundred and eighteen.  The first two letters of the
     name Jesus in Greek are IH, but it is unclear how "the
     numeral letters of ten and eight are I H" is arrived
     at, for those are not the tenth and eighth letters of
     the Greek alphabet.  The first letter of the compound
     word "three hundred" in Greek is T, and it may well
     have been the form of the cross at the Crucifixion, for
     it is so pictured in early Christian art (in medieval
     art it is often Y-shaped).<P>



Although many of the early Church Fathers
     concurred with this ingenious but fantastically
     extravagant interpretation, it merely shows how
     obsessed they were with finding obscure evidences of
     Christ in the Old Testament.  Note that it all is based
     on a reading of the Septuagint, written not in Hebrew,
     but in Greek.<P>

<B>14.  He who has put the engrafted gift of his doctrine
within us, knows that I never taught to anyone a more certain
truth; but I trust that you are worthy of it.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 9</B><BR>

<I>That the commands of Moses concerning clean and unclean beasts,
etc., were all designed for a spiritual significance.</I><P>

<B>1.  But why did Moses say, You must not eat of the swine,
neither the eagle nor the hawk; nor the crow; nor any fish that
has not a scale upon it?  Because he comprehended three doctrines
that were to be gathered in the understanding.</B><P>



Leviticus 11 contains the Old Testament Jewish
     dietary laws.  It was permitted to eat animals that
     chewed the cud, providing they also had cloven hoofs. 
     Permitted seafood must have both fins and scales.<P>



Animals or birds specifically forbidden (as
     translated in The New English Bible) were the camel,
     rock-rabbit or rock-badger, hare, pig; griffon-vulture,
     black vulture, bearded vulture; the kite and every kind
     of falcon; every kind of crow and raven, the desert-
     owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, every kind of
     hawk; the tawny owl, fisher-owl, screech-owl; the
     little owl, the horned owl, the osprey, the stork or
     heron, every kind of cormorant, the hoopoe, and the
     bat; all four-footed wild animals that go on flat paws;
     the mole-rat (weasel), the jerboa, every kind of thorn-
     tailed lizard, the gecko, the sand-gecko, the wall-
     gecko, the great lizard, and the chameleon; all
     creatures that teem on the ground, crawl on their
     bellies, go on all fours or have many legs are
     forbidden as vermin.<P>



Every teeming winged creature with four legs was
     forbidden as vermin, yet it was permissible to eat the
     great locust, long-headed locust, green locust, and the
     desert locust!<P>

<B>2.  So he says to them in the book of Deuteronomy, I will
give my statutes to this people.  Therefore it is not the command
of God that they should not eat these things, but Moses in the
spirit spoke to them.</B><P>



Here Barnabas makes the vital point in Biblical
     interpretation of noting who says what to whom: "And
     the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you
     statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the
     land wither ye go over to possess it." (Deuteronomy
     4:14)<P>

<B>3.  He forbade them to eat the sow, meaning: You must not
join yourself to such persons who are like swine, who while they
live in pleasure, forget their God; but when any lack pinches
them, then they recognize the Lord; just as the sow when she is
full does not acknowledge her master, but makes a noise when she
is hungry, and being fed again, is silent.<BR>


4.  Neither, says he, will you eat the eagle, nor the hawk,
nor the kite, nor the crow; that is, you must not keep company
with the kind of men who do not know how to get themselves food
by their labor and sweat, but injuriously steal the things of
others and watch how to lay snares for them, when at the same
time they appear to live in perfect innocence.<BR>


5.  So these birds alone seek not food for themselves, but
sitting idle seek how they may eat the flesh others have
provided, being destructive through their wickedness.<BR>


6.  Neither, says he, will you eat the lamprey, nor the
polypus, nor the cuttle-fish; that is, you must not become like
such men, by being used to conversing with them, who are
altogether wicked and adjudged to death.  For so these fishes are
alone accursed, and wallow in the mire, and do not swim as other
fishes, but tumble in the dirt at the bottom of the deep.<BR>


7.  But he adds, neither must you eat of the hare.  To what
end?  To signify this to us: You must not be an adulterer, nor be
like such persons.  For the hare every year multiplies the places
of its conception; and so many years as it lives, so many it has.</B><P>



The hare was forbidden "because he cheweth the
     cud, but divideth not the hoof" (Leviticus 11:6); but
     Barnabas is consistent in his anthropomorphic-
     metaphorical exegesis.<P>

<B>8.  Neither must you eat of the hyena: that is, again, be
not an adulterer, nor a corruptor of others, neither be like
such.  And why so?  Because that creature every year changes its
kind, and is sometimes male and sometimes female.</B><P>



This is pure fantasy or folklore; the hyena is
     nowhere mentioned in the Bible.<P>

<B>9.  For which reason also he justly hated the weasel, to the
end that they should not be like such persons who with their
mouths commit wickedness by reason of their uncleanness, nor join
themselves with those impure women who with their mouths commit
wickedness.  Because that animal conceives with its mouth.</B><P>



Whatever is meant by this is uncertain; but
     Barnabas is clearly opposed to oral sex.<P>

<B>10.  Moses, therefore, speaking as if concerning meats,
delivered indeed three great precepts to them in the spiritual
significance of those commands.  But they according to the
desires of the flesh, understood him as if he had only meant it
about meats.<BR>


11.  And therefore David took aright the knowledge of his
three-fold command, saying in like manner.</B><P>



This "three-fold command," mentioned also in verse
     1, is not clear.  The reference which follows is from
     Psalm 1.<P>

<B>12.  Blessed in the man that has not walked in the counsel
of the ungodly; as the fishes before mentioned in the bottom of
the deep in darkness.<BR>


13.  Nor stood in the way of sinners; as they who seem to
fear the Lord, but yet sin, as the sow.<BR>


14.  And has not sat in the seat of the scorners; as those
birds who sit and watch that they may devour.<BR>


15.  Here you have the law concerning meat perfectly set
forth, and according to the true knowledge of it.<BR>


16.  But, says Moses, you may eat all that divides the hoof
and chews the cud.  This means one that after taking food, knows
him that nourishes him, and rests upon him, and rejoices in him.<BR>


17.  And in this he spoke well, having respect to the
commandment.  What, therefore, is it that he says?  That we
should hold fast to them that fear the Lord, those who meditate
on the command of the word that they have received in their
heart, and with those that declare the righteous judgments of the
Lord and keep his commandments;<BR>


18.  In short, with those who know that to meditate is a
work of pleasure, and therefore exercise themselves in the word
of the Lord.</B><P>



To distinguish between currently popularized "New
     Age meditation" and Biblical meditation, it is worth
     noting that the word in Scripture means "to think
     deeply."<P>

<B>19.  But why might they eat those that cleave the hoof? 
Because the righteous lives in this present world, but his
expectation is fixed upon the other.  See, brethren, how
admirably Moses commanded these things.<BR>


20.  But how should we know and understand all this?  We,
therefore, understanding aright the commandments, speak as the
Lord would have us.  He has circumcised our ears and our hearts,
in order that we might know these things.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 10</B><BR>
<I>Baptism and the Cross of Christ foretold in figures under the
law.</I><P>

<B>1.  Let us now inquire whether the Lord took care to reveal
anything beforehand concerning water and the cross.<BR>


2.  Now for the former of these, it is written to the people
of Israel how they will not receive that baptism which brings
forgiveness of sins, but will institute another to themselves
that cannot.<BR>


3.  For thus says the prophet: Be astonished, O Heaven!  And
let the earth tremble at it, because this people have done two
great and wicked things: they have left me, the fountain of
living water, and have dug for themselves broken cisterns that
can hold no water.</B><P>



See Jeremiah 2:12, 13.<P>

<B>4.  Is my holy mountain a Zion, a desolate wilderness?  For
you will be as a young bird when its nest is taken away.</B><P>



See Isaiah 16:1, 2<P>

<B>5.  And again the prophet says, I will go before you, and
will make plain the mountains, and will break the gates of brass,
and will snap in pieces the bars of iron; and I will give you
dark, hidden, and invisible treasures, that they may know that I
am the Lord God.</B><P>

See Isaiah 45:2, 3.<P>

<B>6.  And again, He will dwell in the high den of the strong rock. 
And then, what follows in the same prophet?  His water is
faithful; you will see the king with glory, and your soul will
learn the fear of the Lord.</B><P>



See Isaiah 33:16, 17.<P>

<B>7.  And again he says in another prophet, He that does these
things will be like a tree, planted by the currents of water,
which will give its fruit in its season.  Its leaf also will not
wither, and whatever he does will prosper.</B><P>



Again a reference to Psalm 1.<P>

<B>8.  As for the wicked, it is not so with them; they are as
the dust which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth.<BR>


9.  Therefore the ungodly will not stand in the judgment,
neither sinners in the council of the righteous.  For the Lord
knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly will
perish.<BR>


10.  Consider how he has joined both the cross and the water
together.<BR>


11.  For thus he says: Blessed are they who put their trust
in the cross and descend into the water, for they will have their
reward in due time; then, he says, I will give it to them.<BR>


12.  But concerning the present time, he says their leaves
will not fall, meaning that every word that will go out of our
mouth through faith and charity will be to the conversion and
hope of many.<BR>

     
13.  In a similar manner another prophet speaks, And the
land of Jacob was the praise of all the earth, magnifying by that
the vessel of his spirit.</B><P>



By the "vessel of his spirit" is apparently meant
     the body of Christ.  The quote referred to is likely
     Zephaniah 3:19.<P>

<B>14.  And what follows?  And there was a river running on the
right hand, and beautiful trees grew up by it, and he that will
eat of them will live forever.  The significance of which is
this: that we go down into the water full of sins and pollutions
but come up again, bringing forth fruit because we have in our
hearts by the spirit the fear and hope which is in Jesus.  And
whoever will eat of them will live forever.</B><P>



Perhaps a reference to: "And by the river upon the
     bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow
     all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither
     shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring
     forth new fruit according to his months, because their
     waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit
     thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for
     medicine." (Ezekiel 47:12)<P>

<B>15.  That is, whoever will pay attention to those who call
them, and will believe, will live forever.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 11</B><BR>
<I>The subject continued.</I><P>

<B>1.  In a similar manner he determines concerning the cross
in another prophet saying, And when will these things be
fulfilled?<BR>


2.  The Lord answers, When the tree that has fallen will
rise, and when blood will drop down from the tree.  Here you have
again mention made both of the cross and of him that was to be
crucified upon it.</B><P>



The source for this citation is unknown.<P>

<B>3.  And yet further he says by Moses, when Israel was
fighting with, and beaten by, a strange people, to the end that
God might teach them how that for their sins they were delivered
to death, yes, the Holy Spirit put it into the heart of Moses to
represent both the sign of the cross and of him that was to
suffer so that they might know that if they did not believe in
him, they would be overcome forever.<BR>


4.  Moses therefore piled up armor upon armor in the middle
of a rising ground, and standing up high above all of them,
stretched forth his arms, and so Israel again conquered.<BR>


5.  But no sooner did he let down his hands, but they were
again slain.  And why so?  So they might know that except they
trust in him, they cannot be saved.</B><P>



See Exodus 17:8-12.  Many Church Fathers believed
     Moses and his outstretched arms symbolized the cross.<P>

<B>6.  And in another prophet he says, I have stretched out my
hands all day long to a people who are disobedient and speak
against my righteous way.</B><P>


Compare with: "I have spread out my hands all the
     day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way
     [that was] not good, after their own thoughts." (Isaiah
     65:2); "But to Israel he saith, All day long I have
     stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and
     gainsaying people." (Romans 10:21)<P>

<B>7.  And again Moses makes a type of Jesus in the example of
those that fell in Israel, to show that he was to die, and then
that he, whom they thought to be dead, was to give life to
others.</B><P>



Verses 7-11 describe the story (in Numbers 21:6-9)
     how Moses erected on a pole a brazen serpent, to which
     those bitten by fiery serpents could look and be
     healed.  In the above verse "to show that he was to
     die, and then that he, whom they thought to be dead,
     was to give life to others" refers to Christ.<P>

<B>8.  For God caused all sorts of serpents to bite them, and
they died, just as by a serpent transgression began in Eve, so
that so he might convince them that they will be delivered into
the pain of death for their transgressions.<BR>


9.  Moses, who had commanded them, then said, You must not
make to yourselves any graven or molten image to be your God; yet
now did so himself so that he might represent to them the figure
of the Lord Jesus.<BR>


10.  For he made a brazen serpent, and set it up on high,
and called the people together by a proclamation.  When they
came, they entreated Moses that he would make an atonement for
them and pray so they might be healed.<BR>


11.  Then Moses spoke to them, saying: When any one among
you will be bitten, let him come to the serpent that is set upon
the pole, and let him assuredly trust in him, for though he be
dead, yet he is able to give life, and presently he will be
saved; and so they did.  See therefore how here also you have in
this the glory of Jesus, and that in him and to him are all
things.</B><P>



Barnabas is on solid exegetical ground here
     (Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, and St. John Chrysostum
     concurred) for Christ himself said to Nicodemus: "And
     as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
     so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever
     believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
     life." (John 3:14, 15); Romans 11:36 says: "For of him,
     and through him, and to him [are] all things: to whom
     [be] glory for ever.  Amen."<P>

<B>12.  Again, consider what Moses, being a prophet, said to
Jesus the son of Nun, when he gave that name to him so that all
the people might hear him alone, because the Father did manifest
all things concerning his son Jesus, in Jesus the son of Nun. 
When he sent him to spy out the land of Canaan, he gave him that
name and said, Take a book in your hands, and write what the Lord
says: inasmuch as Jesus the Son of God will in the last days cut
off by the roots all the house of Amalek.  See here again Jesus,
not the son of man, but the Son of God, made manifest in a type
and in the flesh.</B><P>



See Exodus 17:14.  (The New Testament equivalent
     of the name Joshua, or Jeshua, which means Jehovah is
     salvation, is Jesus.)<P>

<B>13.  But because it later might be said that Christ was the
Son of David, therefore David fearing and well knowing the errors
of the wicked, says, The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right
hand until I make your enemies your footstool.</B><P>



See Psalm 110:1.<P>

<B>14.  And again Isaiah speaks like this. The Lord said to
Christ my Lord, I have laid hold on his right hand, that the
nations should obey before him, and I will break the strength of
kings.</B><P>



The source of this is obscure; there is no such
     reference in the Bible.<P>

<B>15.  Behold how David and Isaiah call him Lord and the Son
of God.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 12</B><BR>
<I>The promise of God is not made only to the Jews, but also to the
Gentiles, and fulfilled to us by Jesus Christ.</I><P>

<B>1.  But let us go yet further, and inquire whether this
people be the heir, or the former; and whether the covenant be
with us or with them.<BR>


2.  And first, as concerning the people, hear now what the
Scripture says.<BR>


3.  Isaac prayed for his wife Rebecca because she was
barren, and she conceived.  Afterwards Rebecca went forth to
inquire of the Lord.<BR>


4.  And the Lord said to her, There are two nations in your
womb, and two people will come from your body; and the one will
have power over the other, and the greater will serve the lesser. 
Understand here who was Isaac, and who was Rebecca, and of whom
it was foretold that this people will be greater than that.</B><P>



Compare Genesis 25:21-23 with: "Who are
     Israelites.... For they [are] not all Israel, which are
     of Israel: Neither, because they are the seed of
     Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall
     thy seed be called.  That is, They which are the
     children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of
     God: but the children of the promise are counted for
     the seed..." (Romans 9:5, 6-8, 10-16)<P>

<B>5.  In another prophecy Jacob speaks more clearly to his son
Joseph, saying, Behold the Lord has not deprived me of seeing
your face, so bring me your sons that I may bless them.  And he
brought to his father Manasseh and Ephraim, desiring that he
should bless Manasseh, because he was the elder.<BR>


6.  Therefore Joseph brought him to the right hand of his
father Jacob.  But Jacob by the spirit foresaw the figure of the
people that was to come.<BR>


7.  And what says the Scripture?  And Jacob crossed his
hands, and put his right hand upon Ephraim, his second and
younger son, and blessed him.  And Joseph said to Jacob, Put your
right hand upon the head of Manasseh, for he is my first-born. 
And Jacob said to Joseph, I know it, my son, I know it; but the
greater will serve the lesser; though he also will be blessed.<BR>


8.  You see of whom he appointed it, that they should be the
first people, and heirs of the covenant</B><P>



See Genesis 48.  A careful reading shows Jacob
     indeed crossed his hands to give his blessing; to the
     Church Fathers this was another symbol of Christ's
     cross.<P>

<B>9.  If God took notice of this also by Abraham, our
understanding of it will then be perfectly established.<BR>


10.  What says the Scripture to Abraham when he believed,
and it was imputed to him for righteousness?  Behold I have made
you a father of the nations that without circumcision believe in
the Lord.</B><P>

Abraham was living by faith when he was seventy-
     five years old and his faith was imputed to him for
     righteousness, but he was not circumcised until he was
     ninety-nine years old: see Genesis 12:4, 15:3-6, 17:6-
     11, 24.  Compare with: "What shall we say then that
     Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath
     found?  For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath
     [whereof] to glory;; but not before God.  For what
     saith the scripture?  Abraham believed God, and it was
     counted to him for righteousness.  Now to him that
     worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of
     debt.  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on
     him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted
     for righteousness." (Romans 4:1-5)<P>

<B>11.  Let us therefore now inquire whether God has fulfilled
the covenant he swore to our fathers, that he would give this
people?  Yes, truly, he gave it; but they were not worthy to
receive it because of their sins.<BR>


12.  For thus says the prophet, And Moses continued fasting
forty days and forty nights in Mount Sinai, to receive the
covenant of the Lord with the people.<BR>


13.  And he received from the Lord two tables written with
the finger of the Lord's hand in the Spirit.  And when Moses
received them he brought them down to deliver them to the people.<BR>


14.  And the Lord said to Moses: Moses, Moses, get down
quickly, for the people you brought out of the land of Egypt have
done wickedly.<BR>


15.  And Moses understood that they had again set up a
molten image; and he cast the two tables out of his hands, and
the tables of the covenant of the Lord were broken.  Moses
received them, but they were not worthy.</B><P>



See Exodus 24:18; 32:7-9, 15-29, and Deuteronomy
     9:9-21.<P>

<B>16.  Now then learn how we have received them.  Moses, being
a servant, took them; but the Lord himself, having suffered for
us, has given them to us in order that we might be the people of
his inheritance.<BR>


17.  He was manifested that they should fill up the measure
of their sins; and that we, being made heirs by him, should
receive the covenant of the Lord Jesus.<BR>


18.  Again the prophet says, Behold, I have assigned you to
be a light to the Gentiles for salvation to all the ends of the
earth, says the Lord your God who has redeemed you.</B><P>



See Isaiah 49:6.<P>

<B>19.  Who was prepared for that very purpose so by his own
appearing he might redeem our hearts, already devoured by death
and delivered over to the irregularity of error, from darkness;
and establish a covenant with us by his word.<BR>


20.  For so it is written that the Father commanded him by
delivering us from darkness, to prepare to himself a holy people.<BR>


21.  Therefore the prophet says, I the Lord your God have
called you in righteousness, and I will take you by your hand and
will strengthen you.  And give you as a covenant of the people,
for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to
bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in
darkness out of the prison house.</B><P>

See Isaiah 42:6, 7.<P>

<B>22.  Consider therefore for what we have been redeemed.  And
again the prophet says, The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he has anointed me; he has sent me to preach glad tidings
to the lowly, to heal the broken in heart, to preach remission to
the captives and sight to the blind, to proclaim the acceptable
year of the Lord and the day of restitution, and to comfort all
that mourn.</B><P>



Compare Isaiah 61:1, 2 with: "And there was
     delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias, And
     when he had opened the book, he found the place where
     it was written, The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me,
     because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the
     poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
     preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of
     sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
     bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. 
     And he closed the book, and he gave [it] again to the
     minister, and sat down.  And the eyes of all them that
     were in the synagogue were fastened on him.  And he
     began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
     fulfilled in your ears." (Luke 4:17-21)<P>

<B>CHAPTER 13</B><BR>
<I>That the Sabbath of the Jews was but a figure of a more glorious
Sabbath to come, and their temple, of the spiritual temples of
God.</I><P>

<B>1.  Furthermore it is written concerning the Sabbath, in the
ten commandments which God spoke face to face in Mount Sinai to
Moses, Sanctify the Sabbath of the Lord with pure hands and with
a clean heart.</B><P>



See Exodus 20:8.<P>

<B>2.  Elsewhere he says, If your children will keep my
Sabbaths, then will I put my mercy upon them.</B><P>



Perhaps a condensed reference to Leviticus 26:2-5.<P>

<B>3.  And even in the beginning of the creation he makes
mention of the Sabbath: And God made in six days the works of his
hands; and he finished them on the seventh day, and he rested the
seventh day, and sanctified it.</B><P>



See Genesis 2:2, 3; that this was the basis of the
     Sabbath is stated in Exodus 20:11.<P>

<B>4.  Consider, my children, what it signifies, that he
finished them in six days.  The meaning of it is this: that in
six thousand years the Lord God will bring all things to an end.<BR>


5.  For with him one day is a thousand years, as he himself
testifies, saying, Behold this day will be as a thousand years. 
Therefore, children, in six days, that is, in six thousand years,
will all things be accomplished.</B><P>



That is, all things will be accomplished up to the
     time of the Gospel.  This was a popular interpretation
     at that time, based on "For a thousand years in thy
     sight [are but] as yesterday when it is past, and [as]
     a watch in the night" (Psalm 90:4), and "But, beloved,
     be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is]
     with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
     as one day" (2 Peter 3:8).<P>


Many cults have been created and many people have
     been led astray by the practice of setting dates for
     prophesied events.  That some in the early Church
     engaged in such speculation is surprising in view of
     Christ's words to his disciples after the Resurrection:
     "When they therefore were come together, they asked of
     him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again
     the kingdom to Israel?  And he said unto them, It is
     not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the
     Father hath put in his own power." (Acts 1:6, 7)<P>

<B>6.  And he rested the seventh day, means this: that when his
Son will come, and abolish the season of the Wicked One, and
judge the ungodly, and will change the sun and the moon and the
stars, then he will gloriously rest in that seventh day.</B><P>



Compare with: "But the day of the Lord will come
     as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall
     pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
     melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works
     that are therein shall be burned up.  Seeing then
     [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
     [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation
     and godliness,  Looking for and hasting unto the coming
     of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire
     shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
     fervent heat?  Nevertheless we, according to his
     promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
     dwelleth righteousness." (2 Peter 3:10-13)<P>

<B>7.  He adds lastly, You will sanctify it with clean hands
and a pure heart.  Therefore we are greatly deceived if we
imagine that anyone can now sanctify that day which God has made
holy, without having a heart pure in all things.<BR>


8.  Behold therefore, he will then truly sanctify it with
blessed rest, when we having received the righteous promise, when
iniquity will be no more, and all things have been renewed by the
Lord, will be able to sanctify it, because we ourselves will
first be made holy.<BR>


9.  Lastly he says to them, I cannot stand your new moons
and your Sabbaths.  Consider what he means by it: the Sabbaths,
he says, that you now keep are not acceptable to me, but only
those which I have made, when resting from all things I shall
begin the eighth day, that is, the beginning of the other world.</B><P>

Compare with: "...the new moons and sabbaths, the
     calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; [it is]
     iniquity, even the solemn meeting." (Isaiah 1:13)<P>

<B>10.  For which cause we observe the eighth day with
gladness, in which Jesus rose from the dead, and after showing
himself to his disciples, ascended into heaven.</B><P>



Compare with: "...ye shall keep a feast unto the
     Lord seven days: on the first day [shall be] a sabbath,
     and on the eighth day [shall be] a sabbath." (Leviticus
     23:30)<P>



This concept of the "eighth day" is mentioned in
     the writings of some Church Fathers, and has several
     connotations.  In a literal sense, of course, it
     corresponds to the first day of the week (Sunday), when
     Christ rose from the dead after his redemptive work was
     finished.  In an eschatological (prophetic) sense, it
     refers to Christ's coming again and the ensuing eternal
     bliss of the faithful.  Some monks of the Orthodox
     Church used the term mystically to represent the
     advanced state of personal spirituality.<P>

<B>11.  [New paragraph in the oldest extant manuscripts]  It
still remains for me to speak to you concerning the temple, how
these miserable men, being deceived, have put their trust in the
house as if it were the habitation of God, and not in God himself
who made them,<BR>


12.  For much after the same manner as the Gentiles, they
consecrated him in the temple.<BR>


13.  But learn therefore how the Lord speaks, rendering the
temple vain: Who has measured the full extent of heaven, or the
earth with his hand?  Is it not I?  Thus says the Lord, Heaven is
my throne, and the earth is my footstool.  What is the house that
you will build me?  Or what is the place of my rest?  Know
therefore that all their hope is vain.</B><P>



Compare with: "Who hath measured the waters in the
     hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span,
     and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,
     and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
     balance?" (Isaiah 40:12); and "Thus saith the Lord, The
     heaven [is] my throne, and the earth [is] my footstool:
     where [is] the house that ye build unto me? and where
     [is] the place of my rest?" (Isaiah 66:1)<P>

<B>14.  And again he speaks after this manner: Behold they that
destroy this temple, even they will again build it up.  And so it
came to pass, for through their wars it was destroyed by their
enemies, and the servants of their enemies built it up.</B><P>



The reference is uncertain.  Compare with: "Our
     holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised
     thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant
     things are laid waste." (Isaiah 64:11); "... came
     Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the
     king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: And he burnt the house
     of the Lord..." (2 Kings 25:8,9); "They have cast fire
     into thy sanctuary, they have defiled [by casting down]
     the dwelling place of thy name to the ground." (Psalm
     74:7)<P>

It is unlikely this cites Ezra 6:12, for the Jews
     themselves rebuilt a rather shabby temple after their
     return from the Exile.  However, when Rome set up its
     puppet government over the Jews, their appointee, Herod
     the Great, in fact rebuilt the Temple of Jerusalem.<P>

<B>15.  Furthermore it has been made evident how both the city
and the temple, and the people of Israel, should be given up. 
For the Scripture says, And it will come to pass in the last
days, that the Lord will deliver up the sheep of his pasture, and
their fold, and their tower into destruction.  And it is come to
pass, as the Lord has spoken.</B><P>



Compare with: "And it shall come to pass at that
     time, [that] I will search Jerusalem with candles, and
     punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say
     in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will
     he do evil.  Therefore their goods shall become a
     booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also
     build houses, but not inhabit [them]; and they shall
     plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof."
     (Zephaniah 1:12, 13); the Septuagint reads: "And it
     shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will search
     Jerusalem with a candle, and will take vengeance on the
     men that despise the things committed to them; but they
     say in their hearts, The Lord will not do any good,
     neither will he do any evil.  And their power shall be
     for a spoil, and their houses for utter desolation; and
     they shall build houses, but shall not dwell in them;
     and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the
     wine of them."<P>



"And the sea coast shall be dwellings [and]
     cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks."
     (Zephaniah 2:6); the Septuagint reads: "And Crete shall
     be a pasture of flocks, and a fold of sheep;" but the
     Hebrew is closer to Barnabas' allusion.<P>

<B>16.  Let us therefore inquire whether there is any temple of
God.  Yes there is, where he himself declares that he would both
make and perfect it.  For it is written, As soon as the week will
be completed, the temple of the Lord will be gloriously built in
the name of the Lord.</B><P>



Compare Daniel 9:24, 25, and Haggai 2:9.<P>

<B>17.  I find therefore that there is a temple.  But how will
it be built in the name of the Lord?  I will show you.<BR>


18.  Before we believed in God, the habitation of our heart
was as corruptible and feeble as a temple truly built with hands.<BR>

19.  For it was a house full of idolatry, a house of devils;
inasmuch as there was done in it whatever was contrary to God. 
But it will be built in the name of the Lord.<BR>


20.  Consider how that the temple of the Lord will be very
gloriously built, and learn by what means that will be.<BR>


21.  Having received remission of our sins, and trusting in
the name of the Lord, we are become renewed, being again created
as it were from the beginning.  Therefore God truly dwells in our
house, that is, in us.<BR>


22.  But how does he dwell in us?  Through the word of his
faith, the calling of his promise, the wisdom of his righteous
judgments, and the commands of his doctrine.  He himself
prophesies within us, he himself dwells in us, and opens to us
who were in bondage of death the gate of our temple, that is, the
mouth of wisdom, having given repentance to us; and by this means
he has brought us to be an incorruptible temple.<BR>


23.  He therefore who desires to be saved looks not to the
man, but to him that dwells in him, and speaks by him, because he
is struck with wonder, for he never either heard him speaking
such words out of his mouth, nor ever desired to hear them.<BR>


24.  This is that spiritual temple that is built to the
Lord.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 14</B><BR>
<I>Of the way of light, a summary of what a Christian is to do, that
he may be happy forever.</I><P>

<B>1.  And thus, I trust, I have declared to you as much, and
with as great simplicity as I could, those things which make for
your salvation, so as not to have omitted anything that might be
requisite thereto.<BR>


2.  For should I speak further of the things that now are,
and of those that are to come, you would not yet understand them,
seeing they lie in parables.  What I have said will suffice as to
these things.</B><P>

Parables can both reveal and conceal; compare with
     Christ's remark to his disciples: "And he said unto
     them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the
     kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all
     [these] things are done in parables; That seeing they
     may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear,
     and not understand; lest at any time they should be
     converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.
     (Mark 4:11, 12)<P>

"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, [is] come,
     he will guide you into all truth... and he will shew
     you things to come." (John 16:13); "But the Comforter,
     [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in
     my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all
     things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
     you." (John 14:26); "Which things also we speak, not in
     the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the
     Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
     spiritual." (1 Corinthians 2:13); "But the anointing
     which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye
     need not that any man teach you, but as the same
     anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and
     is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall
     abide in him." (1 John 2:27)<P>

<B>3.  Let us now go on to the other kind of knowledge and
doctrine.  There are two ways of doctrine and power: the one of
light, the other of darkness.<BR>


4.  But there is a great deal of difference between these
two ways; for over one are appointed the angels of God, the
leaders of the way of light; over the other, the angels of Satan. 
And the one is the Lord from everlasting to everlasting; the
other is the prince of the time of unrighteousness.<BR>


5.  Now the way of light is this: if any one desires to
attain to the place that is appointed for him, he will hasten
there by his works.  And the knowledge that has been given to us
for walking in it, is to this effect: You must love him that made
you; you must glorify him that has redeemed you from death.<BR>


6.  You must be simple in heart, and rich in the spirit. 
You must not unite to those that walk in the way of death.  You
must hate to do anything that is not pleasing to God.  You must
abhor all dissimulation.  You must not neglect any of the
commands of the Lord.<BR>


7.  You must not exalt yourself, but must be humble.  You
must not take honor to yourself.  You must not enter into any
wicked counsel against your neighbor.  You must not be over-
confident in your heart.<BR>


8.  You must not commit fornication nor adultery.  Neither
must you corrupt yourself with mankind.  You must not make use of
the word of God to any impurity.<BR>


9.  You must not accept any man's person, when you reprove
anyone's faults.  You must be gentle.  You must be quiet.  You
must tremble at the words which you have heard.  You must not
keep any hatred in your heart against your brother.  You must not
entertain any doubt whether it will be or not.<BR>


10.  You must not take the name of the Lord in vain.  You
must love your neighbor above your own soul.<BR>


11.  You must not destroy your conceptions before they are
brought forth, nor kill them after they are born.</B><P>



Apparently abortion and infanticide were
     sufficiently common to warrant this exhortation.<P>

<B>12.  You must not withdraw your hand from your son, or from
your daughter, but will teach them from their youth the fear of
the Lord.<BR>


13.  You must not covet your neighbor's goods, neither must
you be greedy.  Neither must your heart be joined to proud men,
but you must be counted among the righteous and the lowly. 
Whatever events will happen to you, you must receive them as
good.<BR>


14.  You must not be double-minded, or double-tongued, for a
double tongue is the snare of death.  You must be subject in fear
and reverence to the Lord, and to inferior masters as to the
representatives of God.</B><P>



By "inferior masters," probably is meant the
     lowest order of clergy, the deacons, as contrasted with
     the presbyters, or priests.<P>

<B>15.  You must not be bitter when ordering any of your
servants who trust in God, for fear that you may not fear him who
is over both; because he came not to call any with respect of
persons, but whomever the Spirit had prepared.<BR>


16.  You must communicate to your neighbor of all you have;
you must not call anything your own, for if you share in such
things as are incorruptible, how much more should you do it in
those that are corruptible?<BR>


17.  You must not be too eager to speak, for the mouth is
the trap of death.  Strive for your soul with all your might.  Do
not reach out your hand to receive, and then withhold it when you
should give.<BR>


18.  You must love, as the apple of your eye, everyone that
speaks to you the word of the Lord.  Call to your remembrance,
day and night, the future judgment.<BR>


19.  You must seek out every day the persons of the
righteous, and both consider and go about to exhort others by the
word, and meditate how you may save a soul.<BR>


20.  You must also labor with your hands to give to the
poor, so that your sins may be forgiven you.  You must not
deliberate whether you should give, nor, having given, complain
about it.<BR>


21.  Give to every one that asks, so will you know who is
the good rewarder of your gifts.<BR>


22.  Keep what you have received; you must neither add to it
nor take from it.<BR>


23.  Let the wicked be always your aversion.  You must judge
righteous judgment.  You must never cause divisions, but make
peace between those that are at variance, and bring them
together.<BR>


24.  You must confess your sins and not come to your prayer
with an evil conscience.<BR>


25.  This is the way of light.</B><P>

<B>CHAPTER 15</B><BR>
<I>Of the way of darkness, that is, what kind of persons will
forever be cast out of the kingdom of God.</I><P>

<B>1.  But the way of darkness is crooked and full of cursing. 
For it is the way of eternal death, with punishment, in which
those that walk will meet those things that destroy their own
souls.<BR>


2.  Such are: idolatry, confidence, pride of power,
hypocrisy, double-mindedness, adultery, murder, pillage, pride,
transgression, deceit, malice, arrogance, witchcraft,
covetousness, and the lack of the fear of God.</B><P>



By "confidence" here is meant an overweening sense of
     self-confidence in one's abilities apart from God.<P>

<B>3.  In this walk those who are the persecutors of them that
are good, the haters of truth and lovers of lies, who do not know
the reward of righteousness, nor adhere to any thing that is
good.<BR>


4.  Who administer not righteous judgment to the widow and
orphan; who examine wickedness, and not the fear of the Lord;<BR>


5.  From whom gentleness and patience are afar off; who love
vanity, and follow after rewards; who have no compassion upon the
poor, nor take any pains for those who are burdened and
oppressed.<BR>


6.  They readily speak evil, not knowing him that made them;
they are murderers of children, corrupters of the creatures of
God; they turn away from the needy and oppress the afflicted;
they are advocates of the rich, but unjust judges of the poor;
they are altogether sinners.<BR>


7. It is therefore appropriate that, learning the just
commands of the Lord we have before mentioned, we should walk in
them.  For he who does such things will be glorified in the
kingdom of God.<BR>


8.  But he who chooses the other part will be destroyed,
together with his works.  For this reason there will be both a
resurrection, and a retribution.<BR>


9.  I implore those that are in high estate among you (if 
you will take the counsel that with a good intention I offer to
you), do not forsake those with you towards whom you may do good.<BR>


10.  For the day is at hand in which all things will be
destroyed, together with the wicked one.  The Lord is near, and
his reward is with him.</B><P>



To destroy also means to utterly defeat and lay
     waste; the Bible nowhere specifically implies the
     actual annihilation of the wicked.<P>

<B>11.  Therefore I ask you, again and again, be good lawgivers
to one another, continue to be faithful counselors to each
other, and remove from among you all hypocrisy.<BR>


12.  And may God, the Lord of all the world, give you
wisdom, knowledge, counsel, and understanding of his judgments in
patience.<BR>


13.  Be taught by God; seek what it is the Lord requires of
you, and do it, so that you may be saved in the day of judgment.<BR>


14.  And if there is any remembrance among you of what is
good, think of me by meditating on these things, so that both my
wishes and my watching for you may turn to a good account.<BR>


15.  I beg you, I ask it as a favor of you, that while you
are in this beautiful vessel of the body, be lacking in none of
these things, but seek them without ceasing and fulfill every
command, for these things are proper and worthy to be done.<BR>


16.  Wherefore I have diligently written to you, according
to my ability, that you might rejoice.  Farewell, children, in
love and peace.<BR>


17.  May the Lord of glory and of all grace be with your
spirit, Amen.</B><P>



Although we find echoes in the New Testament of
     nearly all the exhortations in this General Epistle of
     Barnabas, we must remember that he is not so much
     quoting but expressing the same thoughts as his
     contemporaries, for all the books of the New Testament
     had not yet been written (certainly not the Epistle of
     Jude's Epistle or the works of John, which include his
     Gospel, his three Epistles, and Revelation), and it
     would be centuries before the canon was officially
     decided.<P>



Cotelerius affirms that Origen and Jerome esteemed
     this Epistle genuine and canonical, although he himself
     did not believe it to be either one or the other; on
     the contrary, he supposes it was written for the
     benefit of the Ebionites (the christianized Jews) who
     were tenacious of rites and ceremonies.<P>



It lays a greater claim to canonical authority
     than most others and was read in the churches at
     Alexandria, as the canonical scriptures were.  It has
     been cited by Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Eusebius,
     and Jerome, and many ancient Fathers.<P>
