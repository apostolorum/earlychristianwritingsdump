INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO 
IRENAEUS AGAINST HERESIES.

<P>[a.d. 120-202.] This history introduces us to the Church in her western 
outposts. We reach the banks of the Rhone, where for nearly a century Christian 
missions have flourished. Between Marseilles and Smyrna there seems to have been 
a brisk trade, and Polycarp had sent Pothinus into Celtic Gaul at an early date 
as its evangelist. He had fixed his see at Lyons, when Irenaeus joined him as a 
presbyter, having been his fellow-pupil under Polycarp. There, under the "good 
Aurelius," as he is miscalled (a.d. 177), arose the terrible persecution which 
made "the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne" so memorable. It was during this 
persecution that Irenaeus was sent to Rome with letters of remonstrance against 
the rising pestilence of heresy; and he was probably the author of the account 
of the sufferings of the martyrs which is appended to their testimony. But he had the mortification of finding the Montanist heresy patronized by 
Eleutherus the Bishop of Rome; and there he met an old friend from the school of 
Polycarp, who had embraced the Valentinian heresy. We cannot doubt that to this 
visit we owe the lifelong struggle of Irenaeus against the heresies that now 
came in, like locusts, to devour the harvests of the Gospel. But let it be noted 
here, that, so far from being "the mother and mistress" of even the Western 
Churches, Rome herself is a mission of the Greeks; Southern Gaul is evangelized from Asia Minor, and Lyons checks the heretical 
tendencies of the Bishop at Rome. Ante-Nicene Christianity, and indeed the 
Church herself, appears in Greek costume which lasts through the synodical 
period; and Latin Christianity, when it begins to appear, is African, and not 
Roman. It is strange that those who have recorded this great historical fact 
have so little perceived its bearings upon Roman pretensions in the Middle Ages 
and modern times.</P>
<P>Returning to Lyons, our author found that the venerable Pothinus had closed 
his holy career by a martyr's death; and naturally Irenaeus became his 
successor. When the emissaries of heresy followed him, and began to disseminate 
their licentious practices and-foolish doctrines by the aid of "silly women," 
the great work of his life began. He condescended to study these diseases of the 
human mind like a wise physician; and, sickening as was the process of 
classifying and describing them, he made this also his laborious task, that he 
might enable others to withstand and to overcome them. The works he has left us 
are monuments of his fidelity to Christ, and to the charges of St. Paul, St. 
Peter, and St. Jude, whose solemn warnings now proved to be prophecies. No 
marvel that the great apostle, "night and day with tears," had forewarned the 
churches of "the grievous wolves" which were to make havoc of the fold.</P>
<P>If it shocks the young student of the virgin years of Christianity to find 
such a state of things, let him reflect that it was all foretold by Christ 
himself, and demonstrates the malice and power of the adversary. "An enemy hath 
done this," said the Master. The spirit that was then working "in the children 
of disobedience," now manifested itself. The awful visions of the Apocalypse 
began to be realized. It was now evident in what sense "the Prince of peace" had 
pronounced His mission, "not peace, but a sword." In short, it became a 
conspicuous fact, that the Church here on earth is "militant; "while, at the 
same time, there was seen to be a profound philosophy in the apostolic 
comment, "There must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made 
manifest." In the divine economy of Providence it was permitted that every form 
of heresy which was ever to infest the Church should now exhibit its essential 
principle, and attract the censures of the faithful. Thus testimony to primitive 
truth was secured and recorded: the language of catholic orthodoxy was developed 
and defined, and landmarks of faith were set up for perpetual memorial to all 
generations. It is a striking example of this divine economy, that the see of 
Rome was allowed to exhibit its fallibility very conspicuously at this time, and 
not only to receive the rebukes of Irenaeus, but to accept them as wholesome and 
necessary; so that the heresy of Eleutherus, and the spirit of Diotrephes in 
Victor, have enabled reformers ever since, and even in the darkest days of 
pontifical despotism, to testify against the manifold errors patronized by Rome. 
Hilary and other Gallicans have been strengthened by the example of Irenaeus, 
and by his faithful words of reproof and exhortation, to resist Rome, even down 
to our own times.</P>
<P>That the intolerable absurdities of Gnosticism should have gained so many 
disciples, and proved itself an adversary to be grappled with and not despised, 
throws light on the condition of the human mind under heathenism, even when it 
professed "knowledge" and "philosophy." The task of Irenaeus was twofold: ( 1 ) 
to render it impossible for any one to confound Gnosticism with Christianity, 
and (2) to make it impossible for such a monstrous system to survive, or ever to 
rise again. His task was a nauseous one; but never was the spirit enjoined by 
Scripture more patiently exhibited, nor with more entire success. If Julian had found Gnosticism just made to his hand, and powerful enough to 
suit his purposes, the whole history of his attempt to revive Paganism would 
have been widely different. Irenaeus demonstrated its essential unity with the 
old mythology, and with heathen systems of philosophy. If the fog and malaria 
that rose with the Day-star, and obscured it, were speedily dispersed, our 
author is largely to be identified with the radiance which flowed from the Sun 
of righteousness, and with the breath of the Spirit that banished them for 
ever.</P>
<P>The Episcopate of Irenaeus was distinguished by labours, "in season and out 
of season," for the evangelization of Southern Gaul; and he seems to have sent 
missionaries into other regions of what we now call France. In spite of Paganism 
and heresy, he rendered Lyons a Christian city; and Marcus seems to have 
retreated before his terrible castigation, taking himself off to regions beyond 
the Pyrenees. But the pacific name he bears, was rendered yet more illustrious 
by his interposition to compose the Easter Controversy, then threatening to 
impair, if not to destroy, the unity of the Church. The beautiful 
<I>concordat</I> between East and West, in which Polycarp and Anicetus had left 
the question, was now disturbed by Victor, Bishop of Rome, whose turbulent 
spirit would not accept the compromise of his predecessor. Irenaeus remonstrates 
with him in a catholic spirit, and overrules his impetuous temper. At the 
Council of Nice, the rule for the observance of Easter was finally settled by 
the whole Church; and the forbearing example of Irenaeus, no doubt contributed 
greatly to this happy result. The blessed peacemaker survived this great 
triumph, for a short time only, closing his life, like a true shepherd, with 
thousands of his flock, in the massacre (a.d. 202) stimulated by the wolfish 
Emperor Severus.</P>
<P>The Introductory Notice of the learned translators is as follows:- </P>
<P>The work of Irenaeus Against Heresies is one of the most precious remains of 
early Christian antiquity. It is devoted, on the one hand, to an account and 
refutation of those multiform Gnostic heresies which prevailed in the latter 
half of the second century; and, on the other hand, to an exposition and defence 
of the Catholic faith.</P>
<P>In the prosecution of this plan, the author divides his work into five books. 
The first of these contains a minute description of the tenets of the various 
heretical sects, with occasional brief remarks in illustration of their 
absurdity, and in confirmation of the truth to which they were opposed. In his 
second book, Irenaeus proceeds to a more complete demolition of those heresies 
which he has already explained, and argues at great length against them, on 
grounds principally of reason. The three remaining books set forth more directly 
the true doctrines of revelation, as being in utter antagonism to the views held 
by the Gnostic teachers. In the course of this argument, many passages of 
Scripture are quoted and commented on; many interesting statements are made, 
bearing on the rule of faith; and much important light is shed on the doctrines, 
held, as well as the practices observed, by the Church of the second 
century.</P>
<P>It may be made matter of regret, that so large a portion of the work of 
Irenaeus is given to an exposition of the manifold Gnostic speculations. Nothing 
more absurd than these has probably ever been imagined by rational beings. Some 
ingenious and learned men have indeed endeavoured to reconcile the wild theories 
of these heretics with the principles of reason; but, as Bishop Kaye remarks 
(<I>Eccl. Hist. of the Second and Third Centuries</I>, p. 524), "a more arduous 
or unpromising undertaking cannot well be conceived." The fundamental object of 
the Gnostic speculations was doubtless to solve the two grand problems of all 
religious philosophy, viz., How to account for the existence of evil; and, How 
to reconcile the finite with the infinite. But these ancient theorists were not 
more successful in grappling with such questions than have been their successors 
in modern times. And by giving loose reins to their imagination, they built up 
the most incongruous and ridiculous systems; while, by deserting the guidance of 
Scripture they were betrayed into the most pernicious and extravagant 
errors.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the patience of the reader is sorely tried, in following our 
author through those mazes of absurdity which he treads, in explaining and 
refuting these Gnostic speculations. This is especially felt in the perusal of 
the first two books, which, as has been said, are principally devoted to an 
exposition and subversion of the various heretical systems. But the vagaries of 
the human mind, however melancholy in themselves, are never altogether destitute 
of instruction. And in dealing with those set before us in this work, we have 
not only the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with the currents of thought 
prevalent in these early times, but we obtain much valuable information 
regarding the primitive Church, which, had it not been for these heretical 
schemes, might never have reached our day.</P>
<P>Not a little of what is contained in the following pages will seem almost 
unintelligible to the English reader. And it is scarcely more comprehensible to 
those who have pondered long on the original. We have inserted brief notes of 
explanation where these seemed specially necessary. But we have not thought it 
worth while to devote a great deal of space to the elucidation of those obscure 
Gnostic views which, in so many varying forms, are set forth in this work. For 
the same reason, we give here no account of the origin, history, and successive 
phases of Gnosticism. Those who wish to know the views of the learned on these 
points, may consult the writings of Neander, Baur, and others, among the 
Germans, or the lectures of Dr. Burton in English; while a succinct description 
of the whole matter will be found in the "Preliminary Observations on the 
Gnostic System," prefixed to Harvey's edition of Irenaeus.</P>
<P>The great work of Irenaeus, now for the first time translated into English, 
is unfortunately no longer extant in the original. It has come down to us only 
in an ancient Latin version, with the exception of the greater part of the first 
book, which has been preserved in the original Greek, through means of copious 
quotations made by Hippolytus and Epiphanius. The text, both Latin and Greek, is 
often most uncertain. Only three mss. of the work Against Heresies are at 
present known to exist. Others, however, were used in the earliest printed 
editions put forth by Erasmus. And as these codices were more ancient than any 
now available, it is greatly to be regretted that they have disappeared or 
perished. One of our difficulties throughout, has been to fix the readings we 
should adopt, especially in the first book. Varieties of reading, actual or 
conjectural, have been noted only when some point of special importance seemed 
to be involved.</P>
<P>After the text has been settled, according to the best judgment which can be 
formed, the work of translation remains; and that is, in this case, a matter of 
no small difficulty. Irenaeus, even in the original Greek, is often a very 
obscure writer. At times he expresses himself with remarkable clearness and 
terseness; but, upon the whole, his style is very involved and prolix. And the 
Latin version adds to these difficulties of the original, by being itself of the 
most barbarous character. In fact, it is often necessary to make a conjectural 
re-translation of it into Greek, in order to obtain some inkling of what the 
author wrote. Dodwell supposes this Latin version to have been made about the 
end of the fourth century; but as Tertullian seems to have used it, we must 
rather place it in the beginning of the third. Its author is unknown, but he was 
certainly little qualified for his task. We have endeavoured to give as close 
and accurate a translation of the work as possible, but there are not a few 
passages in which a guess can only be made as to the probable meaning.</P>
<P>Irenaeus had manifestly taken great pains to make himself acquainted with the 
various heretical systems which he describes. His mode of exposing and refuting 
these is generally very effective. It is plain that he possessed a good share of 
learning, and that he had a firm grasp of the doctrines of Scripture. Not 
unfrequently he indulges in a kind of sarcastic humour, while inveighing against 
the folly and impiety of the heretics. But at times he gives expression to very 
strange opinions. He is, for example, quite peculiar in imagining that our Lord 
lived to be an <I>old</I> man, and that His public ministry embraced at least 
<I>ten</I> years. But though, on these and some other points, the judgment of 
Irenaeus is clearly at fault, his work contains a vast deal of sound and 
valuable exposition of Scripture, in opposition to the fanciful systems of 
interpretation which prevailed in his day.</P>
<P>We possess only very scanty accounts of the personal history of Irenaeus. It 
has been generally supposed that he was a native of Smyrna, or some neighbouring 
city, in Asia Minor. Harvey, however, thinks that he was probably born in Syria, 
and removed in boyhood to Smyrna. He himself tells us (iii. 3, 4) that he was in 
early youth acquainted with Polycarp, the illustrious bishop of that city. A 
sort of clue is thus furnished as to the date of his birth. Dodwell supposes 
that he was born so early as a.d. 97, but this is clearly a mistake; and the 
general date assigned to his birth is somewhere between a.d. 120 and a.d. 
140.</P>
<P>It is certain that Irenaeus was bishop of Lyons, in France, during the latter 
quarter of the second century. The exact period or circumstances of his 
ordination cannot be determined. Eusebius states (Hist. Eccl., v. 4) that he 
was, while yet a presbyter, sent with a letter, from certain members of the 
Church of Lyons awaiting martyrdom, to Eleutherus, bishop of Rome; and that (v. 
5) he succeeded Pothinus as bishop of Lyons, probably about a.d. 177. His great 
work <I>Against Heresies</I> was, we learn, written during the episcopate of 
Eleutherus, that is, between a.d. 182 and a.d. 188, for Victor succeeded to the 
bishopric of Rome in a.d. 189. This new bishop of Rome took very harsh measures 
for enforcing uniformity throughout the Church as to the observance of the 
paschal solemnities. On account of the severity thus evinced, Irenaeus addressed 
to him a letter (only a fragment of which remains), warning him that if he 
persisted in the course on which he had entered, the effect would be to rend the 
Catholic Church in pieces. This letter had the desired result; and the question 
was more temperately debated. until finally settled by the Council of Nice.</P>
<P>The full title of the principal work of Irenaeus, as given by Eusebius (Hist. 
Eccl., v. 7), and indicated frequently by the author himself, was A Refutation 
and Subversion of Knowledge falsely so called, but it is generally referred to 
under the shorter title, Against Heresies. Several other smaller treatises are 
ascribed to Irenaeus; viz., <I>An Epistle to Florinus</I>, of which a small 
fragment has been preserved by Eusebius; a treatise <I>On the Valentinian 
Ogdoad</I>; a work called forth by the paschal controversy, entitled <I>On 
Schism</I>, and another <I>On Science</I>; all of which that remain will be 
found in our next volume of his writings. Irenaeus is supposed to have died 
about a.d. 202; but there is probably no real ground for the statement of 
Jerome, repeated by subsequent writers, that he suffered martyrdom, since 
neither Tertullian nor Eusebius, nor other early authorities, make any mention 
of such a fact.</P>
<P>As has been already stated, the first printed copy of our author was given to 
the world by Erasmus. This was in the year 1526. Between that date and 1571, a 
number of reprints were produced in both folio and octavo. All these contained 
merely the ancient barbarous Latin version, and were deficient towards the end 
by five entire chapters. These latter were supplied by the edition of Feuardent, 
Professor of Divinity at Paris, which was published in 1575, and went through 
six subsequent editions. Previously to this, however, another had been set forth 
by Gallasius, a minister of Geneva, which contained the first portions of the 
Greek text from Epiphanius. Then, in 1702, came the edition of Grabe, a learned 
Prussian, who had settled in England. It was published at Oxford, and contained 
considerable additions to the Greek text, with fragments. Ten years after this 
there appeared the important Paris edition by the Benedictine monk Massuet. This 
was reprinted at Venice in the year 1724, in two thin folio volumes, and again 
at Paris in a large octavo, by the Abbe Migne, in 1857. A German edition was 
published by Stieren in 1853. In the year 1857 there was also brought out a 
Cambridge edition, by the Rev. Wigan Harvey, in two octavo volumes. The two 
principal features of this edition are: the additions which have been made to 
the Greek text from the recently discovered <I><FONT 
face="Semitica Dict">Philosophoumena</FONT></I> of Hippolytus; and the further 
addition of thirty-two fragments of a Syriac version of the Greek text of 
Irenaeus, culled from the Nitrian collection of Syriac mss. in the British 
Museum. These fragments are of considerable interest, and in some instances 
rectify the readings of the barbarous Latin version, where, without such aid, it 
would have been unintelligible. The edition of Harvey will be found constantly 
referred to in the notes appended to our translation. </P>
