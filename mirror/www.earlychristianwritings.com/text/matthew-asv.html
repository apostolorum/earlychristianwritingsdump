<P><A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; <A name=C1V13><FONT

Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 
<P><A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So all the generations from Abraham 
unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to 
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the 
Christ fourteen generations. 
<P><A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on 
this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came 
together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. <A name=C1V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Joseph her 
husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, 
was minded to put her away privily. <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he thought on these things, 
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou 
son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she shall bring forth a son; and 
thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from 
their sins. <A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now all this is come to pass, that it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, the virgin shall be with child, 
and shall bring forth a son, 
<P>&nbsp;And they shall call his name Immanuel; 
<P>which is, being interpreted, God with us. <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Joseph arose 
from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto 
him his wife; <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and knew her not till she had brought 
forth a son: and he called his name JESUS. 
<P>
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of 
Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to 
Jerusalem, saying, <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Where is he that is born King of the 
Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him. <A 
name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <A 
name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired 
of them where the Christ should be born. <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of 
Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, 
<P>&nbsp;Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: 
<P>&nbsp;For out of thee shall come forth a governor, 
<P>&nbsp;Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel. 
<P><A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, 
and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared. <A name=C2V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sent them to 
Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and 
when ye have found <I>him,</I> bring me word, that I also may come and worship 
him. <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, having heard the king, went 
their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till 
it came and stood over where the young child was. <A name=C2V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they saw 
the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came into 
the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and 
worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold 
and frankincense and myrrh. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And being warned <I>of God</I> in a 
dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country 
another way. 
<P><A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they were departed, behold, an 
angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the 
young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell 
thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. <A name=C2V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he arose and 
took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt; <A 
name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and was there until the death of Herod: 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, 
saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son. 
<P><A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Herod, when he saw that he was 
mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the 
male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two 
years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the 
Wise-men. <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then was fulfilled that which was 
spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A voice was heard in Ramah, 
<P>&nbsp;Weeping and great mourning, 
<P>&nbsp;Rachel weeping for her children; 
<P>&nbsp;And she would not be comforted, because they are not. 
<P><A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Herod was dead, behold, an 
angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, <A 
name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Arise and take the young child and his 
mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young 
child's life. <A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he arose and took the young child 
and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <A name=C2V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he heard 
that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was 
afraid to go thither; and being warned <I>of God</I> in a dream, he withdrew 
into the parts of Galilee, <A name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and came and dwelt in a city called 
Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that 
he should be called a Nazarene. 
<P>
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in those days cometh John the 
Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, <A name=C3V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Repent ye; for the 
kingdom of heaven is at hand. <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this is he that was spoken of 
through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
<P>&nbsp;Make ye ready the way of the Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;Make his paths straight. 
<P><A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now John himself had his raiment of 
camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts 
and wild honey. <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and 
all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan; <A name=C3V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they were 
baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. <A name=C3V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he saw many 
of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye 
offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <A 
name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of 
repentance: <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and think not to say within yourselves, 
We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these 
stones to raise up children unto Abraham. <A name=C3V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And even now the 
axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth 
good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. <A name=C3V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I indeed baptize 
you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, 
whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and 
<I>in</I> fire: <A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whose fan is in his hand, and he will 
thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the 
garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. 
<P><A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the 
Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But John would have hindered him, 
saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? <A 
name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus answering said unto him, 
Suffer <I>it</I> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then 
he suffereth him. <A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus when he was baptized, went up 
straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw 
the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him; <A name=C3V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and lo, a voice out 
of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into 
the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. <A name=C4V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had 
fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered. <A name=C4V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the tempter came 
and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become 
bread. <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he answered and said, It is written, 
Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God. <A name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the devil taketh him into the holy

If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: 
<P>and, 
<P>&nbsp;On their hands they shall bear thee up, 
<P>&nbsp;Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
<P><A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God. <A name=C4V8><FONT

taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of 
the world, and the glory of them; <A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. <A name=C4V10><FONT

thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. <A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

angels came and ministered unto him. 
<P><A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee; <A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali: <A

spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;Galilee of the Gentiles, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;Saw a great light, 
<P>&nbsp;And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, 
<P>&nbsp;To them did light spring up. 
<P><A name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
<P><A name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a 
net into the sea; for they were fishers. <A name=C4V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

me, and I will make you fishers of men. <A name=C4V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

followed him. <A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

other brethren, James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the 
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. <A

their father, and followed him. 
<P><A name=C4V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and 
healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people. <A

all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers 
diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he 
healed them. <A name=C4V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,

unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no

great in the kingdom of heaven. <A name=C5V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever

shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire. <A

thy brother hath aught against thee, <A name=C5V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

shalt not commit adultery: <A name=C5V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in 
his heart. <A name=C5V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if thy right eye causeth thee to

divorcement: <A name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but I say unto you, that every one that 
putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an 
adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth 
adultery. 
<P><A name=C5V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Lord thine oaths: <A name=C5V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; <A name=C5V35><FONT

be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil

not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the

<P><A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that 
they shall be heard for their much speaking. <A name=C6V8><FONT

the fall thereof. 
<P><A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching: <A

<P>
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made

<P><A name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, <A name=C8V6><FONT

he saith unto him, I will come and heal him. <A name=C8V8><FONT

answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; 
but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed. <A name=C8V9><FONT

under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he 
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he 
doeth it. <A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great 
faith, no, not in Israel. <A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and 
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: <A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

thy way; as thou hast believed, <I>so</I> be it done unto thee. And the servant 
was healed in that hour. 
<P><A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him. <A

unto him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, 
and healed all that were sick: <A name=C8V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Himself took our infirmities, and 
bare our diseases. 
<P><A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

about him, he gave commandments to depart unto the other side. <A

him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. <A name=C8V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus saith 
unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven <I>have</I> nests; 
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. <A name=C8V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And another of the 
disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. <A

and leave the dead to bury their own dead. 
<P><A name=C8V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

his disciples followed him. <A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was 
asleep. <A name=C8V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came to him, and awoke him, 
saying, Save, Lord; we perish. <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, Why are ye 
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; 
and there was a great calm. <A name=C8V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the men marvelled, saying, What 
manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? 
<P><A name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was come to the other side 
into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, 
coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by 
that way. <A name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, they cried out, saying, 
What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment 
us before the time? <A name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was afar off from them a herd 
of many swine feeding. <A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine. <A name=C8V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd 
rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters. <A 
name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that fed them fled, and went 
away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were 
possessed with demons. <A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, all the city came out to 
meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought <I>him</I> that he would depart 
from their borders. 
<P>
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

over, and came into his own city. <A name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the 
sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven. <A 
name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. <A 
name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? <A 
name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? <A 
name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins 
(then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up 
unto thy house. <A name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<A name=C9V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men. 
<P><A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as Jesus passed by from thence, he 
saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, 
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. 
<P><A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat 
in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus 
and his disciples. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the Pharisees saw it, they 
said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners? 
<A name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he heard it, he said, They 
that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. <A

size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But go ye and learn what <I>this</I> 
meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the 
righteous, but sinners. 
<P><A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? <A 
name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons 
of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days 
will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they 
fast. <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the 
garment, and a worse rent is made. <A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither do <I>men</I> put new wine into 
old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins 
perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved. 
<P><A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now 
dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. <A

<I>so did</I> his disciples. <A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: 
<A name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

but touch his garment, I shall be made whole. <A name=C9V22><FONT

and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. 
And the woman was made whole from that hour. <A name=C9V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus came 
into the ruler's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a 
tumult, <A name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he said, Give place: for the damsel is 
not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. <A name=C9V25><FONT

that land. 
<P><A name=C9V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

David. <A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able 
to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. <A name=C9V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then touched he 
their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you. <A

size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus 
strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. <A name=C9V31><FONT

forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land. 
<P><A name=C9V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon. <A name=C9V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the demon 
was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was 
never so seen in Israel. <A name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Pharisees said, By the prince 
of the demons casteth he out demons. 
<P><A name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the 
kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. <A

moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as 
sheep not having a shepherd. <A name=C9V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few. <A name=C9V38><FONT

the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest. 
<P>
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. 
<P><A name=C10V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On that day went Jesus out of the 
house, and sat by the sea side. <A name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were gathered unto him great 
multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood 
on the beach. <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake to them many things in 
parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow; <A name=C13V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and as he sowed, 
some <I>seeds</I> fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them: <A 
name=C13V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and others fell upon the rocky places, 
where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had 
no deepness of earth: <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when the sun was risen, they were 
scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. <A name=C13V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And others fell 
upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them: <A name=C13V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and others fell 
upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some 
thirty. <A name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that hath ears, let him hear. 
<P><A name=C13V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the disciples came, and said unto 
him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? <A name=C13V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered 
and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of 
heaven, but to them it is not given. <A name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever hath, to him shall be 
given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be 
taken away even that which he hath. <A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore speak I to them in parables; 
because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they 
understand. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And unto them is fulfilled the 
prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, 
<P>&nbsp;By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; 
<P>&nbsp;And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C13V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this people's heart is waxed 
gross, 
<P>&nbsp;And their ears are dull of hearing, 
<P>&nbsp;And their eyes they have closed; 
<P>&nbsp;Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, 
<P>&nbsp;And hear with their ears, 
<P>&nbsp;And understand with their heart, 
<P>&nbsp;And should turn again, 
<P>&nbsp;And I should heal them. 
<P><A name=C13V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

see; and your ears, for they hear. <A name=C13V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For verily I say unto you, that many 
prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them 
not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. <A

<A name=C13V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When any one heareth the word of the 
kingdom, and understandeth it not, <I>then</I> cometh the evil <I>one</I>, and 
snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown 
by the way side. <A name=C13V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that was sown upon the rocky 
places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; 
<A name=C13V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yet hath he not root in himself, but 
endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the 
word, straightway he stumbleth. <A name=C13V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that was sown among the thorns, 
this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the 
deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. <A 
name=C13V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that was sown upon the good 
ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily 
beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
<P><A name=C13V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Another parable set he before them, 
saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his 
field: <A name=C13V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but while men slept, his enemy came 
and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away. <A name=C13V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the blade 
sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. <A 
name=C13V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the servants of the householder 
came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence 
then hath it tares? <A name=C13V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, An enemy hath 
done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather 
them up? <A name=C13V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye 
gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them. <A name=C13V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let both grow 
together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the 
reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but 
gather the wheat into my barn. 
<P><A name=C13V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Another parable set he before them, 
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man 
took, and sowed in his field: <A name=C13V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which indeed is less than all seeds; 
but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that 
the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof. 
<P><A name=C13V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Another parable spake he unto them; 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three 
measures of meal, till it was all leavened. 
<P><A name=C13V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All these things spake Jesus in 
parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them: 
<A name=C13V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken through the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;I will open my mouth in parables; 
<P>&nbsp;I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. 
<P><A name=C13V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then he left the multitudes, and went 
into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the 
parable of the tares of the field. <A name=C13V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered and said, He that 
soweth the good seed is the Son of man; <A name=C13V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the field is the world; and the 
good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the 
evil <I>one</I>; <A name=C13V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the enemy that sowed them is the 
devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels. <A 
name=C13V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As therefore the tares are gathered up 
and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world. <A 
name=C13V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Son of man shall send forth his 
angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause 
stumbling, and them that do iniquity, <A name=C13V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and shall cast them into the furnace 
of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. <A 
name=C13V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then shall the righteous shine forth 
as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear. 
<P><A name=C13V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a 
treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he 
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 
<P><A name=C13V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like 
unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: <A name=C13V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and having found 
one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. 
<P><A name=C13V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like 
unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: <A 
name=C13V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which, when it was filled, they drew 
up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the 
bad they cast away. <A name=C13V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So shall it be in the end of the 
world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the 
righteous, <A name=C13V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and shall cast them into the furnace 
of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 
<P><A name=C13V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Have ye understood all these things? 
They say unto him, Yea. <A name=C13V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Therefore every 
scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man 
that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and 
old. 
<P><A name=C13V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, when Jesus had 
finished these parables, he departed thence. 
<P><A name=C13V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And coming into his own country he 
taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, 
Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? <A name=C13V55><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Is not this the 
carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and 
Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? <A name=C13V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his sisters, are they not all with 
us? Whence then hath this man all these things? <A name=C13V57><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were 
offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save 
in his own country, and in his own house. <A name=C13V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he did not 
many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 
<P>
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At that season Herod the tetrarch heard 
the report concerning Jesus, <A name=C14V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said unto his servants, This is 
John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work 
in him. <A name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Herod had laid hold on John, and 
bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's 
wife. <A name=C14V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For John said unto him, It is not 
lawful for thee to have her. <A name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he would have put him to 
death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. <A 
name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Herod's birthday came, the 
daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod. <A name=C14V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whereupon he 
promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask. <A name=C14V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she, being put 
forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the 
Baptist. <A name=C14V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the king was grieved; but for the 
sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be 
given; <A name=C14V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he sent and beheaded John in the 
prison. <A name=C14V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his head was brought on a platter, 
and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. <A name=C14V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his disciples 
came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus. 
<P><A name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Jesus heard <I>it</I>, he 
withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes 
heard <I>thereof,</I> they followed him on foot from the cities. <A 
name=C14V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came forth, and saw a great 
multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. <A 
name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when even was come, the disciples 
came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the 
multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food. <A 
name=C14V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said unto them, They have no 
need to go away; give ye them to eat. <A name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they say unto him, We have here 
but five loaves, and two fishes. <A name=C14V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Bring them hither to me. 
<A name=C14V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he commanded the multitudes to sit 
down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking 
up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and 
the disciples to the multitudes. <A name=C14V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they all ate, and were filled: and 
they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
<A name=C14V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that did eat were about five 
thousand men, besides women and children. 
<P><A name=C14V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway he constrained the 
disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till 
he should send the multitudes away. <A name=C14V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after he had sent the multitudes 
away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was 
there alone. <A name=C14V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the boat was now in the midst of 
the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. <A 
name=C14V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in the fourth watch of the night 
he came unto them, walking upon the sea. <A name=C14V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the 
disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; 
and they cried out for fear. <A name=C14V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But straightway Jesus spake unto them, 
saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. <A name=C14V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter answered 
him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto the upon the waters. <A 
name=C14V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Come. And Peter went down 
from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus. <A name=C14V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he saw 
the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save 
me. <A name=C14V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And immediately Jesus stretched forth 
his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, 
wherefore didst thou doubt? <A name=C14V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were gone up into the 
boat, the wind ceased. <A name=C14V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that were in the boat 
worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. 
<P><A name=C14V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had crossed over, they 
came to the land, unto Gennesaret. <A name=C14V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the men of that place knew 
him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that 
were sick, <A name=C14V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they besought him that they might 
only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole. 
<P>
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem 
Pharisees and scribes, saying, <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? <A

have made void the word of God because of your tradition. <A name=C15V7><FONT

did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;But their heart is far from me. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;Teaching <I>as their</I> doctrines the precepts of men. 
<P><A name=C15V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and said unto them, Hear, and understand: <A name=C15V11><FONT

entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the 
mouth, this defileth the man. <A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? 
<A name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. <A name=C15V14><FONT

Declare unto us the parable. <A name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man. <A

<P><A name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on 
me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon. <A

his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after 
us. <A name=C15V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<A name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her 
daughter was healed from that hour.

multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and 
they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them: <A name=C15V31><FONT

<P><A name=C15V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue 
with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away 
fasting, lest haply they faint on the way. <A name=C15V33><FONT

so great a multitude? <A name=C15V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
<A name=C15V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan. 

<P>
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven. <A name=C16V2><FONT

said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, <I>It will be</I> fair weather: for 
the heaven is red. <A name=C16V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in the morning, <I>It will be</I> 
foul weather to-day: for the heaven is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern 
the face of the heaven; but ye cannot <I>discern</I> the signs of the times. <A

evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be

<P><A name=C16V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

side and forgot to take bread. <A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <A name=C16V7><FONT

among themselves, saying, We took no bread. <A name=C16V8><FONT

perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, 
because ye have no bread? <A name=C16V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <A name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and 
Sadducees. 
<P><A name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son 
of man is? <A name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that I am? <A name=C16V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. <A name=C16V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answered 
and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath 
not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. <A name=C16V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I also say 
unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and 
the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. <A name=C16V19><FONT

thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they should tell no man that he was the Christ. 
<P><A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of 
the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be 
raised up. <A name=C16V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter took him, and began to 
rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee. <A

size=-1><SUP>16:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he turned, and said unto Peter, 
Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest 
not the things of God, but the things of men. <A name=C16V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then said Jesus 
unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and 
take up his cross, and follow me. <A name=C16V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever would save his life 
shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. <A

he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in 
exchange for his life? <A name=C16V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Son of man shall come in the

according to his deeds. <A name=C16V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>
<P><A name=C17V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. 
<A name=C17V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Moses and Elijah talking with him. <A name=C17V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three 
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. <A

This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. <A

fell on their face, and were sore afraid. <A name=C17V7><FONT

their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only. 
<P><A name=C17V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of man be risen from the dead. <A name=C17V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come? <A name=C17V11><FONT

and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things: <A

come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. 
Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them. <A name=C17V13><FONT

the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. 
<P><A name=C17V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

I bear with you? bring him hither to me. <A name=C17V18><FONT

him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.

them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith

word may be established. <A name=C18V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if he refuse to hear them, tell it 
unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee 
as the Gentile and the publican. <A name=C18V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto you, what things

ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. <A name=C18V19><FONT

you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they 
shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven. <A

together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. 
<P><A name=C18V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, 
how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? 
<A name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto 
thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven. <A name=C18V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore is the 
kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with 
his servants. <A name=C18V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had begun to reckon, one 
was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents. <A name=C18V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But forasmuch as 
he had not <I>wherewith</I> to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his 
wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. <A 
name=C18V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The servant therefore fell down and 
worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <A 
name=C18V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the lord of that servant, being 
moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. <A 
name=C18V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But that servant went out, and found 
one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he laid hold 
on him, and took <I>him</I> by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest. <A 
name=C18V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So his fellow-servant fell down and 
besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. <A 
name=C18V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he would not: but went and cast 
him into prison, till he should pay that which was due. <A name=C18V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when his 
fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told 
unto their lord all that was done. <A name=C18V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then his lord called him unto him, and 
saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou 
besoughtest me: <A name=C18V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>shouldest not thou also have had mercy 
on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee? <A name=C18V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his lord was 
wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. 
<A name=C18V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So shall also my heavenly Father do 
unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts. 
<P>
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass when Jesus had 
finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of 
Judaea beyond the Jordan; <A name=C19V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and great multitudes followed him; and 
he healed them there. 
<P><A name=C19V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came unto him Pharisees, 
trying him, and saying, Is it lawful <I>for a man</I> to put away his wife for 
every cause? <A name=C19V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered and said, Have ye not 
read, that he who made <I>them</I> from the beginning made them male and female, 
<A name=C19V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, For this cause shall a man 
leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall 
become one flesh? <A name=C19V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So that they are no more two, but one 
flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. <A 
name=C19V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They say unto him, Why then did Moses 
command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put <I>her</I> away? <A 
name=C19V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your 
wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so. <A name=C19V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I say unto you, 
Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry 
another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away 
committeth adultery. <A name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples say unto him, If the 
case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. <A 
name=C19V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said unto them, Not all men can 
receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. <A name=C19V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there are 
eunuchs, that were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that 
were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs 
for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive 
it. 
<P><A name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then were there brought unto him 
little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the 
disciples rebuked them. <A name=C19V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said, Suffer the little 
children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the 
kingdom of heaven. <A name=C19V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he laid his hands on them, and 
departed thence. 
<P><A name=C19V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, one came to him and said, 
Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? <A 
name=C19V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, Why askest thou 
me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest 
enter into life, keep the commandments. <A name=C19V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus 
said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, 
Thou shalt not bear false witness, <A name=C19V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. <A name=C19V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The young man saith unto him, All 
these things have I observed: what lack I yet? <A name=C19V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto 
him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the 
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. <A 
name=C19V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the young man heard the 
saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions. 
<P><A name=C19V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto his disciples, 
Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of 
heaven. <A name=C19V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again I say unto you, It is easier 
for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the 
kingdom of God. <A name=C19V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the disciples heard it, they 
were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved? <A name=C19V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus looking 
upon <I>them</I> said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all 
things are possible. <A name=C19V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then answered Peter and said unto him, 
Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have? <A 
name=C19V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say 
unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man 
shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <A name=C19V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And every one that hath left houses, 
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my

<P>
<P><A name=C20V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto 
a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers 
into his vineyard. <A name=C20V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had agreed with the 
laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard. <A

size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went out about the third hour, 
and saw others standing in the marketplace idle; <A name=C20V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to them he 
said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And 
they went their way. <A name=C20V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again he went out about the sixth and 
the ninth hour, and did likewise. <A name=C20V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And about the eleventh <I>hour</I> he 
went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here 
all the day idle? <A name=C20V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They say unto him, Because no man hath 
hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard. <A name=C20V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when even was 
come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and 
pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. <A name=C20V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they came 
that <I>were hired</I> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a 
shilling. <A name=C20V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the first came, they supposed 
that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling. 
<A name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they received it, they 
murmured against the householder, <A name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, These last have spent 
<I>but</I> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the 
burden of the day and the scorching heat. <A name=C20V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he answered 
and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with 
me for a shilling? <A name=C20V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take up that which is thine, and go 
thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee. <A 
name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Is it not lawful for me to do what I 
will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good? <A 
name=C20V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the last shall be first, and the 
first last. 
<P><A name=C20V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them, 
<A name=C20V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall 
condemn him to death, <A name=C20V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and shall deliver him unto the 
Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be 
raised up. 
<P><A name=C20V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then came to him the mother of the 
sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping <I>him</I>, and asking a certain 
thing of him. <A name=C20V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto her, What wouldest 
thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy 
right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom. <A name=C20V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus answered 
and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about 
to drink? They say unto him, We are able. <A name=C20V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saith unto 
them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on 
<I>my</I> left hand, is not mine to give; but <I>it is for them</I> for whom it 
hath been prepared of my Father. <A name=C20V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

moved with indignation concerning the two brethren. <A name=C20V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus called 
them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over 
them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. <A name=C20V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not so shall it be 
among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; <A

<P><A name=C20V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

great multitude followed him. <A name=C20V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David. <A name=C20V31><FONT

saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David. <A name=C20V32><FONT

followed him. 
<P>
<P><A name=C21V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

put on them their garments; and he sat thereon. <A name=C21V8><FONT

him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed

all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this? <A name=C21V11><FONT

<P><A name=C21V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

indignation, <A name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, 
Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig

Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do

thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done. <A name=C21V22><FONT

the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching,

authority? <A name=C21V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you 
by what authority I do these things. <A name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall

the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. <A

that ye might believe him.

read in the scriptures, 
<P>&nbsp;The stone which the builders rejected, 
<P>&nbsp;The same was made the head of the corner;

<P><A name=C22V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

parables unto them, saying, <A name=C22V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son, <A name=C22V3><FONT

come. <A name=C22V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen

feast. <A name=C22V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise; <A name=C22V6><FONT

hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. <A

armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. <A

wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy. <A name=C22V9><FONT

unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the 
marriage feast. <A name=C22V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and the wedding was filled with guests. <A name=C22V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment: <A

Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be 
the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. <A name=C22V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C22V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

counsel how they might ensnare him in <I>his</I> talk. <A name=C22V16><FONT

him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art 
true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou 
regardest not the person of men. <A name=C22V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? <A name=C22V18><FONT

<P><A name=C22V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him, <A

die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed 
unto his brother. <A name=C22V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. 
<A name=C22V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven. <A

<P><A name=C22V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together. <A

commandment in the law? <A name=C22V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
mind. <A name=C22V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. <A name=C22V40><FONT

commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets. 
<P><A name=C22V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

whose son is he? They say unto him, <I>The son</I> of David. <A

David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C22V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he his son? <A name=C22V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C23V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. <A name=C25V29><FONT

size=-1><SUP>26:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the disciples saw it, they had 
indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? <A name=C26V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this 
<I>ointment</I> might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. <A 
name=C26V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus perceiving it said unto 
them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. <A 
name=C26V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye have the poor always with you; 
but me ye have not always. <A name=C26V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For in that she poured this ointment 
upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. <A name=C26V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto 
you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also 
which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. 
<P><A name=C26V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then one of the twelve, who was called 
Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, <A name=C26V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, What are 
ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto 
him thirty pieces of silver. <A name=C26V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And from that time he sought 
opportunity to deliver him <I>unto them.</I> 
<P><A name=C26V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the first <I>day</I> of 
unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we 
make ready for thee to eat the passover? <A name=C26V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Go 
into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at 
hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. <A name=C26V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the disciples 
did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
<P><A name=C26V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when even was come, he was sitting 
at meat with the twelve disciples; <A name=C26V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and as they were eating, he said, 
Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. <A name=C26V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were 
exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord? <A 
name=C26V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered and said, He that 
dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. <A 
name=C26V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Son of man goeth, even as it is 
written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! 
good were it for that man if he had not been born. <A name=C26V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Judas, who 
betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast 
said. 
<P><A name=C26V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they were eating, Jesus took 
bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, 
eat; this is my body. <A name=C26V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took a cup, and gave thanks, 
and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; <A name=C26V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for this is my 
blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins. <A 
name=C26V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say unto you, I shall not drink 
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with 
you in my Father's kingdom. 
<P><A name=C26V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had sung a hymn, they 
went out unto the mount of Olives. 
<P><A name=C26V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye 
shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the 
shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. <A 
name=C26V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But after I am raised up, I will go 
before you into Galilee. <A name=C26V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter answered and said unto him, 
If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended. <A name=C26V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto 
him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt 
deny me thrice. <A name=C26V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter saith unto him, Even if I must 
die with thee, <I>yet</I> will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the 
disciples. 
<P><A name=C26V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a 
place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go 
yonder and pray. <A name=C26V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took with him Peter and the two 
sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. <A 
name=C26V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith he unto them, My soul is 
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me. <A 
name=C26V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went forward a little, and fell 
on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass 
away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. <A 
name=C26V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cometh unto the disciples, and 
findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me 
one hour? <A name=C26V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into 
temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. <A 
name=C26V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again a second time he went away, and 
prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will 
be done. <A name=C26V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came again and found them 
sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <A name=C26V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he left them again, and went away, 
and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. <A name=C26V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then cometh he to 
the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, 
the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
<A name=C26V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Arise, let us be going: behold, he is 
at hand that betrayeth me. 
<P><A name=C26V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one 
of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from 
the chief priest and elders of the people. <A name=C26V48><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he that 
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take 
him. <A name=C26V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway he came to Jesus, and 
said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. <A name=C26V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, 
<I>do</I> that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, 
and took him. <A name=C26V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, one of them that were with 
Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the 
high priest, and struck off his ear. <A name=C26V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up 
again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish 
with the sword. <A name=C26V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech 
my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? <A 
name=C26V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How then should the scriptures be 
fulfilled that thus it must be? <A name=C26V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In that hour said Jesus to the 
multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize 
me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not. <A name=C26V56><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But all this is 
come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all 
the disciples left him, and fled. 
<P><A name=C26V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that had taken Jesus led him 
away to <I>the house of</I> Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the 
elders were gathered together. <A name=C26V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter followed him afar off, unto 
the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see 
the end. <A name=C26V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests and the whole 
council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; <A 
name=C26V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they found it not, though many 
false witnesses came. But afterward came two, <A name=C26V61><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, This man 
said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. <A 
name=C26V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the high priest stood up, and said 
unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
<A name=C26V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus held his peace. And the high 
priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether 
thou art the Christ, the Son of God. <A name=C26V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: 
nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at 
the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. <A 
name=C26V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the high priest rent his 
garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of 
witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: <A name=C26V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>what think ye? 
They answered and said, He is worthy of death. <A name=C26V67><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then did they spit 
in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands, <A 
name=C26V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:68</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: 
who is he that struck thee? 
<P><A name=C26V69><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:69</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Peter was sitting without in the 
court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the 
Galilaean. <A name=C26V70><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he denied before them all, saying, 
I know not what thou sayest. <A name=C26V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was gone out into the 
porch, another <I>maid</I> saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This 
man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. <A name=C26V72><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:72</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again he denied with an oath, I 
know not the man. <A name=C26V73><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:73</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after a little while they that 
stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art <I>one</I> of them; 
for thy speech maketh thee known. <A name=C26V74><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:74</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then began he to curse and to swear, I 
know not the man. And straightway the cock crew. <A name=C26V75><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:75</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter 
remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny 
me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. 
<P>
<P><A name=C27V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when morning was come, all the 
chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him 
to death: <A name=C27V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they bound him, and led him away, 
and delivered him up to Pilate the governor. 
<P><A name=C27V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he 
saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces 
of silver to the chief priests and elders, <A name=C27V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, I have 
sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see 
thou <I>to it</I>. <A name=C27V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cast down the pieces of silver 
into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. <A 
name=C27V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief priests took the pieces 
of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is 
the price of blood. <A name=C27V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they took counsel, and bought with 
them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. <A name=C27V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore that 
field was called, the field of blood, unto this day. <A name=C27V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then was fulfilled 
that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the 
thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom <I>certain</I> 
of the children of Israel did price; <A name=C27V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they gave them for the potter's 
field, as the Lord appointed me. 
<P><A name=C27V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Jesus stood before the governor: 
and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus 
said unto him, Thou sayest. <A name=C27V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was accused by the chief 
priests and elders, he answered nothing. <A name=C27V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith Pilate 
unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? <A 
name=C27V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he gave him no answer, not even to 
one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. <A name=C27V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now at the feast 
the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they 
would. <A name=C27V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they had then a notable prisoner, 
called Barabbas. <A name=C27V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore they were gathered 
together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, 
or Jesus who is called Christ? <A name=C27V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he knew that for envy they had 
delivered him up. <A name=C27V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while he was sitting on the 
judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that 
righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of 
him. <A name=C27V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests and the elders 
persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
<A name=C27V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the governor answered and said 
unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, 
Barabbas. <A name=C27V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate saith unto them, What then 
shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. 
<A name=C27V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Why, what evil hath he 
done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified. <A 
name=C27V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when Pilate saw that he prevailed 
nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his 
hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous 
man; see ye <I>to it</I>. <A name=C27V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the people answered and said, 
His blood <I>be</I> on us, and on our children. <A name=C27V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then released he 
unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified. 
<P><A name=C27V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the soldiers of the governor took 
Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band. <A 
name=C27V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they stripped him, and put on him 
a scarlet robe. <A name=C27V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they platted a crown of thorns and 
put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before 
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! <A name=C27V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they spat upon 
him, and took the reed and smote him on the head. <A name=C27V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had 
mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and 
led him away to crucify him. 
<P><A name=C27V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they came out, they found a man 
of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go <I>with them</I>, that he 
might bear his cross. 
<P><A name=C27V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were come unto a place called 
Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull, <A name=C27V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they gave him wine 
to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink. <A 
name=C27V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had crucified him, they 
parted his garments among them, casting lots; <A name=C27V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they sat and 
watched him there. <A name=C27V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they set up over his head his 
accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <A name=C27V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then are there 
crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left. <A 
name=C27V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that passed by railed on him, 
wagging their heads, <A name=C27V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saying, Thou that destroyest the 
temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, 
come down from the cross. <A name=C27V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In like manner also the chief priests 
mocking <I>him</I>, with the scribes and elders, said, <A name=C27V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saved others; 
himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the 
cross, and we will believe on him. <A name=C27V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He trusteth on God; let him deliver 
him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God. <A 
name=C27V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the robbers also that were 
crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach. 
<P><A name=C27V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now from the sixth hour there was 
darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. <A name=C27V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And about the 
ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? 
that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <A name=C27V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some of them 
stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah. <A 
name=C27V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway one of them ran, and 
took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to 
drink. <A name=C27V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the rest said, Let be; let us see 
whether Elijah cometh to save him. <A name=C27V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus cried again with a loud 
voice, and yielded up his spirit. <A name=C27V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, the veil of the temple was 
rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks 
were rent; <A name=C27V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the tombs were opened; and many 
bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; <A name=C27V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and coming forth 
out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and 
appeared unto many. <A name=C27V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the centurion, and they that were 
with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were 
done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. <A 
name=C27V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And many women were there beholding 
from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: <A 
name=C27V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>among whom was Mary Magdalene, and 
Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
<P><A name=C27V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when even was come, there came a 
rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: <A 
name=C27V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>this man went to Pilate, and asked for 
the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up. <A name=C27V59><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Joseph took 
the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <A name=C27V60><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and laid it in his 
own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to 
the door of the tomb, and departed. <A name=C27V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the 
other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. 
<P><A name=C27V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the morrow, which is <I>the 
day</I> after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered 
together unto Pilate, <A name=C27V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Sir, we remember that that 
deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again. <A 
name=C27V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Command therefore that the sepulchre 
be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him 
away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error 
will be worse than the first. <A name=C27V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a 
guard: go, make it <I>as</I> sure as ye can. <A name=C27V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they went, and 
made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them. 
<P>
<P><A name=C28V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now late on the sabbath day, as it 
began to dawn toward the first <I>day</I> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and 
the other Mary to see the sepulchre. <A name=C28V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, there was a great 
earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled 
away the stone, and sat upon it. <A name=C28V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His appearance was as lightning, and 
his raiment white as snow: <A name=C28V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and for fear of him the watchers did 
quake, and became as dead men. <A name=C28V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel answered and said unto 
the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified. 
<A name=C28V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is not here; for he is risen, even 
as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. <A name=C28V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And go quickly, and 
tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into 
Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. <A name=C28V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they departed 
quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples 
word. <A name=C28V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All 
hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. <A 
name=C28V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: 
go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 
<P><A name=C28V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now while they were going, behold, 
some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the 
things that were come to pass. <A name=C28V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were assembled with the 
elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers, <A 
name=C28V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Say ye, His disciples came by 
night, and stole him away while we slept. <A name=C28V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if this come 
to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. <A 
name=C28V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they took the money, and did as 
they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, <I>and 
continueth</I> until this day. 
<P><A name=C28V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the eleven disciples went into 
Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. <A name=C28V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they saw 
him, they worshipped <I>him</I>; but some doubted. <A name=C28V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus came to 
them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in 
heaven and on earth. <A name=C28V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Go ye therefore, and make disciples of 
all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and 
of the Holy Spirit: <A name=C28V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>teaching them to observe all things 
whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of 
the world.
