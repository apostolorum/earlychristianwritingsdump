<H1>The Gospel According to Luke </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Since many have undertaken to set in 
order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, 
<A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even as those who from the beginning 
were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us, <A 
name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>it 
seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from 
the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; <A 
name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that 
you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed. 

<P><A name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was in the days of Herod, the king 
of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. 
He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <A 
name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They 
were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and 
ordinances of the Lord. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they had no child, because Elizabeth 
was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. <A name=C1V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it happened, 
while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division, 
<A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>according to the custom of the priest's 
office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <A 
name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The whole multitude of the people were 
praying outside at the hour of incense. 
<P><A name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>An angel of the Lord appeared to him, 
standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <A name=C1V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Zacharias was 
troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <A name=C1V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the angel said 
to him, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and 
your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <A 
name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You will have joy and gladness; and 
many will rejoice at his birth. <A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he will be great in the sight of 
the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the 
Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He will turn many 
of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God. <A name=C1V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He will go before 
him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the 
children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people 
prepared for the Lord." 
<P><A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I 
be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years." 
<P><A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, 
who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you 
this good news. <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, you will be silent and not able 
to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn't 
believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time." 
<P><A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The people were waiting for Zacharias, 
and they marveled that he delayed in the temple. <A name=C1V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he came out, 
he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the 
temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <A 
name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It 
happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. 
<A name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these days Elizabeth, his wife, 
conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <A name=C1V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Thus has the Lord 
done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among 
men." 
<P><A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the sixth month, the angel 
Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <A 
name=C1V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to 
a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of 
David. The virgin's name was Mary. <A name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having come in, the angel said to her, 
"Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among 
women!" 
<P><A name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when she saw him, she was greatly 
troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. <A 
name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel said to her, "Don't be 
afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <A name=C1V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, you will 
conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.' <A 
name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will 
give him the throne of his father, David, <A name=C1V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he will reign 
over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom." 
<P><A name=C1V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary said to the angel, "How can this 
be, seeing I am a virgin?" 
<P><A name=C1V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel answered her, "The Holy 
Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. 
Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. 
<A name=C1V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also 
has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was 
called barren. <A name=C1V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For everything spoken by God is 
possible." 
<P><A name=C1V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the 
Lord; be it to me according to your word." 
<P>The angel departed from her. <A name=C1V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary arose in those days and went into 
the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <A name=C1V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and entered into 
the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <A name=C1V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened, when 
Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth 
was filled with the Holy Spirit. <A name=C1V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She called out with a loud voice, and 
said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <A 
name=C1V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why am I so favored, that the mother of 
my Lord should come to me? <A name=C1V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For behold, when the voice of your 
greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy! <A 
name=C1V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed is she who believed, for there 
will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the 
Lord!" 
<P><A name=C1V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary said, 
<P>&nbsp;"My soul magnifies the Lord.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A 
name=C1V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>My 
spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A 
name=C1V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he has looked at the humble state 
of his handmaid. 
<P>&nbsp;For behold, from now on, all generations will call me 
blessed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=C1V49><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he who is 
mighty has done great things for me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy 
is his name.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=C1V50><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His mercy is for 
generations of generations on those who fear him. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He has shown strength with his 
arm.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has scattered the proud in the 
imagination of their heart. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He has put down princes from their 
thrones.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has exalted the lowly. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He has filled the hungry with good 
things.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has sent the rich away empty. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He has given help to Israel, his 
servant, that he might remember mercy,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A 
name=C1V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
he spoke to our fathers,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Abraham and 
his seed forever." 
<P><A name=C1V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary stayed with her about three 
months, and then returned to her house. <A name=C1V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the time that Elizabeth should give 
birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son. <A name=C1V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Her neighbors and 
her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they 
rejoiced with her. <A name=C1V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened on the eighth day, that 
they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, 
after the name of the father. <A name=C1V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His mother answered, "Not so; but he 
will be called John." 
<P><A name=C1V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said to her, "There is no one 
among your relatives who is called by this name." <A name=C1V62><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They made signs to 
his father, what he would have him called. 
<P><A name=C1V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He asked for a writing tablet, and 
wrote, "His name is John." 
<P>They all marveled. <A name=C1V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His mouth was opened immediately, and 
his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. <A name=C1V65><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Fear came on all 
who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all 
the hill country of Judea. <A name=C1V66><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All who heard them laid them up in 
their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the Lord was 
with him. <A name=C1V67><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His father, Zacharias, was filled with 
the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:68</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of

to Israel. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, 
which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; <A

the day had come that she should give birth. <A name=C2V7><FONT

her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a 
feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. <A

staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. <A

from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, "Let's go to

known to us." <A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough. <A

praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was 
told them. 
<P><A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law, <A

<P><A name=C2V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the things which were spoken concerning him, <A name=C2V34><FONT

them, and said to Mary, his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the falling

<P><A name=C2V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day. <A name=C2V38><FONT

Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover. 
<P><A name=C2V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast, <A name=C2V43><FONT

fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in 
Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn't know it, <A name=C2V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but supposing him 
to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among 
their relatives and acquaintances. <A name=C2V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. <A name=C2V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened after three days they found 
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, 
and asking them questions. <A name=C2V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

understanding and his answers. <A name=C2V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

astonished, and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way? 
Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you." 
<P><A name=C2V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he spoke to them. <A name=C2V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her 
heart. <A name=C2V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

stature, and in favor with God and men. 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being 
tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea

it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, 
<P>&nbsp;"The voice of one crying in the

<P><A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

went out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee 
from the wrath to come? <A name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our

<P><A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that which is appointed to you." 
<P><A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

about us? What must we do?" 
<P>He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone 
wrongfully. Be content with your wages." 
<P><A name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the 
Christ, <A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of 
whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit 
and fire, <A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." 
<P><A name=C3V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

preached good news to the people, <A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

by him for Herodias, his <A

all the evil things which Herod had done, <A name=C3V20><FONT

he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he 
saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, 
you can make me clean."

he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, 
who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of 
the Lord was with him to heal them. <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let 
him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. <A

reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but 
God alone?" 
<P><A name=C5V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

answered them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? 
</FONT><A name=C5V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C5V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. 
<A name=C5V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things 
today." 
<P><A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining 
with them. <A name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax 
collectors and sinners?" <A name=C5V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered them, <FONT

yours eat and drink?" 
<P><A name=C5V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and they could not come near him for the crowd. <A name=C8V20><FONT

<P><A name=C8V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Let's go over to the other side of the lake."</FONT> So 
they launched out. <A name=C8V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<FONT color=#ff0000>"Where is your faith?"</FONT> Being afraid they marveled,

<P><A name=C8V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, 
and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs. <A name=C8V28><FONT

he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I

torment me!" <A name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Jesus was commanding the unclean 
spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. 
He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands 
apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. 
<P><A name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus asked him, <FONT

<P>He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him. <A name=C8V31><FONT

that he would not command them to go into the abyss. <A name=C8V32><FONT

a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would 
allow them to enter into those. He allowed them. <A name=C8V33><FONT

<P><A name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone 
out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were 
afraid. <A name=C8V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

had been possessed by demons was healed. <A name=C8V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him. 
<P><A name=C8V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. <A

and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him 
to come into his house, <A name=C8V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he had an only daughter, about 
twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed 
against him. <A name=C8V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be 
healed by any, <A name=C8V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped. <A name=C8V45><FONT

color=#ff0000>"Who touched me?"</FONT> 
<P>When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the multitudes 
press and jostle you, and you say, <FONT color=#ff0000>'Who touched me?'</FONT>" 

<P><A name=C8V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

me."</FONT> <A name=C8V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

healed immediately. <A name=C8V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

peace."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Don't trouble the Teacher." 
<P><A name=C8V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus hearing it, answered him, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she will be 
healed."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, 
and her mother. <A name=C8V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All were weeping and mourning her, but 
he said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Don't weep. She isn't dead, but sleeping."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were ridiculing him, knowing that 
she was dead. <A name=C8V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he put them all outside, and taking 
her by the hand, he called, saying, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Child, arise!"</FONT> 
<A name=C8V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Her spirit returned, and she rose up 
immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. <A

them to tell no one what had been done. 
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He called <A

gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. <A 
name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <A

said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Take nothing for your journey--neither

<P><A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

villages, preaching the Gospel, and healing everywhere. <A name=C9V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Herod the 
tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because 
it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and by some that 
Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. 
<A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is 
this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him. <A name=C9V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The apostles, when 
they had returned, told him what things they had done. 
<P>He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called 
Bethsaida. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the multitudes, perceiving it, 
followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he 
cured those who needed healing. <A name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The day began to wear away; and the 
twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they may go into 
the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in 
a deserted place." 
<P><A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should 
go and buy food for all these people." <A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>He said to his disciples, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Make them sit down in groups 
of about fifty each."</FONT> <A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

down. <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He took the five loaves and the two 
fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them 
to the disciples to set before the multitude. <A name=C9V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They ate, and were 
all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left 
over. 
<P><A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened, as he was praying alone, 
that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Who do 
the multitudes say that I am?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered, "'John the Baptizer,' 
but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen 
again." 
<P><A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT

<P>Peter answered, "The Christ of God." 
<P><A name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to tell this to no one, <A name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the mountain to pray. <A name=C9V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. <A

who were Moses and Elijah, <A name=C9V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
<P><A name=C9V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and 
the two men who stood with him. <A name=C9V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make 
three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing 
what he said. 
<P><A name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<A name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!" <A name=C9V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they had seen. 
<P><A name=C9V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. <A

cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from 
him, bruising him severely. <A name=C9V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean 
spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. <A name=C9V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were all 
astonished at the majesty of God. 
<P>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to 
his disciples, <A name=C9V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were 
afraid to ask him about this saying. 
<P><A name=C9V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

about which of them was the greatest. <A name=C9V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

all, this one will be great."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C9V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem, <A

size=-1><SUP>9:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and sent messengers before his face. 
They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for 
him. <A name=C9V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C22V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They seized him, and led him away, and 
brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from a distance. <A 
name=C22V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had kindled a fire in the 
middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. <A 
name=C22V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A certain servant girl saw him as he 
sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, "This man also was with 
him." 
<P><A name=C22V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I 
don't know him." 
<P><A name=C22V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, and said, "You also are one of them!" 
<P>But Peter answered, "Man, I am not!" 
<P><A name=C22V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Galilean!" 
<P><A name=C22V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

what you are talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster 
crowed. <A name=C22V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. 
Then Peter remembered the Lord's word, how he said to him, <FONT

<P><A name=C22V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

beat him. <A name=C22V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him on the face and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?" <A

him, insulting him. 
<P><A name=C22V66><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, 
and they led him away into their council, saying, <A name=C22V67><FONT

Christ, tell us." 
<P>But he said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"If I tell you, you won't believe,

<P><A name=C22V70><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C22V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!" 
<P><A name=C23V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The whole company of them rose up and 
brought him before Pilate. <A name=C23V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They began to accuse him, saying, "We 
found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and 
saying that he himself is Christ, a king." 
<P><A name=C23V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of 
the Jews?" 
<P>He answered him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"So you say."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C23V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate said to the chief priests and 
the multitudes, "I find no basis for a charge against this man." 
<P><A name=C23V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up 
the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this 
place." <A name=C23V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Pilate heard Galilee 
mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <A name=C23V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he found out 
that he was in Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in 
Jerusalem during those days. 
<P><A name=C23V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was 
exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had 
heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. <A 
name=C23V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <A name=C23V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests 
and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <A name=C23V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Herod with his 
soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they 
sent him back to Pilate. <A name=C23V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Herod and Pilate became friends with 
each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. 
<P><A name=C23V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate called together the chief 
priests and the rulers and the people, <A name=C23V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said to them, "You brought this 
man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before 
you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of 
which you accuse him. <A name=C23V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to 
him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <A name=C23V16><FONT

chastise him and release him." 
<P><A name=C23V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he had to release one prisoner to 
them at the feast. <A name=C23V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they all cried out together, 
saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!" -- <A name=C23V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>one who was thrown 
into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. 
<P><A name=C23V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Pilate spoke to them again, 
wanting to release Jesus, <A name=C23V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! 
Crucify him!" 
<P><A name=C23V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them the third time, "Why? 
What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will 
therefore chastise him and release him." <A name=C23V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they were 
urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the 
voices of the chief priests prevailed. <A name=C23V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate decreed that what they asked 
for should be done. <A name=C23V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He released him who had been thrown 
into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered 
Jesus up to their will. 
<P><A name=C23V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they led him away, they grabbed 
one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to 
carry it after Jesus. <A name=C23V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A great multitude of the people 
followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. <A 
name=C23V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus, turning to them, said, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for 
yourselves and for your children. </FONT><A name=C23V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT

</FONT><A name=C23V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C23V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

led with him to be put to death. <A name=C23V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they came to the place that is 
called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right 
and the other on the left. 
<P><A name=C23V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

doing."</FONT> 
<P>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. <A name=C23V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The people stood 
watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. 
Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!" 
<P><A name=C23V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The soldiers also mocked him, coming 
to him and offering him vinegar, <A name=C23V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saying, "If you are the King of 
the Jews, save yourself!" 
<P><A name=C23V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS." 
<P><A name=C23V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C23V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him said, "Don't you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? 
<A name=C23V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we indeed justly, for we receive 
the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong." <A

when you come into your Kingdom." 
<P><A name=C23V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Paradise."</FONT>

said this, he breathed his last. 
<P><A name=C23V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they had prepared. <A name=C24V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

these things to the apostles. <A name=C24V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he

another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the
