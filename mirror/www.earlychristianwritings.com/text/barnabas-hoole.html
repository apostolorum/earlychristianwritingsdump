<p>(from: _Apostolic Fathers_, Charles H. Hoole, 1885 translation)</p>

<p> Epistle of BARNABAS</p>

<p>CHAPTER 1<br>
 1:1 |Hail, my sons and daughters, in the name of our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, who hath loved us in peace.<br>
 1:2 |I rejoice exceedingly and beyond measure at your<br>
happy and glorious spirit, since the ordinances of God<br>
are great and rich towards you, who have received the<br>
engrafted grace of the spiritual gift.<br>
 1:3 Wherefore, I congratulate myself the more,<br>
hoping to be saved, because I see of a truth the<br>
Spirit poured out upon you from the rich Lord of love.<br>
So greatly hath your longed-for appearance stricken me<br>
with amazement.<br>
 1:4 Being persuaded, therefore, of this, and knowing<br>
in myself that since I spake among you the Lord hath<br>
helped me in many things in the way of righteousness,<br>
I am altogether compelled to love you even beyond my<br>
own soul, because great faith and love dwelleth in you<br>
in the hope of his life.<br>
 1:5 Considering also this, that if I take care to<br>
communicate to you a part of that which I have<br>
received, it shall turn to my reward to have assisted<br>
such spirits as ye are, I gave diligence to write unto<br>
you in few words, in order that together with your<br>
faith, ye might have your knowledge perfect also.<br>
 1:6 For there are three doctrines ordained of the<br>
Lord: the hope of life, the beginning, and the end.<br>
 1:7 For the Master hath made known unto us by the<br>
prophets the things which are past, and the things<br>
which are at hand, and hath given us the firstfruits<br>
of the knowledge of the things that are to come.<br>
Since, therefore, we see all these things severally<br>
working as he has spoken, we ought the more fully and<br>
loftily to approach to his altar;<br>
 1:8 but I, not as a master, but as one of<br>
yourselves, will show to you a few things, by means of<br>
which ye may even in this present rejoice.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 2<br>
 2:1 |Since, therefore, the days are evil, and the<br>
adversary hath the authority, we ought to take heed to<br>
ourselves and seek out the ordinances of the Lord.<br>
 2:2 For the helpers of our faith are fear and<br>
patience, and they that fight on our side are<br>
long-suffering and continence.<br>
 2:3 While these, therefore, remain pure in things<br>
relating to the Lord, wisdom and understanding,<br>
science and knowledge, rejoice together with them.<br>
 2:4 For God hath made known unto us through all the<br>
prophets, that he desireth neither sacrifices nor<br>
whole burnt offerings, nor oblations; for he saith in<br>
a certain place,<br>
 2:5 To what purpose is the multitude of your<br>
sacrifices? saith the Lord. I am full of the whole<br>
burnt offerings of rams; I desire not the fat of<br>
lambs, nor the blood of bulls and goats, nor need ye<br>
come to be seen of me. For who hath required these<br>
things at your hands? Ye shall not add thereto to<br>
tread my court. If ye bring the fine flour, it is<br>
vain; incense is an abomination unto me; your new<br>
moons and sabbaths I cannot endure; your fastings and<br>
holidays and feasts my soul hateth.<br>
 2:6 These things, therefore, he hath made of none<br>
effect, that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
being free from the yoke of necessity, might have an<br>
offering not made with hands.<br>
 2:7 Again, he saith unto them, Did I command your<br>
fathers, when ye came out of the land of Egypt, offer<br>
unto me whole burnt offerings and sacrifices? --<br>
 2:8 did I not rather command them this? -- Let each<br>
of you bear no malice against his neighbour in his<br>
heart, and love not a false oath.<br>
 2:9 We ought to perceive, since we are not void of<br>
understanding the meaning of the goodness of God our<br>
Father, because he telleth us, wishing to seek us who<br>
are wandering even as sheep, how we ought to approach<br>
him.<br>
 2:10 He therefore speaketh unto us in this wise: The<br>
sacrifice unto God is a broken heart; a smell of sweet<br>
savour unto the Lord is a heart that glorifieth him<br>
that made it. We ought, therefore, brethren, to<br>
examine accurately concerning our salvation, lest the<br>
evil one, making an entrance among us, should draw us<br>
away from our life.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 3<br>
 3:1 |Therefore, he saith again, concerning these<br>
things, unto them, Why fast ye unto me, saith the<br>
Lord, so that your voice is heard to-day in its<br>
crying? This is not the fast that I have chosen, saith<br>
the Lord, for a man to humiliate his soul;<br>
 3:2 nor if ye bend your neck as a ring, and put<br>
under you sackcloth and ashes -- not even then will ye<br>
call it an acceptable fast.<br>
 3:3 But unto us he saith, Behold the fast which I<br>
have chosen, saith the Lord, not that a man should<br>
humiliate his soul, but that he should loose every<br>
bond of unrighteousness, and untie the knots of the<br>
compacts of violence; set at liberty them that are<br>
bruised, and cancel every agreement of<br>
unrighteousness; break thy bread with the hungry, and<br>
if thou seest the naked, clothe him; bring them that<br>
are houseless into thy dwelling, and if thou seest a<br>
man that is lowly, despise him not, and turn not away<br>
from those of thy family;<br>
 3:4 then shall thy light break forth early, and thy<br>
garments shall spring up quickly, and justice shall go<br>
before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall surround<br>
thee;<br>
 3:5 then shalt thou cry, and the Lord shall hearken<br>
unto thee; while thou art yet speaking he shall say,<br>
Lo, I am here: if thou put away from thee the league<br>
and the conspiracy, and the word of murmuring, and<br>
givest thy bread unto the hungry with all thine heart,<br>
and hast compassion upon the soul that is lowly.<br>
 3:6 The long-suffering God therefore having seen<br>
beforehand that the people whom he had prepared for<br>
his beloved would believe in simplicity, showed to us<br>
beforehand concerning all these things, that we should<br>
not come as strangers to their law.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 4<br>
 4:1 |It behoveth, therefore, that we, searching much<br>
concerning the things that are at hand, should seek<br>
out the things that are able to save us. Let us fly,<br>
therefore, utterly from all the work of<br>
unrighteousness, and let us hate the error of the time<br>
that now is, that we may be loved in that which is to<br>
come.<br>
 4:2 Let us not give liberty unto our soul that it<br>
should have leave to run with sinners and evil men,<br>
neither let us be made like unto them.<br>
 4:3 The tribulation being made perfect is at hand,<br>
concerning which it is written, as Enoch saith, For to<br>
this purpose the Lord hath cut short the times and the<br>
days, that his beloved might make haste and come into<br>
his inheritance.<br>
 4:4 The prophet also speaketh in this wise: Ten<br>
kingdoms shall reign upon the earth; and there shall<br>
rise up after them a little king who shall humble<br>
three of the kings under one.<br>
 4:5 And in like manner Daniel speaketh concerning<br>
him: And I saw the fourth beast, evil and strong and<br>
harder than all the beasts of the earth; and I saw how<br>
there grew up from him ten horns, and from among them<br>
a little horn, growing up beside, and how it humbled<br>
under one three of the great horns.<br>
 4:6 Ye ought, therefore, to understand. And moreover<br>
I ask this of you, as being one among you, loving you<br>
especially and altogether, even above my own soul,<br>
that ye should take heed unto yourselves, and not be<br>
like unto certain men, by adding to your sins and<br>
saying that their covenant is also ours. Ours, indeed,<br>
it is; but they have lost it for ever, in this wise,<br>
after that Moses had already received it.<br>
 4:7 For the scripture saith, And Moses was in the<br>
mount fasting forty days and nights, and he received<br>
the covenant from the Lord; even tables of stone<br>
written with the finger of the hand of the Lord. But<br>
when they turned unto idols they lost it.<br>
 4:8 For the Lord saith thus unto Moses, Moses, get<br>
thee down quickly, for thy people, whom thou<br>
broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have done<br>
unlawfully. And Moses understood, and cast the two<br>
tables from his hands, and the covenant that was on<br>
them was broken; to the end that that of the beloved<br>
Jesus might be sealed in our hearts in the hope of his<br>
faith.<br>
 4:9 Now, though I wished to write many things unto<br>
you, not as a master, but even as suiteth one that<br>
loveth you, not to fall short of the things that we<br>
have, I have been zealous to write unto you as though<br>
I were the offscouring of you. Let us, therefore, give<br>
heed unto the last days; for the whole time of our<br>
faith will profit us nothing unless now, in the season<br>
of iniquity and among the stumbling-blocks that are<br>
coming, we resist as becometh the sons of God,<br>
 4:10 that the evil one may not have entrance<br>
unawares. Let us fly all vanity and hate perfectly the<br>
deeds of the evil way. Do not, entering into your own<br>
houses, dwell alone, as though ye were already<br>
justified, but coming together, inquire one with<br>
another concerning the common advantage.<br>
 4:11 For the scripture saith, Woe unto them that are<br>
wise in their own conceit and learned in their own<br>
eyes. Let us be spiritual: let us be a perfect temple<br>
unto God. So far as in you lieth, let us practise the<br>
fear of God, and strive to keep his commandments, that<br>
we may be glad in his ordinances.<br>
 4:12 The Lord shall judge the world without respect<br>
of persons; each shall receive according as he hath<br>
done; if he be good, righteousness shall go before<br>
him, but if he be evil, the reward of wickedness shall<br>
be before him.<br>
 4:13 Let us give heed that we do not, as being<br>
already elect, take rest, and sleep in our sins, lest<br>
the ruler of wickedness, getting the mastery over us,<br>
thrust us from the kingdom of the Lord.<br>
 4:14 And, moreover, my brethren, consider this. When<br>
ye see that after so many signs and wonders that have<br>
happened in Israel, even then they have been<br>
abandoned, let us take heed lest, as it is written,<br>
many of us be called but few chosen.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 5<br>
 5:1 |For on this account the Lord endured to give his<br>
flesh unto corruption, that we might be sanctified by<br>
the remission of sins, which is by the sprinkling of<br>
his blood.<br>
 5:2 For there are written concerning him certain<br>
things that pertain unto Israel, and certain other<br>
that pertain unto us. For he speaketh thus, He was<br>
wounded for our iniquities, and vexed for our sins; by<br>
his stripes we are healed. He was led as a sheep unto<br>
the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before him that<br>
sheareth it.<br>
 5:3 We ought, therefore, to give especial thanks<br>
unto the Lord because he hath made known unto us the<br>
things that are past, and hath made us wise with<br>
regard to those that are at hand, neither are we<br>
without understanding as regards the future.<br>
 5:4 For the scripture saith, Not unjustly is the net<br>
stretched for the birds. Now this meaneth that a man<br>
will perish justly who, having a knowledge of the path<br>
of righteousness, shutteth himself up into the way of<br>
darkness.<br>
 5:5 Consider this too, my brethren; if the Lord<br>
endured to suffer for our souls, though he were the<br>
Lord of the whole world, to whom God said from the<br>
foundation of the world, Let us make man according to<br>
our image and according to our likeness, how then did<br>
he endure to suffer at the hands of men? Learn ye!<br>
 5:6 The prophets having received the grace from him<br>
prophesied with regard to him. But he, that he might<br>
make death of none effect and bring to light the<br>
resurrection from the dead, because it behoved him to<br>
be made manifest in the flesh,<br>
 5:7 endured it, that he might give unto our fathers<br>
the promise, and by preparing for himself a new<br>
people, might show, while upon earth, that he will<br>
raise the dead and himself execute judgment.<br>
 5:8 Yea, further; though he taught Israel and did so<br>
many signs and wonders among them, yet they loved him<br>
not.<br>
 5:9 But when he chose out his own Apostles, who were<br>
about to preach his gospel, they were men unrighteous<br>
beyond all sin, that he might show that he came not to<br>
call the righteous but sinners to repentance; then<br>
made he himself manifest that he was the Son of God.<br>
 5:10 For if he had not come in the flesh how could<br>
men have looked upon him and have been saved, since<br>
they cannot endure to look at the rays of the sun<br>
which must one day perish, and which is the work of<br>
his hands?<br>
 5:11 For this purpose did the Son of God come in the<br>
flesh, that he might sum up and finish the sin of them<br>
who persecuted his prophets unto death;<br>
 5:12 therefore he endured even unto this. For God<br>
saith that the smiting of his flesh it was from them.<br>
When they shall smite their shepherd, then shall the<br>
sheep of the flock be scattered.<br>
 5:13 But he himself wished thus to suffer, for it<br>
was necessary that he should suffer upon the cross;<br>
for he who prophesieth about him saith, Spare my soul<br>
from the sword, and again, Drive nails into my flesh,<br>
for the synagogues of evil men have risen against me.<br>
 5:14 And again he saith, Behold, I have given my<br>
back unto the scourging and my cheeks unto buffetings;<br>
my face also have I set as a hard rock.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 6<br>
 6:1 |When, therefore, he made the commandment what<br>
sayeth he? Who is he that disputeth with me? let him<br>
resist me; or who is he that contendeth with me? let<br>
him draw nigh unto the Son of the Lord.<br>
 6:2 Woe unto you, for you shall all wax old as a<br>
garment, and the moth shall devour you. And again the<br>
prophet saith, Since he hath been placed, as a strong<br>
stone, for crushing; behold I will place on the<br>
foundation of Zion a stone precious, elect, a chief<br>
corner stone of great price.<br>
 6:3 And then what saith he? And he that believeth in<br>
him shall live for ever. Is then our hope in a stone?<br>
God forbid. But it is thus said because the Lord hath<br>
made strong his flesh, for he saith, And he made me as<br>
it were a hard rock.<br>
 6:4 And again, The stone which the builders rejected<br>
hath become the head of the corner. And again he<br>
saith, This is the day, great and wonderful, which the<br>
Lord hath made.<br>
 6:5 I write unto you the more simply that ye may<br>
understand. I am the offscouring of your love.<br>
 6:6 What then saith the prophet again? The synagogue<br>
of the wicked came around me; they surrounded me as<br>
bees do an honey-comb, and, over my garment they cast<br>
lots.<br>
 6:7 Since, therefore, he was about to be made<br>
manifest and to suffer in the flesh, his suffering was<br>
showed beforehand. For the prophet saith unto Israel,<br>
Woe unto their soul, for they have counselled an evil<br>
counsel among themselves, saying, Let us bind the<br>
righteous because he is an encumbrance unto us.<br>
 6:8 And what saith the other prophet, even Moses,<br>
unto them? Behold, thus saith the Lord God: Enter into<br>
the good land which the Lord sware unto Abraham and<br>
Isaac and Jacob, and inherit it, even a land flowing<br>
with milk and honey.<br>
 6:9 What saith the knowledge? Learn ye. Hope, it<br>
saith, upon Jesus, who is about to be manifested unto<br>
you in the flesh. For man is but earth which suffers;<br>
for, from the face of the ground was made the moulding<br>
of Adam.<br>
 6:10 What then meaneth he when he saith, Into the<br>
good land which floweth with milk and honey? Blessed<br>
be the Lord, brethren, who hath put into you wisdom<br>
and knowledge of his secret things. For the prophet<br>
speaketh a parable from the Lord. Who shall<br>
understand, except he that is wise and skilful and<br>
that loveth his Lord?<br>
 6:11 Since, therefore, having renewed us by the<br>
remission of our sins, he hath made us of a new<br>
character, he willeth that we should have the souls of<br>
children, inasmuch as it is indeed he who hath formed<br>
us anew.<br>
 6:12 For the scripture saith concerning us, that he<br>
saith unto the Son, Let us make man after our own<br>
image and according to our likeness; and let them rule<br>
over the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of heaven,<br>
and the fishes of the sea. And the Lord said, when he<br>
saw how excellent our form was, Increase and multiply<br>
and replenish the earth. These things he saith unto<br>
the Son.<br>
 6:13 Again I will show unto thee how the Lord<br>
speaketh unto us, since he hath made a second<br>
fashioning in these last days; the Lord saith, Behold<br>
I make the last even as the first. For to this purpose<br>
did the prophet preach. Enter ye into the land flowing<br>
with milk and honey, and have dominion over it.<br>
 6:14 Behold now we have been formed again, even as<br>
he saith again in another prophet: Behold, saith the<br>
Lord, I will take out from these, that is out of those<br>
whom the Spirit of the Lord foresaw, the hearts of<br>
stone, and will put into them hearts of flesh, because<br>
he himself was about to be manifested in the flesh and<br>
to dwell among us.<br>
 6:15 For the habitation of our heart is a temple<br>
holy unto the Lord.<br>
 6:16 For the Lord saith again, Whereby shall I<br>
appear before the Lord my God and be glorified? He<br>
saith too, I will give thanks unto thee in the<br>
assembly, in the midst of my brethren; I will sing<br>
unto thee in the midst of the assembly of the saints.<br>
We are, therefore, those whom he brought into the good<br>
land.<br>
 6:17 What, then, meaneth the milk and honey? It is<br>
because a child is kept alive, first with honey,<br>
afterwards with milk. So we, too, being quickened by<br>
faith in his promise and by his word, shall live and<br>
rule over the earth.<br>
 6:18 And we said previously, And let them increase<br>
and multiply and rule over the fish. Who then is he<br>
who is able to rule over the beasts, the fish, and<br>
fowls of heaven? For we ought to perceive that to rule<br>
belongeth to authority, so that a man by giving<br>
commands may exercise lordship.<br>
 6:19 If, therefore, this doth not take place now, he<br>
hath told us when it will; even when we ourselves have<br>
been made perfect, so that we become heirs of the<br>
covenant of the Lord.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 7<br>
 7:1 |Ye perceive, therefore, beloved children, that<br>
our good Lord hath manifested unto us all things<br>
beforehand, to the end that we should know whom we<br>
ought to praise, returning thanks for all things.<br>
 7:2 If, therefore, the Son of God, being he who is<br>
the Lord and who is about to judge the quick and the<br>
dead, suffered, to the end that his stripes might make<br>
us live, let us believe that the Son of God could not<br>
suffer except on our account.<br>
 7:3 But being crucified, he was given to drink of<br>
vinegar and gall. How, then, did the priests of the<br>
temple signify concerning this? Now, the commandment<br>
is written in this wise: Whosoever shall not fast on<br>
the fast, he shall die the death, the Lord hath<br>
commanded it. Since he also was about to offer the<br>
vessel that contained his spirit as a sacrifice, in<br>
order that the type might be fulfilled which was given<br>
by the offering of Isaac at the altar,<br>
 7:4 what saith he in the book of the prophet? And<br>
let them eat of the goat which is offered on the fast<br>
for the sins of all. Attend ye diligently thereto. And<br>
let the priests alone eat of the unwashed entrails<br>
with vinegar.<br>
 7:5 With what signification? Because ye will one day<br>
give me to drink of vinegar and gall, when I am about<br>
to offer up my flesh for my new people, eat ye it<br>
alone, while the people fast and lament in sackcloth<br>
and ashes. He commanded this in order that he might<br>
show that he must needs suffer at their hands.<br>
 7:6 How, then, did he give his commands? Attend ye.<br>
Take ye two goats, fair and like each other, and offer<br>
them up. And let the priest take one of them as a<br>
whole burnt offering for sin.<br>
 7:7 But what shall they do with the other? Let the<br>
other, he saith, be accursed. Now attend ye, how the<br>
type of Jesus is made manifest.<br>
 7:8 And do ye all spit upon it and pierce it, and<br>
put scarlet wool around its head, and so let it be<br>
cast out into the wilderness. And when this hath been<br>
done, he who beareth the goat leadeth it out into the<br>
wilderness, and taketh away the wool and placeth it<br>
upon a bush, which is called rachel, the shoots of<br>
which we are accustomed to eat when we find them in<br>
the fields. Thus the fruit of the rachel only is<br>
sweet.<br>
 7:9 What, therefore, meaneth this? Attend ye. One is<br>
brought to the altar, the other is accursed, and the<br>
accursed one is crowned, because they shall see him in<br>
that day, who had the scarlet robe about his flesh,<br>
and they shall say, Is not this he whom once we set at<br>
naught and crucified, and spat upon and pierced? Truly<br>
this was he who at that time said that he was the Son<br>
of God.<br>
 7:10 How then was the one like to the other? In this<br>
respect were the goats like him: they were fair and<br>
equal, so that when they saw him coming they were<br>
astonished at the likeness to the goat. Therefore,<br>
behold here the type of Jesus, who was about to<br>
suffer.<br>
 7:11 And what meaneth the wool placed in the midst<br>
of thorns? It is a type of Jesus, which hath been<br>
placed in the church. For he who wisheth to take the<br>
scarlet wool must suffer many things, because the<br>
thorn is terrible, and must after tribulation gain<br>
possession of it. So he saith, They who wish to see me<br>
and to take hold of my kingdom must through trouble<br>
and suffering receive me.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 8<br>
 8:1 |And what type, think ye, was the commandment<br>
unto Israel, that the men in whom sin had been<br>
accomplished should offer a heifer, and after they had<br>
slaughtered it should burn it, and that children<br>
should then take the ashes and cast them into vessels,<br>
and place scarlet wool and hyssop around a stick --<br>
behold, again, the type of the cross and the scarlet<br>
wool, -- and so the children should sprinkle the<br>
people one by one, that they might be purged from<br>
their sins?<br>
 8:2 Behold, therefore, in what way he speaketh unto<br>
you with simplicity. The heifer signifieth Jesus; the<br>
sinful men who offer it are the men who brought him<br>
unto the slaughter. But now the men are no longer<br>
before us, no longer doth the glory belong to sinners.<br>
 8:3 The children who sprinkled are they who brought<br>
us the good news of the forgiveness of sins and<br>
purification of heart, to whom he hath given the<br>
authority of the gospel for the purpose of preaching,<br>
being twelve in number, for a testimony unto the<br>
tribes, for twelve were the tribes of Israel.<br>
 8:4 And why, then, were the children who sprinkled<br>
three in number? For a testimony unto Abraham, Isaac,<br>
and Jacob, because these are great before God.<br>
 8:5 And what signifieth the wool upon the stick?<br>
Because the kingdom of Jesus is upon the cross, and<br>
because they who hope upon him shall live for ever.<br>
 8:6 And why are there at the same time the wool and<br>
the hyssop? Because in his kingdom the days in which<br>
we shall be saved shall be evil and filthy, because<br>
also he that grieveth his flesh is healed through the<br>
purifying of the hyssop.<br>
 8:7 And these things having happened on this account<br>
are manifest unto us, but obscure unto them, because<br>
they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 9<br>
 9:1 |He saith also again concerning our ears how he<br>
hath circumcised our heart. The Lord saith in the<br>
prophet, They have hearkened unto me with the hearing<br>
of their ears; and again, he saith, They that are afar<br>
off shall hear with their ears; they shall know what I<br>
have done; and be ye circumcised, saith the Lord, in<br>
your heart;<br>
 9:2 and again, Hear, O Israel, for thus saith the<br>
Lord thy God; and again the Spirit of the Lord<br>
prophesied, Who is he that wisheth to live for ever?<br>
let him hearken unto the voice of my Son.<br>
 9:3 And again he saith, Hear, O heaven, and give<br>
ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken these things<br>
for a testimony. And again he saith, Hearken unto the<br>
voice of the Lord, ye rulers of this people. And again<br>
he saith, Hearken ye children unto the voice of one<br>
crying in the wilderness.<br>
 9:4 To this end, therefore, hath he circumcised our<br>
hearing, that when we hear his word, we should<br>
believe; for the circumcision in which they trust is<br>
done away with. For he hath said that circumcision is<br>
not that which was made in the flesh; but they have<br>
transgressed, for an evil angel hath deluded them.<br>
 9:5 He saith unto them, These things saith the Lord<br>
your God, -- here I find a new commandment -- Sow not<br>
among thorns, but be ye circumcised unto your Lord.<br>
And what saith he? Circumcise the hardness of your<br>
hearts, and harden not your neck. And again, Behold,<br>
saith the Lord, all the Gentiles are uncircumcised in<br>
their foreskin, but this people is uncircumcised in<br>
their hearts.<br>
 9:6 But he will say, Of a truth the people have been<br>
circumcised for a seal unto them; but so, also, hath<br>
every Syrian and Arabian, and all the priests of<br>
idols. Do they also belong to the covenant? But the<br>
Egyptians also are in circumcision.<br>
 9:7 Learn, therefore, children of love, richly<br>
concerning all things, that Abraham, who first gave<br>
circumcision, circumcised, looking forward in the<br>
spirit unto Jesus, having received the doctrines of<br>
the three letters.<br>
 9:8 For he saith, And Abraham circumcised out of his<br>
household eighteen and three hundred. What, then, was<br>
the knowledge that was given by this? Learn ye, that<br>
he mentioneth the eighteen first, and then, having<br>
made an interval, he mentioneth the three hundred. In<br>
the eighteen, IH, you have Jesus; and because the<br>
cross in the letter T was about to convey the grace of<br>
redemption, he mentioneth also the three hundred.<br>
Therefore, he showeth Jesus in the two letters, IH,<br>
and the cross in the one, T.<br>
 9:9 He knoweth this who hath placed the engrafted<br>
gift of his teaching in us. No one hath had from me a<br>
more true account than this; but I know that ye are<br>
worthy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 10<br>
 10:1 |But in that Moses said, Thou shalt not eat the<br>
swine, nor the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the crow, nor<br>
any fish that hath not scales in itself, he had in his<br>
mind three doctrines.<br>
 10:2 For in the end he saith unto them in<br>
Deuteronomy, And I will arrange before this people my<br>
ordinances. The commandment of God is not, therefore,<br>
that they should not eat; but Moses spake in a<br>
spiritual sense.<br>
 10:3 He spake of the swine with this meaning: Thou<br>
shalt not cleave, he meaneth, unto men of this sort,<br>
who are like unto swine, for when they become wanton<br>
they forget their Lord, but when they are in want they<br>
think upon the Lord; even as the swine when it eateth<br>
knoweth not its lord, but when it is hungry it crieth,<br>
and when it hath received it is again silent.<br>
 10:4 Nor shalt thou eat of the eagle, nor of the<br>
hawk, nor of the kite, nor of the crow. Thou shalt<br>
not, he meaneth, cleave to, nor be like to men of this<br>
sort, who know not how to provide sustenance for<br>
themselves by labour and sweat, but in their iniquity<br>
seize the property of others, and, as though they<br>
walked in innocence, watch and observe whom they shall<br>
plunder, through their covetousness; even as these<br>
birds alone provide not sustenance for themselves by<br>
means of toil, but, sitting idle, seek out how they<br>
may eat the flesh of others, being destructive by<br>
reason of their wickedness.<br>
 10:5 And thou shalt not eat, he saith, of the<br>
lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttle-fish. Thou shalt<br>
not, he meaneth, cleave to or become like unto men of<br>
this sort, who are impious unto the end, and have been<br>
already condemned to death, even as these accursed<br>
fish alone swim in the depth, not floating as the<br>
others do, but dwelling in the earth below the depth<br>
of the sea.<br>
 10:6 Thus, he saith, Thou shalt not eat the hare,<br>
meaning thou shalt not indulge in unnatural lusts;<br>
 10:7 nor shalt thou eat the hyaena, meaning thou<br>
shalt not be an adulterer;<br>
 10:8 nor shalt thou eat the weazel, meaning thou<br>
shalt not do uncleanness with thy mouth concerning<br>
food;<br>
 10:9 therefore Moses spake in the spirit these three<br>
doctrines. But they, according to the lusts of their<br>
flesh, received them as being about meat.<br>
 10:10 And David receiveth knowledge concerning the<br>
same three doctrines, and saith in like manner,<br>
Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel<br>
of the ungodly, even as the fish walk in darkness into<br>
the depths of the sea, and hath not stood in the way<br>
of sinners, even as they who pretend to fear the Lord<br>
sin as doth the swine, and hath not sat in the seat of<br>
the destroyers, even as the birds that sit for prey.<br>
Ye have also in the end a commandment concerning food;<br>
 10:11 but Moses said, Eat ye everything that is<br>
cloven-footed and that cheweth the cud. What meaneth<br>
he? He that taketh food knoweth him that feedeth him,<br>
and, resting upon him, seemeth to be glad. He<br>
therefore saith well, having regard to the<br>
commandment. What then meaneth he? Cleave ye unto them<br>
that fear the Lord, who walk in his commandments,<br>
which they have received in their hearts; unto them<br>
that speak of the ordinances of the Lord, and observe<br>
them, unto them who know that the practice of them is<br>
a work of gladness, and who meditate on the word of<br>
the Lord. But what meaneth that which cleaveth the<br>
hoof? It meaneth that the just walketh even in this<br>
world, and expecteth the holy life. Behold how well<br>
Moses hath made these laws;<br>
 10:12 but how was it possible for them to perceive<br>
or understand these things? But we, having rightly<br>
understood the commandments, speak them even as the<br>
Lord hath willed. On this account hath he circumcised<br>
our ears and hearts, that we should understand these<br>
things.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 11<br>
 11:1 |Let us inquire, therefore, if the Lord cared to<br>
show us beforehand concerning the water and concerning<br>
the cross. Concerning the water it is written, with<br>
respect to Israel, how that they will not receive the<br>
baptism that bringeth remission of sins, but will<br>
establish one for themselves.<br>
 11:2 The prophet therefore speaketh in this wise, Be<br>
astonished, O heaven! and let the earth be afraid<br>
still more at this, because this people hath done two<br>
great and evil things: they have abandoned me who am<br>
the fountain of life, and have dug for themselves<br>
broken cisterns.<br>
 11:3 Is my holy mountain of Zion a deserted rock? ye<br>
shall be as the young of a bird which have flown when<br>
the nest has been taken away.<br>
 11:4 And again the prophet saith, I will go before<br>
thee and will lay low the mountains. And I will break<br>
the doors of brass and burst the bars of iron; and I<br>
will give unto thee the treasures of darkness hidden<br>
and unseen, that they may know that I am the Lord God;<br>
and, He shall dwell in the lofty cave of the strong<br>
rock.<br>
 11:5 Then what saith he of the Son? His water is<br>
faithful. Ye shall behold the king in his glory, and<br>
your soul shall practise the fear of the Lord.<br>
 11:6 And again, in another prophet, he saith, He<br>
that doeth these things shall be as a tree that<br>
groweth beside the watercourses, which giveth his<br>
fruit in his season; and his leaf shall not fall off,<br>
and whatever he doeth shall prosper.<br>
 11:7 Not so are the ungodly, not so; they are like<br>
the dust which the wind carrieth away from the face of<br>
the earth, wherefore the ungodly shall not rise up in<br>
judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the just:<br>
for the Lord knoweth the way of the just, but the way<br>
of the ungodly shall perish.<br>
 11:8 Ye perceive how he hath put together the water<br>
and the cross. For what he meaneth is this, Blessed<br>
are they who having hoped on the cross have gone down<br>
into the water. For he speaketh of a reward to be<br>
given at the due season; then, saith he, I will render<br>
what is due unto you. But now in that he saith, Their<br>
leaves shall not fall off, he meaneth this, That every<br>
word that goeth out from your mouth in faith and love<br>
shall be for a refuge and a hope unto many.<br>
 11:9 And again another prophet saith, And the land<br>
of Jacob was praised beyond the whole earth. By so<br>
saying he meaneth this, He shall glorify the vessel<br>
that containeth his Spirit.<br>
 11:10 And what sayeth he afterwards? There was a<br>
river flowing on the right, and there grew up on its<br>
banks fair trees, and whosoever eateth of them shall<br>
live for ever.<br>
 11:11 By this he meaneth that we go down into the<br>
water full of sin and pollution, and go up bearing<br>
fruit in the heart, having in the spirit fear and hope<br>
toward Jesus. And whoever shall eat of them shall live<br>
for ever. He meaneth this, Whoever, he saith, shall<br>
hear these words spoken and believe them shall live<br>
for ever.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 12<br>
 12:1 |In like manner again he signifieth concerning<br>
the cross in another prophet, who saith, And when<br>
shall these things be fulfilled? The Lord saith, When<br>
the tree hath been bent and shall rise up again, and<br>
when blood shall flow from the tree. You have again a<br>
prophecy concerning the cross and about him who is<br>
about to be crucified.<br>
 12:2 And he saith again in Moses, when Israel was<br>
being made war upon by aliens, even that he might<br>
remind them while they were being made war upon, that<br>
for their sins they were being delivered over unto<br>
death, the Spirit saith unto the heart of Moses, that<br>
he should make the form of a cross, and of him who was<br>
about to suffer, for if, he says, they shall not hope<br>
upon him, they will be made war upon for ever. Moses,<br>
therefore, arranges weapon against weapon in the midst<br>
of the battle, and standing higher than all, stretched<br>
out his hands, and so again Israel conquered; then,<br>
when he let them down, they were again slaughtered.<br>
 12:3 Wherefore? that they might know that they are<br>
not to be saved except they hope upon him.<br>
 12:4 And again, in another prophet, he saith, All<br>
day long have I stretched out my hands unto a people<br>
who are disobedient, and who speak against my<br>
righteous way.<br>
 12:5 Again, Moses maketh another type of Jesus, that<br>
it behoveth that he should suffer, and cause others to<br>
live, whom they thought that they had destroyed in<br>
figure when Israel was falling: For the Lord made<br>
every kind of serpent to bite them, and they died,<br>
since the transgression happened to Eve by means of<br>
the serpent, to the end that he might convince them<br>
that through their transgression they should be given<br>
over to the pangs of death.<br>
 12:6 For in the end Moses himself, after that he had<br>
given commandment, There shall not be among you a<br>
molten image or a graven image for a god, maketh one<br>
himself, that he might show a type of Jesus. Moses,<br>
therefore, maketh a brazen serpent, and setteth it<br>
aloft, and calleth the people by a proclamation.<br>
 12:7 When, therefore, they had come together they<br>
besought Moses, that he should offer supplication for<br>
them concerning their healing. Moses therefore said<br>
unto them, When any of you is bitten let him come unto<br>
the dead serpent, that is placed upon the tree, and<br>
let him believe and hope that, though it is dead, it<br>
is able to make him live, and immediately he shall be<br>
saved; and so did they. You have, therefore, again in<br>
these things also, the glory of Jesus, that in him and<br>
to him are all things.<br>
 12:8 What again saith Moses unto Jesus the son of<br>
Nun, after he had given this name to him, being a<br>
prophet, to this end alone, that all the people might<br>
hear that the Father revealeth all things concerning<br>
the Son, Jesus?<br>
 12:9 Moses therefore saith unto Jesus the son of<br>
Nun, having given him this name, when he sent him to<br>
spy out the land, Take the book into thy hands and<br>
write what the Lord saith, even that the Son of God,<br>
in the last days, will cut off the whole house of<br>
Amalek from the roots.<br>
 12:10 Behold, therefore, again Jesus, not the son of<br>
man but the Son of God, and by a type made manifest in<br>
the flesh. Since, therefore, they should one day say<br>
that Christ is the son of David, David himself<br>
prophesieth, being in fear and understanding the<br>
deceitfulness of sinners, The Lord said unto my Lord,<br>
Sit on my right hand until I make thy enemies thy<br>
footstool.<br>
 12:11 And again Esaias speaketh in this wise, The<br>
Lord said unto Christ, my Lord, whose right hand I<br>
have held, that the Gentiles should hearken before<br>
him, and I will break the strength of kings. Behold<br>
how David calleth him Lord, and doth not call him son.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 13<br>
 13:1 |Let us inquire, therefore, whether this people<br>
or the first people inheriteth, and whether the<br>
covenant is unto us or unto them.<br>
 13:2 Hear, now, what the scripture saith concerning<br>
the people. But Isaac prayed for Rebecca his wife<br>
because she was barren, and she conceived. Then went<br>
forth Rebecca to inquire of the Lord, and the Lord<br>
said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two<br>
peoples are in thy bowels, and the one people shall<br>
surpass the other, and the elder shall serve the<br>
younger.<br>
 13:3 We ought to understand who was Isaac and who<br>
was Rebecca, and concerning whom he declared that the<br>
one people was greater than the other.<br>
 13:4 And in another prophecy Jacob speaketh yet more<br>
clearly to Joseph his son, saying, Behold the Lord<br>
hath not deprived me of thy face; bring unto me thy<br>
sons, that I may bless them.<br>
 13:5 And he brought unto him Ephraim and Manasseh,<br>
wishing that he should bless Manasseh, because he was<br>
the elder. Joseph, therefore, brought him to the right<br>
hand of his father Jacob. But Jacob saw in spirit a<br>
figure of the people that should be hereafter. And<br>
what saith the Scriptures? And Jacob crossed his<br>
hands, and placed his right hand on the head of<br>
Ephraim, the second and youngest, and blessed him. And<br>
Joseph said unto Jacob, Change thy right hand unto the<br>
head of Manasseh, because he is my firstborn son. And<br>
Jacob said unto Joseph, I know, my child, I know; but<br>
the elder shall serve the younger; but this one also<br>
shall be blessed.<br>
 13:6 Behold in what way he appointed that this<br>
people should be the first and heir of the covenant.<br>
 13:7 If, therefore, it were moreover mentioned<br>
through Abraham also, we have the perfecting of our<br>
knowledge. What, therefore, saith he unto Abraham,<br>
when he alone believed, and it was counted unto him<br>
for righteousness? Behold I have made thee, Abraham, a<br>
father of the nations who in uncircumcision believe in<br>
the Lord.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 14<br>
 14:1 |Yea; but let us inquire whether he hath given<br>
the covenant that he swear unto the fathers that he<br>
would give unto the people. Verily he hath given it;<br>
but they were not worthy to receive it on account of<br>
their sins.<br>
 14:2 For the prophet saith, And Moses was fasting in<br>
Mount Sinai forty days and forty nights, that he might<br>
receive the covenant which the Lord hath made with his<br>
people. And he received from the Lord the two tables<br>
that were written in the spirit with the finger of the<br>
hand of the Lord. And Moses, when he had received<br>
them, was bringing them down to the people for to give<br>
them.<br>
 14:3 And the Lord said unto Moses, Moses, Moses, get<br>
thee down quickly, for thy people, whom thou<br>
broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have done<br>
unlawfully. And Moses perceived that they had again<br>
made molten images, and he cast the tables from his<br>
hands, and the tables of the covenant of the Lord were<br>
broken.<br>
 14:4 Moses indeed received them, but the people were<br>
not worthy. Hearken ye, therefore, how we have<br>
received them. Moses received them being a servant,<br>
but the Lord himself gave unto us to be a people of<br>
inheritance, having suffered for our sake.<br>
 14:5 And he was made manifest, that both they might<br>
be made perfect in their sins, and that we, through<br>
him that inherited, might receive the covenant of the<br>
Lord Jesus, who, for this purpose was prepared, that<br>
by appearing himself and redeeming from darkness our<br>
hearts, which were already lavished on death, and<br>
given over to the iniquity of deceit, he might place<br>
in us the covenant of his people.<br>
 14:6 For it is written how the Father giveth<br>
commandment unto him, that having redeemed us from<br>
darkness, he should prepare for himself a holy people.<br>
 14:7 Therefore the prophet saith, I, the Lord thy<br>
God, have called thee in righteousness, and I will<br>
hold thy hand and make thee strong; and I have given<br>
thee for a covenant to the nation, for a light unto<br>
the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, and to<br>
bring out of chains them that are bound, and from the<br>
house of prison them that sit in darkness. We know<br>
from whence we were redeemed.<br>
 14:8 And again, the prophet saith, Behold, I have<br>
placed thee for a light unto the Gentiles, that thou<br>
shouldst be for a salvation even unto the end of the<br>
earth; thus saith the Lord God who hath redeemed thee.<br>
 14:9 And again, the prophet saith, The Spirit of the<br>
Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach<br>
the gospel unto the poor, he hath sent me to heal<br>
those that are broken in heart, to preach deliverance<br>
to the captives, and the recovery of sight to the<br>
blind, to tell of the acceptable year of the Lord, and<br>
the day of recompense, to comfort all that mourn.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 15<br>
 15:1 |And, moreover, concerning the sabbath it is<br>
written in the ten commandments, in which he spake on<br>
Mount Sinai unto Moses face to face: Sanctify ye the<br>
sabbath of the Lord with pure hands and a pure heart.<br>
 15:2 And in another place he saith, If my sons shall<br>
keep my sabbath, then will I place my mercy upon them.<br>
 15:3 He speaketh, too, of the sabbath in the<br>
beginning of the creation: And God made in six days<br>
the works of his hands, and finished them on the<br>
seventh day, and rested in it and sanctified it.<br>
 15:4 Consider, my children, what signify the words,<br>
He finished them in six days. They mean this: that in<br>
six thousand years the Lord will make an end of all<br>
things, for a day is with him as a thousand years. And<br>
he himself beareth witness unto me, saying: Behold<br>
this day a day shall be as a thousand years.<br>
Therefore, my children, in six days, that is in six<br>
thousand years, shall all things be brought to an end.<br>
 15:5 And the words, He rested on the seventh day,<br>
signify this: After that his Son hath come, and hath<br>
caused to cease the time of the wicked one, and hath<br>
judged the ungodly, and changed the sun and the moon<br>
and the stars, then shall he rest well on the seventh<br>
day.<br>
 15:6 And further he saith, Thou shalt sanctify it<br>
with pure hands and a pure heart. Who, therefore, can<br>
sanctify the day which the Lord hath sanctified,<br>
unless he be pure of heart? in all things have we been<br>
deceived.<br>
 15:7 Behold, that then indeed we shall be able to<br>
rest well and sanctify; even when we ourselves, having<br>
been justified, and having received the promise, when<br>
iniquity exists no longer, but all things have been<br>
made new by the Lord, we shall then be able to<br>
sanctify it, having been first sanctified ourselves.<br>
 15:8 And, further, he saith unto them, Your new<br>
moons and your sabbaths I cannot endure. See, now,<br>
what he meaneth. The sabbaths, that now are, are not<br>
acceptable unto me, but that which I have made is,<br>
even that in which, after that I have brought all<br>
things to an end, I shall make a beginning of the<br>
eighth day, which thing is the beginning of another<br>
world.<br>
 15:9 Wherefore we keep the eighth day as a day of<br>
gladness, on which also Jesus rose from the dead, and<br>
after he had appeared ascended unto heaven.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 16<br>
 16:1 |And I will, moreover, tell you concerning the<br>
temple, how these wretched men, being deceived, placed<br>
their hopes in the building as if it were the<br>
habitation of God, and not on the God who hath made<br>
them.<br>
 16:2 For almost after the manner of the Gentiles did<br>
they consecrate him in the temple. But what saith the<br>
Lord, making it of none effect? Hearken ye: Who hath<br>
measured out the heaven with his palm, or the earth<br>
with the flat of his hand, is it not I? saith the<br>
Lord. Heaven is my throne, and earth the footstool of<br>
my feet. What house will ye build for me, or what<br>
shall be the place of my rest? Ye have known that<br>
their hope was vain.<br>
 16:3 And, yet further, he saith again, Behold they<br>
that have destroyed this temple shall rebuild it.<br>
 16:4 And so doth it happen, for through their war it<br>
has been destroyed by the enemy, and now both they<br>
themselves and the servants of their enemies shall<br>
rebuild it.<br>
 16:5 And again it was made manifest how the temple<br>
and the people of Israel should be given up to their<br>
enemies. For the scripture saith, And it shall come to<br>
pass in the last days that the Lord shall deliver up<br>
the sheep of his pasture, and their fold and their<br>
tower shall he give up to destruction; and it happened<br>
according to that which the Lord had spoken.<br>
 16:6 Let us inquire, therefore, whether there be any<br>
temple of God. There is; even where he himself hath<br>
declared that he would make and perfect it. For it is<br>
written, And it shall be when the week is completed<br>
that the temple of God shall be built gloriously in<br>
the name of the Lord.<br>
 16:7 I find, therefore, that there is a temple; how<br>
then shall it be built in the name of the Lord? Learn<br>
ye. Before that we believed in God the habitation of<br>
our heart was corrupt and feeble, as being of a truth<br>
a temple built by hands. For it was full of idolatry,<br>
and was a habitation of devils, because we did such<br>
things as were contrary to God;<br>
 16:8 but it shall be built in the name of the Lord.<br>
Attend ye: that the temple of the Lord may be built<br>
gloriously. But in what manner? Learn ye: having<br>
received the remission of our sins, and having hoped<br>
upon the name of the Lord, we have become new, having<br>
been again created entirely. Wherefore God of a truth<br>
dwelleth in us as in an habitation.<br>
 16:9 How? The word of his faith, the calling of his<br>
promise, the wisdom of his ordinances, the<br>
commandments of his doctrine, he himself prophesying<br>
in us, he himself dwelling in us. To us, who were<br>
enslaved by death, he openeth the gate of the temple,<br>
which is his mouth, and, giving us repentance, leadeth<br>
us into the temple incorruptible.<br>
 16:10 For he who desireth to be saved looketh not<br>
unto the man, but unto him that dwelleth in him and<br>
speaketh in him, wondering that he had never before<br>
heard him speaking such words out of his mouth, or<br>
even desired to hear. This is the spiritual temple<br>
built by the Lord.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 17<br>
 17:1 |So far as it is possible for me to show you<br>
these things with simplicity, my mind and soul hopeth<br>
that I have not omitted any of the things that pertain<br>
unto salvation;<br>
 17:2 for if I write unto you concerning the things<br>
that are at hand, or the things that will be<br>
hereafter, ye would not be able to understand them,<br>
because they are couched in parables. These things,<br>
therefore, are thus.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 18<br>
 18:1 |Let us pass on now to another kind of knowledge<br>
and instruction. There are two paths of instruction<br>
and authority -- the one that of light, and the other<br>
that of darkness. But there is a great difference<br>
between the two paths. For over the one are appointed<br>
as illuminators the angels of God, over the other the<br>
angels of Satan;<br>
 18:2 on the one side is he who is Lord from<br>
everlasting to everlasting, on the other is the ruler<br>
of the world that now lieth in wickedness.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 19<br>
 19:1 |Now, the path of life is this: If any one<br>
wishes to travel to the appointed place, let him<br>
hasten by means of his works. Now, the knowledge of<br>
walking in it that is given unto us is of this kind:<br>
 19:2 Thou shalt love him that made thee, thou shalt<br>
fear him that formed thee, thou shalt glorify him that<br>
redeemed thee from death. Thou shalt be simple in<br>
heart, and rich in spirit; thou shalt not cleave unto<br>
them that go in the path of death. Thou shalt hate<br>
whatever is not pleasing unto God; thou shalt hate all<br>
hypocrisy; thou shalt not abandon the commandments of<br>
the Lord;<br>
 19:3 thou shalt not exalt thyself; thou shalt be<br>
humble in all things; thou shalt not take glory unto<br>
thyself; thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy<br>
neighbour; thou shalt not take audacity into thy soul.<br>
 19:4 Thou shalt not commit fornication, thou shalt<br>
not commit adultery. Thou shalt not pollute thyself<br>
with mankind: let not the word of God go forth from<br>
thee in corruption. Thou shalt not accept the person<br>
of any to reprove any man for transgression. Thou<br>
shalt be gentle, thou shalt be quiet; thou shalt<br>
tremble at the words that thou hast heard; thou shalt<br>
not bear malice against thy brother;<br>
 19:5 thou shalt not doubt whether a thing shall be<br>
or not; thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in<br>
vain. Thou shalt love thy neighbour beyond thine own<br>
soul; thou shalt not kill a child by abortion, neither<br>
shalt thou destroy it after it is born. Thou shalt not<br>
remove thy hand from thy son or thy daughter, but<br>
shalt teach them from their youth the fear of the<br>
Lord.<br>
 19:6 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods;<br>
thou shalt not be an extortioner; thou shalt not<br>
cleave with thy soul unto the proud, but thou shalt<br>
have thy conversation with the lowly and the just.<br>
Receive as blessings the troubles that come unto thee,<br>
knowing that without God nothing happens.<br>
 19:7 Thou shalt not be double-minded nor<br>
double-tongued, for to be double-tongued is the snare<br>
of death. Thou shalt submit thyself to thy masters as<br>
to the image of God, with shame and fear. Thou shalt<br>
not give commands with bitterness to thy servant and<br>
thy handmaid, who hope in the same God as thou dost,<br>
lest, perchance, thou cease to fear God, who is over<br>
both. For he came not to call men with respect of<br>
persons, but to call those whom the Spirit had<br>
prepared.<br>
 19:8 Thou shalt communicate in all things with thy<br>
neighbour, and shalt not say that things are thine<br>
own. For if ye be partners in that which is<br>
incorruptible, how much more in the things that are<br>
corruptible? Thou shalt not be hasty of speech, for<br>
the mouth is a snare of death. As far as thou art<br>
able, thou shalt be pure concerning thy soul.<br>
 19:9 Be not a stretcher forth of thy hand in<br>
receiving, and a drawer back of it in giving. Thou<br>
shalt love, as the apple of thine eye, every one that<br>
speaketh unto thee the word of the Lord.<br>
 19:10 Thou shalt remember the day of judgment by<br>
night and by day; and thou shalt seek out every day<br>
the persons of the saints.<br>
 19:11 Thou shalt not doubt to give, nor shalt thou<br>
murmur in giving. Give to every one that asketh thee,<br>
and thou shalt know who is the good recompenser of the<br>
reward. Thou shalt take care of that which thou hast<br>
received, neither adding thereto, nor taking<br>
therefrom. Thou shalt hate the evil man unto the end,<br>
and shalt judge justly.<br>
 19:12 Thou shalt not make a schism, but shalt make<br>
peace by bringing adversaries together. Thou shalt<br>
make confession of thy sins. Thou shalt not go unto<br>
prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way of<br>
life, either labouring by means of the word and<br>
proceeding to exhort, and practising to save the soul<br>
by the word, or thou shalt work by thy hands for the<br>
redemption of thy sins.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 20<br>
 20:1 |But the path of darkness is crooked and full of<br>
cursing, for it is the path of eternal death and<br>
punishment, in which way are the things that destroy<br>
the soul. Idolatry, boldness, the pride of power,<br>
hypocrisy, double-heartedness, adultery, murder, rape,<br>
haughtiness, transgression, deceit, malice, self-will,<br>
witchcraft, sorcery, covetousness, want of the fear of<br>
God.<br>
 20:2 Here are they who are persecutors of the good,<br>
haters of truth, lovers of lies; they who know not the<br>
reward of righteousness, who cleave not to what is<br>
good nor unto just judgment; who attend not to the<br>
widow and the orphan; who are awake not unto the fear<br>
of God, but unto evil; from whom meekness and patience<br>
are afar off; who love the things that are vain, who<br>
follow after recompense, who pity not the poor, who<br>
labour not for him who is in trouble; who are prompt<br>
to evil-speaking, who know not him that made them;<br>
murderers of children, corruptors of the image of God;<br>
who turn away from the poor man and oppress the<br>
afflicted; advocates of the rich, unjust judges of the<br>
poor, sinners in all things.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 21<br>
 21:1 |It is therefore right that he who has learned<br>
the ordinances of the Lord, even as many as have been<br>
written beforehand, should walk in them. For he who<br>
doeth these things shall be glorified in the Kingdom<br>
of God, but he who chooseth the contrary things shall<br>
perish together with his works. On this account is the<br>
resurrection; on this account is the retribution.<br>
 21:2 I ask those who are of high estate among you,<br>
if ye will receive any friendly advice from me, keep<br>
those with you toward whom ye may do what is<br>
honourable. Fail not in so doing.<br>
 21:3 The day is at hand in which everything shall<br>
perish together with the evil one; the Lord is nigh at<br>
hand, and his reward also.<br>
 21:4 Again and again do I ask you, be ye good<br>
lawgivers over yourselves, be ye good advisers of<br>
yourselves. Abide faithful counsellors of one another;<br>
take out of the midst of you all hypocrisy,<br>
 21:5 and may God, who ruleth the whole world, give<br>
you wisdom, understanding, science, knowledge of his<br>
ordinances, and patience.<br>
 21:6 And be ye taught of God, inquiring what the<br>
Lord seeketh of you, and so work that ye may be found<br>
saved in the day of judgment.<br>
 21:7 But if there is any memory of that which is<br>
good, remember me while ye practise these things, that<br>
both your desire and your watching may turn unto some<br>
good.<br>
 21:8 I beseech you this, asking it as a favour. So<br>
long as the good vessel is with you, fail not in any<br>
of these things, but seek them out without ceasing,<br>
and fulfil all the commandments, for these things are<br>
worthy.<br>
 21:9 Therefore I have been the more anxious to write<br>
unto you, so far as I was able, to the end that I<br>
might make you glad. Farewell, children of love and<br>
peace; the God of glory and of all grace be with your<br>
spirit. Amen.</p>
