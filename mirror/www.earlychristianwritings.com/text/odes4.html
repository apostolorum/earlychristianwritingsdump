<p>In his commentary on the Odes, Charlesworth notes : </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The date of the <i>Odes</i> has caused considerable interest. H. J. Drijvers contends
        that they are as late as the 3d century. L. Abramowski places them in the latter half of
        the 2d century. B. McNeil argued that they are contemporaneous with <i>4 Ezra</i>, the <i>Shepherd
        of Hermas</i>, Polycarp, and Valentinus (ca. 100 C.E.). Most scholars date them sometime
        around the middle of the 2d century, but if they are heavily influenced by Jewish
        apocalyptic thought and especially the ideas in the Dead Sea Scrolls, a date long after
        100 is unlikely....&nbsp; </p>

        <p>The 11th ode was found among the Bodmer Papyri in a 3d-century Gk manuscript (no. 11).
        Five were translated into Coptic in the 4th century and used to illustrate the <i>Pistis
        Sophia</i> (<i>Odes Sol.</i> 1, 5, 6, 22, and 25). Also in the 4th century Ode 19 was
        quoted by Lactantius (<i>Div. Inst.</i> 4.12.3). In the 10th century a scribe copied the <i>Odes</i>
        in Syriac, but only <i>Odes Sol.</i> 17:7-42:20 are preserved (British Museum ms. Add.
        14538). In the 15th century another scribe copied them into Syriac, but again the
        beginning is lost (John Rylands Library Cod. Syr. 9 contains only <i>Odes Sol.</i>
        3.1b-42:20).&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>--The Anchor Bible Dictionary</i>, v. 6, p. 114]</p>

            <li>The Lord is on my head like a crown, and I shall never be without Him. </li>
            <li>Plaited for me is the crown of truth, and it caused Your branches to blossom in me. </li>
            <li>For it is not like a parched crown that blossoms not; </li>
            <li>For You live upon my head, and have blossomed upon me. </li>
            <li>Your fruits are full and complete; they are full of Your salvation.... </li>

          Ode 3 </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>... I am putting on the love of the Lord. </li>
            <li>And His members are with Him, and I am dependent on them; and He loves me. </li>
            <li>For I should not have known how to love the Lord, if He had not continuously loved me. </li>
            <li>Who is able to distinguish love, except him who is loved? </li>
            <li>I love the Beloved and I myself love Him, and where His rest is, there also am I. </li>
            <li>And I shall be no stranger, because there is no jealousy with the Lord Most High and
              Merciful. </li>
            <li>I have been united to Him, because the lover has found the Beloved, because I love Him
              that is the Son, I shall become a son. </li>
            <li>Indeed he who is joined to Him who is immortal, truly shall be immortal. </li>
            <li>And he who delights in the Life will become living. </li>
            <li>This is the Spirit of the Lord, which is not false, which teaches the sons of men to
              know His ways. </li>
            <li>Be wise and understanding and awakened. <br>
              Hallelujah. </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 align="center">Ode 4 </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>No man can pervert Your holy place, O my God; nor can he change it, and put it in
              another place. </li>
            <li>Because he has no power over it; for Your sanctuary You designed before You made special
              places. </li>
            <li>The ancient one shall not be perverted by those which are inferior to it. You have given
              Your heart, O Lord, to Your believers. </li>
            <li>Never will You be idle, nor will You be without fruits; </li>
            <li>For one hour of Your faith is more excellent than all days and years. </li>
            <li>For who shall put on Your grace and be rejected? </li>
            <li>Because Your seal is known; and Your creatures are known to it. </li>
            <li>And Your hosts possess it, and the elect archangels are clothed with it. </li>
            <li>You have given to us Your fellowship, not that You were in need of us, but that we are
              always in need of You. </li>
            <li>Shower upon us Your gentle rain, and open Your bountiful springs which abundantly supply
              us with milk and honey. </li>
            <li>For there is no regret with You; that You should regret anything which You have
              promised; </li>
            <li>Since the result was manifest to You. </li>
            <li>For that which You gave, You gave freely, so that no longer will You draw back and take
              them again. </li>
            <li>For all was manifest to You as God, and was set in order from the beginning before You. </li>
            <li>And You, O Lord, have made all. <br>
              Hallelujah. </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 align="center">Ode 5 </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>I praise You, O Lord, because I love You. </li>
            <li>O Most High, forsake me not, for You are my hope. </li>
            <li>Freely did I receive Your grace, may I live by it. </li>
            <li>My persecutors will come but let them not see me. </li>
            <li>Let a cloud of darkness fall upon their eyes; and let an air of thick darkness obscure
              them. </li>
            <li>And let them have no light to see, so that they cannot seize me. </li>
            <li>Let their designs become hardened, so that whatever they have conspired shall return
              upon their own heads. </li>
            <li>For they have devised a plan, but it was not for them. </li>
            <li>They prepared themselves maliciously, but they were found to be impotent. </li>
            <li>Indeed my confidence is upon the Lord, and I will not fear. </li>
            <li>And because the Lord is my salvation, I will not fear. </li>
            <li>And He is as a woven crown upon my head, and I shall not be shaken. </li>
            <li>Even if everything should be shaken, I shall stand firm. </li>
            <li>And though all things visible should perish, I shall not die; </li>
            <li>Because the Lord is with me, and I with Him. <br>
              Hallelujah. </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 align="center">Ode 6 </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>As the wind glides through the harp and the strings speak, </li>
            <li>So the Spirit of the Lord speaks through my members, and I speak through His love. </li>
            <li>For He destroys whatever is alien, and everything is of the Lord. </li>
            <li>For thus it was from the beginning, and will be until the end. </li>
            <li>So that nothing shall be contrary, and nothing shall rise up against Him. </li>
            <li>The Lord has multiplied his knowledge, and He was zealous that those things should be
              known which through His grace have been given to us. </li>
            <li>And His praise He gave us on account of His name, our spirits praise His Holy Spirit. </li>
            <li>For there went forth a stream, and it became a river great and broad; indeed it carried
              away everything, and it shattered and brought it to the Temple. </li>
            <li>And the barriers which were built by men were not able to restrain it, nor even the arts
              of them who habitually restrain water. </li>
            <li>For it spread over the surface of all the earth, and it filled everything. </li>
            <li>Then all the thirsty upon the earth drank, and thirst was relieved and quenched; </li>
            <li>For from the Most High the drink was given. </li>
            <li>Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted with His
              water. </li>
            <li>They have refreshed the parched lips, and have aroused the paralyzed will. </li>
            <li>Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death. </li>
            <li>And limbs which have collapsed, they have restored and set up. </li>
            <li>They gave strength for their coming, and light for their eyes. </li>
            <li>Because everyone recognized them as the Lord's, and lived by the living water of
              eternity. <br>
              Hallelujah. </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 align="center">Ode 7 </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>As is the course of anger over wickedness, so is the course of joy over the Beloved; and
              brings in of its fruits unhindered. </li>
            <li>My joy is the Lord and my course is towards Him, this path of mine is beautiful. </li>
            <li>For there is a Helper for me, the Lord. He has generously shown Himself to me in His
              simplicity, because His kindness has diminished His dreadfulness. </li>
            <li>He became like me, that I might receive Him. In form He was considered like me, that I
              might put Him on. </li>
            <li>And I trembled not when I saw Him, because He was gracious to me. </li>
            <li>Like my nature He became, that I might understand Him. And like my form, that I might
              not turn away from Him. </li>
            <li>The Father of knowledge is the Word of knowledge. </li>
            <li>He who created wisdom is wiser than His works. </li>
            <li>And He who created me when yet I was not knew what I would do when I came into being. </li>
            <li>On account of this He was gracious to me in His abundant grace, and allowed me to ask
              from Him and to benefit from His sacrifice. </li>
            <li>For He it is who is incorrupt, the perfection of the worlds and their Father. </li>
            <li>He has allowed Him to appear to them that are His own; in order that they may recognize
              Him that made them, and not suppose that they came of themselves. </li>
            <li>For towards knowledge He has set His way, he has widened it and lengthened it and
              brought it to complete perfection. </li>
            <li>And has set over it the traces of His light, and it proceeded from the beginning until
              the end. </li>
            <li>For by Him He was served, and He was pleased by the Son. </li>
            <li>And because of his salvation He will possess everything. And the Most High will be known
              by His holy ones: </li>
            <li>To announce to those who have songs of the coming of the Lord, that they may go forth to
              meet Him and may sing to Him, with joy and with the harp of many tones. </li>
            <li>The Seers shall go before Him, and they shall be seen before Him. </li>
            <li>And they shall praise the Lord in His love, because He is near and does see. </li>
            <li>And hatred shall be removed from the earth, and with jealousy it shall be drowned. </li>
            <li>For ignorance was destroyed upon it, because the knowledge of the Lord arrived upon it. </li>
            <li>Let the singers sing the grace of the Lord Most High, and let them bring their songs. </li>
            <li>And let their heart be like the day, and their gentle voices like the majestic beauty of
              the Lord. </li>
            <li>And let there not be anyone who breathes that is without knowledge or voice. </li>
            <li>For He gave a mouth to His creation: to open the voice of the mouth towards Him, and to
              praise Him. </li>
            <li>Confess His power and declare His grace. <br>
              Hallelujah. </li>

              heart to the lips. </li>
            <li>In order to bring forth fruits to the Lord, a holy life; and to talk with watchfulness
              in His light. </li>
            <li>Rise up and stand erect, you who sometimes were brought low. </li>
            <li>You who were in silence, speak, for your mouth has been opened. </li>
            <li>You who were despised, from henceforth be lifted up, for your Righteousness has been
              lifted up; </li>
            <li>For the right hand of the Lord is with you, and He will be your Helper. </li>
            <li>And peace was prepared for you, before what may be your war. </li>
            <li>Hear the word of truth, and receive the knowledge of the Most High. </li>
            <li>Your flesh may not understand that which I am about to say to you; nor your garment that
              which I am about to show you. </li>
            <li>Keep my mystery, you who are kept by it; keep my faith, you who are kept by it. </li>
            <li>And understand my knowledge, you who know me in truth; love me with affection, you who
              love; </li>
            <li>For I turn not my face from my own, because I know them. </li>
            <li>And before they had existed, I recognized them; and imprinted a seal on their faces. </li>

        <p align="center"><font size="+2">A</font>s the eyes of a son to his father,<br>
        so my eyes turn to you, O Lord, at all times,<br>
        for with you are my consolation and joy. </p>
        <p align="center">Do not turn your mercy from me, O Lord,<br>
        nor your kindness,<br>
        but stretch out your right hand,<br>
        and be my guide to the end. </p>
        <p align="center">Care for me,<br>
        save me from evil. </p>
        <p align="center">and let your gentleness<br>
        and love be with me. </p>
        <p align="center">Teach me to sing of truth,<br>
        that I may engender fruit in you. </p>
        <p align="center">Open the harp of your holy spirit<br>
        so I may praise you, Lord, with all its notes. </p>
        <p align="center">From your sea of mercy,<br>
        help me,<br>
        help me in my hour of need. </p>

        Ode XV </h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="+2">A</font>s the sun is joy for those who seek daybreak,<br>
        so my joy is the Lord. </p>
        <p align="center">He is my sun and his rays have lifted me up<br>
        and chased all darkness from my face. </p>
        <p align="center">In him I have acquired eyes<br>
        and seen his sacred day. </p>
        <p align="center">I have acquired ears<br>
        and heard his truth. </p>
        <p align="center">I have acquired knowledge<br>
        and been made happy in him. </p>
        <p align="center">I left the way of error and went to him<br>
        and was saved. </p>
        <p align="center">According to his bounty he gave me,<br>
        according to his beauty he made me. </p>
        <p align="center">I found purity through his name,<br>
        I shed corruption through his grace. </p>
        <p align="center">Death has died before my countenance,<br>
        hell is abolished by my word. </p>
        <p align="center">A deathless life appears in the land of the Lord,<br>
        is known to those with faith,<br>
        and given those with faith, uncessantly. </p>

        Ode XVII </h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="+2">I </font>was crowned by God,<br>
        by a crown alive. </p>
        <p align="center">and my Lord justified me.<br>
        He became my certain salvation. </p>
        <p align="center">I was freed from myself<br>
        and uncondemned.<br>
        The chains fell from my wrists. </p>
        <p align="center">I took on the face and ways of a new person,<br>
        walked in him and was redeemed. </p>
        <p align="center">The thought of truth drove me.<br>
        I walked to it and did not wander off. </p>
        <p align="center">Those who saw me were amazed,<br>
        supposing me to be a strange person. </p>
        <p align="center">He who knew me and brought me up<br>
        is the summit of perfection. </p>
        <p align="center">He glorified me by kindness<br>
        and lifted my thought to truth </p>
        <p align="center">and showed me his way.<br>
        I opened closed doors, </p>
        <p align="center">shattered bars of iron.<br>
        My own shackles melted. </p>
        <p align="center">Nothing appeared closed<br>
        because I was the door to everything. </p>
        <p align="center">I freed slaves,<br>
        left no man in bonds, </p>
        <p align="center">I spread my knowledge<br>
        and love </p>
        <p align="center">and sowed my fruits in hearts<br>
        and transformed them. </p>
        <p align="center">I blessed them. They lived.<br>
        I gathered them and saved them. </p>
        <p align="center">They became the limbs of my body<br>
        and I was their head. </p>
        <p align="center"><em>Glory to you, our head, Our Lord Messiah.</em> </p>

        Ode XIX </h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="+2">A</font> cup of milk I was offered<br>
        and I drank its sweetness as the delight of the Lord. </p>
        <p align="center">The Son is the cup<br>
        and he who was milked is the Father,<br>
        and he who milked him is the Holy Ghost. </p>
        <p align="center">His breasts were full<br>
        and his milk should not drip out wastefully. </p>
        <p align="center">The Holy Ghost opened the Fathers raiment<br>
        and mingled the milk from the Father`s two breasts. </p>
        <p align="center">and gave that mingling to the world, which was unknowing.<br>
        Those who drink it are near his right hand. </p>
        <p align="center">The Spirit opened the Virgin`s womb<br>
        and she received the milk. </p>
        <p align="center">The Virgin became a mother of great mercy;<br>
        she labored, but not in pain, and bore a son.<br>
        No midwife came. </p>
        <p align="center">She bore him as if she were a man,<br>
        openly, with dignity, with kindness.<br>
        She loved him, and swaddled him, and revealed his majesty. </p>
        <h3 align="center"><br>
        Ode XXI </h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="+2">I </font>raised my arms high<br>
        to the grace of the Lord, </p>
        <p align="center">for he had cast off my bonds.<br>
        My helper had lifted me to his grace and salvation. </p>
        <p align="center">I discarded darkness<br>
        and clothed myself in Light. </p>
        <p align="center">My soul acquired a body<br>
        free from sorrow,<br>
        affliction or pain. </p>
        <p align="center">The thought of the Lord restored me.<br>
        I fed on his incorruptible fellowship. </p>
        <p align="center">And I was raised in the Light<br>
        and went to him,<br>
        near him, <br>
        praising and proclaiming him. </p>
        <p align="center">He made my heart flood into my mouth,<br>
        made it shine on my lips. </p>
        <p align="center">On my face the exultation of the Lord increased,<br>
        and his praise. </p>
        <h3 align="center"><br>
        Ode XXIV </h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="+2">T</font>he dove flew over the head of the Messiah<br>
        who was her head,<br>
        and she sang over him<br>
        and her voice was heard. </p>
        <p align="center">The inhabitants were afraid<br>
        and travelers shuddered. </p>
        <p align="center">Birds took flight<br>
        and all creeping things died in their holes. </p>
        <p align="center">Abysses opened and closed.<br>
        They were seeking God like women in labor. </p>
        <p align="center">They had no food.<br>
        None belonged to them. </p>
        <p align="center">The abysses sank and were sealed by the Lord<br>
        and people perished in their own thought,<br>
        ancient and new. </p>
        <p align="center">Everyone was imperfect and died.<br>
        They could say nothing. </p>
        <p align="center">The Lord destroyed the immagination<br>
        of all who did not have his truth. </p>
        <p align="center">They were weak in wisdom<br>
        and were rejected. They lacked his truth. </p>
        <p align="center">The Lord disclosed his way,<br>
        and spread his grace in alien lands. </p>
        <p align="center">Those who understood<br>
        know holiness. </p>
