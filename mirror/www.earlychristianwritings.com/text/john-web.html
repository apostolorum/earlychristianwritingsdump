<H1>The Gospel According to John </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the beginning was the Word, and the 
Word was with God, and the Word was God. <A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same was in the beginning with God. 
<A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All things were made through him. 
Without him was not anything made that has been made. <A name=C1V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In him was life, and 
the life was the light of men. <A name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The light shines in the darkness, and 
the darkness hasn't <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N1">overcome</A> it. <A 
name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There came a man, sent from God, whose 
name was John. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same came as a witness, that he 
might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. <A 
name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. <A 
name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The 
true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world. 
<P><A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He was in the world, and the world was 
made through him, and the world didn't recognize him. <A name=C1V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He came to his own, 
and those who were his own didn't receive him. <A name=C1V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as many as 
received him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who 
believe in his name: <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who were born not of blood, nor of the 
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <A name=C1V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Word became 
flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only 
Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <A name=C1V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John testified 
about him. He cried out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes 
after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'" <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From his fullness 
we all received grace upon grace. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the law was given through Moses. 
Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <A name=C1V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No one has seen God 
at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has 
declared him. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is John's testimony, when the Jews 
sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 
<P><A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He confessed, and didn't deny, but he 
confessed, "I am not the Christ." 
<P><A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They asked him, "What then? Are you 
Elijah?" 
<P>He said, "I am not." 
<P>"Are you the Prophet?" 
<P>He answered, "No." 
<P><A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore to him, "Who are 
you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about 
yourself?" 
<P><A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said, "I am the voice of one crying 
in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet 
said." 
<P><A name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The ones who had been sent were from 
the Pharisees. <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They asked him, "Why then do you 
baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" 
<P><A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John answered them, "I baptize in 
water, but among you stands one whom you don't know. <A name=C1V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is the one who 
comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to 
loosen." <A name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things were done in Bethany 
beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
<P><A name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The next day, he saw Jesus coming to 
him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <A 
name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is he of whom I said, 'After me 
comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.' <A 
name=C1V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be 
revealed to Israel." <A name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John testified, saying, "I have seen 
the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him. <A 
name=C1V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On 
whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is 
he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.' <A name=C1V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I have seen, and have testified that 
this is the Son of God." 
<P><A name=C1V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again, the next day, John was standing 
with two of his disciples, <A name=C1V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he looked at Jesus as he walked, 
and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" <A name=C1V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The two disciples heard him speak, and 
they followed Jesus. <A name=C1V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus turned, and saw them following, 
and said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"What are you looking for?"</FONT> 
<P>They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), 
"where are you staying?" 
<P><A name=C1V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Come, and see."</FONT> 
<P>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It 
was about <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N2">the tenth 
hour.</A> <A name=C1V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of the two who heard John, and 
followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. <A name=C1V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He first found his 
own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, 
being interpreted, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N3">Christ</A>). <A 
name=C1V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"You 
are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas"</FONT> (which is by 
interpretation, Peter). <A name=C1V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the next day, he was determined to 
go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Follow me."</FONT> <A name=C1V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the 
city of Andrew and Peter. <A name=C1V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Philip found Nathanael, and said to 
him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: 
Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." 
<P><A name=C1V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nathanael said to him, "Can any good 
thing come out of Nazareth?" 
<P>Philip said to him, "Come and see." 
<P><A name=C1V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and 
said about him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no 
deceit!"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nathanael said to him, "How do you know 
me?" 
<P>Jesus answered him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Before Philip called you, when you 
were under the fig tree, I saw you."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are 
the Son of God! You are King of Israel!" 
<P><A name=C1V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you 
believe? You will see greater things than these!"</FONT> <A name=C1V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to him, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Most assuredly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven 
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of 
Man."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The third day, there was a marriage in 
Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there. <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus also was invited, with his 
disciples, to the marriage. <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother 
said to him, "They have no wine." 
<P><A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to her, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not 
yet come."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His mother said to the servants, 
"Whatever he says to you, do it." <A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were six water pots of stone 
set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N4">two or three metretes</A> 
apiece. <A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Fill the water pots with water."</FONT> They filled them up to 
the brim. <A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast."</FONT> 
So they took it. <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the ruler of the feast tasted the 
water now become wine, and didn't know where it came from (but the servants who 
had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom, <A 
name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said to him, "Everyone serves the 
good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is 
worse. You have kept the good wine until now!" <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This beginning of 
his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his 
disciples believed in him. 
<P><A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After this, he went down to Capernaum, 
he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few 
days. <A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, 
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He found in the temple those who sold 
oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. <A name=C2V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He made a whip of 
cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he 
poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables. <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To those who sold 
the doves, he said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Take these things out of here! Don't 
make my Father's house a marketplace!"</FONT> <A name=C2V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His disciples 
remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up." 
<P><A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore answered him, "What 
sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?" 
<P><A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it 
up."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six 
years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?" <A

he did. <A name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

because he knew everyone, <A name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.

<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Galilee. <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

us all things." 
<P><A name=C4V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do you speak with her?" <A

the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the

him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."

<P><A name=C4V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me 
everything that I did." <A name=C4V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when the Samaritans came to him, 
they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. <A name=C4V41><FONT

believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know

<P><A name=C4V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After the two days he went out from 
there and went into Galilee. <A name=C4V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Jesus himself testified that a 
prophet has no honor in his own country. <A name=C4V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when he came into Galilee, the 
Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at 
the feast, for they also went to the feast. <A name=C4V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus came 
therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was 
a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. <A name=C4V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he heard that 
Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he 
would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <A

size=-1><SUP>4:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said to him, <FONT

believe."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C4V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

down before my child dies." <A name=C4V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to him, <FONT

that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. <A name=C4V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he was now going 
down, his servants met him and reported, saying "Your child lives!" <A

he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to 
him, "Yesterday at the <A

left him." <A name=C4V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

hour in which Jesus said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Your son lives."</FONT> He 
believed, as did his whole house. <A name=C4V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee. 
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches. <A

these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, 
waiting for the moving of the water; <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for an angel of the Lord went down at 
certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first 
after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had. <A

Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he

<P><A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have 
no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm 
coming, another steps down before me." 
<P><A name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>Now it was the Sabbath on that day. <A name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

"It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat." 
<P><A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C5V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C5V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <A name=C5V19><FONT

were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray him. <A

said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"For this cause have I said to you that no one can 
come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C6V66><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

back, and walked no more with him. <A name=C6V67><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<FONT color=#ff0000>"You don't also want to go away, do you?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C6V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C6V70><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

devil?"</FONT> <A name=C6V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon 
Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve. 
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things, Jesus was walking in 
Galilee, for he wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. <A

the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. <A name=C7V3><FONT

therefore said to him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples 
also may see your works which you do. <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For no one does anything in secret, and 
himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the 
world." <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him. 
<P><A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. <A

feast, and said, "Where is he?" <A name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

but he leads the multitude astray." <A name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of the Jews. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. <A name=C7V15><FONT

marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?" 
<P><A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

temple, teaching and saying, <FONT color=#ff0000>"You both know me, and know

<P><A name=C7V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. <A

him. They said, "When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than those which 
this man has done, will he?" <A name=C7V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees heard the multitude 
murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees 
sent officers to arrest him. 
<P><A name=C7V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

themselves, "Where will this man go that we won't find him? Will he go to the

<P><A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>7:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said this about the Spirit, 
which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet 
given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified. 
<P><A name=C7V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many of the multitude therefore, when 
they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet." <A name=C7V41><FONT

was?" <A name=C7V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the law is accursed." 
<P><A name=C7V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

being one of them) said to them, <A name=C7V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

first hears from him personally and knows what he does?" 
<P><A name=C7V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee." 
<P><A name=C7V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now very early in the morning, he came 
again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught 
them. <A name=C8V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a 
woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst, <A name=C8V4><FONT

"Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. <A name=C8V5><FONT

Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her?" <A

said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. 
<P>But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. <A

when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, <FONT

her."</FONT> <A name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, 
even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the 
middle. <A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

you?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

now on, sin no more."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

"You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid." 
<P><A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

called the parents of him who had received his sight, <A name=C9V19><FONT

him. He will speak for himself." <A name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. <A name=C9V23><FONT

become his disciples, do you?" 
<P><A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. <A name=C11V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It was that Mary 
who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose 
brother, Lazarus, was sick. <A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sisters therefore sent to him, 
saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick." <A

size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Jesus heard it, he said, <FONT

God's Son may be glorified by it."</FONT> <A name=C11V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Jesus loved 
Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <A name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. <A name=C11V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then after this he 
said to the disciples, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Let's go into Judea again."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C11V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples told him, "Rabbi, the 
Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?" 
<P><A name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, 
he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world. </FONT><A

he said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, 
but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples therefore said, "Lord, 
if he has fallen asleep, he will recover." 
<P><A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but 
they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep. <A name=C11V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So Jesus said to 
them plainly then, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Lazarus is dead. </FONT><A

him."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thomas therefore, who is called <A

<P><A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

had been in the tomb four days already. <A name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about 
<A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N14">fifteen stadia</A> away. 
<A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many of the Jews had joined the women 
around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. <A

coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house. <A name=C11V21><FONT

said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have 
died. <A name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of God, God will give you." <A name=C11V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." 
<P><A name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to her, <FONT

he die, yet will he live. </FONT><A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C11V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have 
come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the 
world." 
<P><A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When she had said this, she went away, 
and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is 
calling you." 
<P><A name=C11V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When she heard this, she arose 
quickly, and went to him. <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Jesus had not yet come into the 
village, but was in the place where Martha met him. <A name=C11V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the Jews who 
were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she 
rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to 
weep there." <A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore when Mary came to where 
Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you 
would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died." 
<P><A name=C11V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, 
and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was 
troubled, <A name=C11V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Where 
have you laid him?"</FONT> 
<P>They told him, "Lord, come and see." 
<P><A name=C11V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus wept. 
<P><A name=C11V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore said, "See how much 
affection he had for him!" <A name=C11V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, 
who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?" 
<P><A name=C11V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore, again groaning in 
himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <A 
name=C11V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Take 
away the stone."</FONT> 
<P>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this time 
there is a stench, for he has been dead four days." 
<P><A name=C11V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to her, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's 
glory?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C11V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they took away the stone from the 
place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Father, I thank you that you listened to me. </FONT><A 
name=C11V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>I know that you

this, that they may believe that you sent me."</FONT> <A name=C11V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said 
this, he cried with a loud voice, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Lazarus, come 
out!"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C11V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He who was dead came out, bound hand 
and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. 
<P>Jesus said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Free him, and let him go."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C11V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore many of the Jews, who came 
to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. <A name=C11V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of them 
went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. <A 
name=C11V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests therefore and the 
Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we doing? For this man does 
many signs. <A name=C11V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If we leave him alone like this, 
everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our 
place and our nation." 
<P><A name=C11V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, 
being high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all, <A 
name=C11V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>nor do you consider that it is 
advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole 
nation not perish." <A name=C11V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he didn't say this of himself, but 
being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 
<A name=C11V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and not for the nation only, but that 
he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered 
abroad. <A name=C11V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So from that day forward they took 
counsel that they might put him to death. <A name=C11V54><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country 
near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his 
disciples. 
<P><A name=C11V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the Passover of the Jews was at 
hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify 
themselves. <A name=C11V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they sought for Jesus and spoke 
one with another, as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't 
coming to the feast at all?" <A name=C11V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests and the 
Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, 
that they might seize him. 
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then six days before the Passover, 
Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from 
the dead. <A name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they made him a supper there. Martha 
served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him. <A 
name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary, therefore, took a <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N15">pound</A> of ointment of 
pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet 
with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. <A 
name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one 
of his disciples, who would betray him, said, <A name=C12V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Why wasn't this 
ointment sold for <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N16">three 
hundred denarii,</A> and given to the poor?" <A name=C12V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he said this, 
not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the 
money box, used to steal what was put into it. <A name=C12V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my 
burial. </FONT><A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>For you always have 
the poor with you, but you don't always have me."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A large crowd therefore of the Jews 
learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that 
they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. <A 
name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the chief priests conspired to put 
Lazarus to death also, <A name=C12V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because on account of him many of the 
Jews went away and believed in Jesus. 
<P><A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the next day a great multitude had 
come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <A 
name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they took the branches of the palm 
trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who 
comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!" 
<P><A name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus, having found a young donkey, 
sat on it. As it is written, <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion. 
Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt." <A name=C12V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His disciples 
didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they 
remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done 
these things to him. <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude therefore that was with 
him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was 
testifying about it. <A name=C12V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause also the multitude went 
and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign. <A name=C12V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees 
therefore said among themselves, "See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the 
world has gone after him." 
<P><A name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were certain Greeks among 
those that went up to worship at the feast. <A name=C12V21><FONT

came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, 
we want to see Jesus." <A name=C12V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Philip came and told Andrew, and in 
turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus. <A name=C12V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered 
them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

<P><A name=C12V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in 
synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in 
secret. </FONT><A name=C18V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things 
which I said."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said this, one of the 
officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the 
high priest like that?" 
<P><A name=C18V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered him, <FONT

you beat me?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C18V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the 
high priest. <A name=C18V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Simon Peter was standing and 
warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You aren't also one of his 
disciples, are you?" 
<P>He denied it, and said, "I am not." 
<P><A name=C18V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of the servants of the high 
priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see 
you in the garden with him?" 
<P><A name=C18V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter therefore denied it again, and 
immediately the rooster crowed. 
<P><A name=C18V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas 
into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the 
Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. <A 
name=C18V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore went out to them, and 
said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?" 
<P><A name=C18V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered him, "If this man 
weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't have delivered him up to you." 
<P><A name=C18V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore said to them, "Take 
him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." 
<P>Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to 
death," <A name=C18V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that the word of Jesus might be 
fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die. 
<P><A name=C18V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore entered again into 
the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" 
<P><A name=C18V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered him, <FONT

me?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C18V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? 
Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?" 
<P><A name=C18V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this 
world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. 
But now my Kingdom is not from here."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C18V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you 
a king then?" 
<P>Jesus answered, <FONT color=#ff0000>"You say that I am a king. For this 
reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I 
should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my 
voice."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C18V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" 
<P>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I 
find no basis for a charge against him. <A name=C18V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But you have a custom, that I should 
release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to 
you the King of the Jews?" 
<P><A name=C18V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they all shouted again, saying, 
"Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber. 
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged 
him. <A name=C19V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The soldiers twisted thorns into a 
crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment. <A 
name=C19V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They kept saying, "Hail, King of the 
Jews!" and they kept slapping him. 
<P><A name=C19V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Pilate went out again, and said to 
them, "Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis 
for a charge against him." 
<P><A name=C19V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore came out, wearing the 
crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!" 
<P><A name=C19V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore the chief priests and 
the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!" 
<P>Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no 
basis for a charge against him." 
<P><A name=C19V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, 
and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God." 
<P><A name=C19V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore Pilate heard this 
saying, he was more afraid. <A name=C19V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He entered into the Praetorium again, 
and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. <A 
name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore said to him, "Aren't 
you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have 
power to crucify you?" 
<P><A name=C19V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given 
to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin."</FONT> 

<P><A name=C19V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At this, Pilate was seeking to release 
him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren't 
Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!" 
<P><A name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Pilate therefore heard these 
words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called 
"The Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha." <A name=C19V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it was the 
Preparation Day of the Passover, at about <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N21">the sixth hour.</A> He said 
to the Jews, "Behold, your King!" 
<P><A name=C19V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They cried out, "Away with him! Away 
with him! Crucify him!" 
<P>Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" 
<P>The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!" 
<P><A name=C19V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then he delivered him to them to be 
crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away. <A name=C19V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He went out, 
bearing his cross, to the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called 
in Hebrew, "Golgotha," <A name=C19V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>where they crucified him, and with him 
two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle. <A name=C19V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate wrote a 
title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE 
KING OF THE JEWS." <A name=C19V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore many of the Jews read this 
title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was 
written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <A name=C19V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests 
of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 
'he said, I am King of the Jews.'" 
<P><A name=C19V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate answered, "What I have written, 
I have written." 
<P><A name=C19V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the soldiers, when they had 
crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; 
and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
<A name=C19V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they said to one another, "Let's 
not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the 
Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, 
<P>&nbsp;"They parted my garments among 
them.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my cloak they cast lots." 
<P>Therefore the soldiers did these things. <A name=C19V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there were 
standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the 
wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <A name=C19V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, 
and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Woman, behold your son!"</FONT> <A name=C19V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then he said to 
the disciple, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Behold, your mother!"</FONT> From that hour, 
the disciple took her to his own home. 
<P><A name=C19V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After this, Jesus, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N22">seeing</A> that all things 
were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"I am thirsty."</FONT> <A name=C19V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now a vessel full of vinegar was set 
there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his 
mouth. <A name=C19V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus therefore had received the 
vinegar, he said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"It is finished."</FONT> He bowed his 
head, and gave up his spirit. 
<P><A name=C19V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore the Jews, because it was the 
Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath 
(for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be 
broken, and that they might be taken away. <A name=C19V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore the 
soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was 
crucified with him; <A name=C19V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but when they came to Jesus, and saw 
that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs. <A name=C19V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However one of the 
soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came 
out. <A name=C19V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He who has seen has testified, and his 
testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe. <A 
name=C19V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For these things happened, that the 
Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him will not be broken." <A 
name=C19V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again another Scripture says, "They 
will look on him whom they pierced." 
<P><A name=C19V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things, Joseph of 
Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked 
of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission. He 
came therefore and took away his body. <A name=C19V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus 
by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N23">a hundred pounds.</A> <A 
name=C19V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they took Jesus' body, and bound it 
in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. <A 
name=C19V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the place where he was 
crucified there was a garden. In the garden a new tomb in which no man had ever 
yet been laid. <A name=C19V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then because of the Jews' Preparation 
Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there. 
<P><A name=C20V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the first day of the week, Mary 
Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone 
taken away from the tomb. <A name=C20V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore she ran and came to Simon 
Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have 
taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid 
him!" 
<P><A name=C20V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore Peter and the other disciple 
went out, and they went toward the tomb. <A name=C20V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They both ran together. The other 
disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first. <A name=C20V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Stooping and 
looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in. <A 
name=C20V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Simon Peter came, following him, 
and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, <A name=C20V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the cloth that 
had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place 
by itself. <A name=C20V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then the other disciple who came 
first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed. <A name=C20V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as yet they 
didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <A name=C20V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the disciples 
went away again to their own homes. 
<P><A name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Mary was standing outside at the 
tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb, <A 
name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and she saw two angels in white 
sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
<A name=C20V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They told her, "Woman, why are you 
weeping?" 
<P>She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know 
where they have laid him." <A name=C20V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When she had said this, she turned 
around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus. 
<P><A name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to her, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?"</FONT> 
<P>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have carried 
him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." 
<P><A name=C20V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to her, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Mary."</FONT> 
<P>She turned and said to him, "Rhabbouni!" which is to say, "Teacher!" 
<P><A name=C20V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to her, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Don't touch me, for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go 
to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to 
my God and your God.'"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C20V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary Magdalene came and told the 
disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her. 
<A name=C20V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore it was evening, on that 
day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the 
disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the 
midst, and said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Peace be to you."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C20V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said this, he showed them 
his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the 
Lord. <A name=C20V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said to them again, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send 
you."</FONT> <A name=C20V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said this, he breathed on 
them, and said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Receive the Holy Spirit! </FONT><A

<P><A name=C20V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came. <A name=C20V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The other 
disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord!" 
<P>But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and 
put my hand into his side, I will not believe." 
<P><A name=C20V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After eight days again his disciples 
were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and

<P><A name=C20V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C20V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>21:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things, Jesus revealed 
himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this 
way. <A name=C21V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, 
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his 
disciples were together. <A name=C21V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going 
fishing." 
<P>They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went out, and 
entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. <A name=C21V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when day had 
already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn't know that it 
was Jesus. <A name=C21V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Children, have you anything to eat?"</FONT> 
<P>They answered him, "No." 
<P><A name=C21V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find 
some."</FONT> 
<P>They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the 
multitude of fish. <A name=C21V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That disciple therefore whom Jesus 
loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" 
<P>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around 
him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <A name=C21V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the other 
disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but 
about <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N25">two hundred 
cubits</A> away), dragging the net full of fish. <A name=C21V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when they got 
out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. 
<A name=C21V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C21V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net 
to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were 
so many, the net wasn't torn. 
<P><A name=C21V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Come and eat breakfast."</FONT> 
<P>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing that it 
was the Lord. 
<P><A name=C21V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Jesus came and took the bread, 
gave it to them, and the fish likewise. <A name=C21V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is now the third time that Jesus 
was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead. <A 
name=C21V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when they had eaten their 
breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Simon, son of Jonah, 
do you love me more than these?"</FONT> 
<P>He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you." 
<P>He said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Feed my lambs."</FONT> <A 
name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to him again a second time, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?"</FONT> 
<P>He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you." 
<P>He said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Tend my sheep."</FONT> <A 
name=C21V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to him the third time, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?"</FONT> 
<P>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Do you have affection for me?"</FONT> He said to him, "Lord, you 
know everything. You know that I have affection for you." 
<P>Jesus said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Feed my sheep. </FONT><A 
name=C21V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>Most assuredly I 
tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted 
to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will 
dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C21V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he said this, signifying by what 
kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Follow me."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C21V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Peter, turning around, saw a 
disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one 
who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is 
going to betray You?" <A name=C21V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, 
"Lord, what about this man?" 
<P><A name=C21V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You 
follow me."</FONT> <A name=C21V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This saying therefore went out among 
the <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/John.htm#N26">brothers</A>, that 
this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, 
but, <FONT color=#ff0000>"If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to 
you?"</FONT> <A name=C21V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is the disciple who testifies 
about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true. <A 
name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There are also many other things which 
Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world 
itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.
