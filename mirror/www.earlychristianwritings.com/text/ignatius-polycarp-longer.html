<P>Having obtained good proof that thy mind is fixed in God as upon an 
immoveable rock, I loudly glorify [His name] that I have been thought worthy [to 
behold] thy blameless face,
which may I ever enjoy in God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art 
clothed, to press forward in thy course, and to exhort all that they may be 
saved. Maintain thy position with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have a 
regard to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with all, even as 
the Lord does with thee. Support
all in love, as also thou doest. Give thyself to prayer without ceasing.
Implore additional understanding to what thou already hast. Be watchful, 
possessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to every man separately, as God enables 
thee.
Bear the infirmities of all, as being a perfect athlete [in the Christian life]: 
where the labour is great, the gain is all the more.</P>

<P>If thou lovest the good disciples, no thanks are due to thee on that account; 
but rather seek by meekness to subdue the more troublesome. Every kind of wound 
is not healed with the same plaster. Mitigate violent attacks [of disease] by 
gentle applications.
Be in all things "wise as a serpent, and harmless as a dove."
For this purpose thou art composed of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest 
deal tenderly
with those [evils] that present themselves visibly before thee. And as respects 
those that are not seen,
pray that [God] would reveal them unto thee, in order that thou mayest be 
wanting in nothing, but mayest abound in every gift. The times call for thee, as 
pilots do for the winds, and as one tossed with tempest seeks for the haven, so 
that both thou [and those under thy care] may attain to God. Be sober as an 
athlete of God: the prize set before thee is immortality and eternal life, of 
which thou art also persuaded. In all things may my soul be for thing,
and my bonds also, which thou hast loved.</P>

but rather seek by meekness to subdue the more troublesome. Every kind of wound 
is not healed with the same plaster. Mitigate violent attacks [of disease] by 
gentle applications.
Be in all things "wise as a serpent, and harmless always as a dove."
For this purpose thou art composed of both soul and body, art both fleshly and 
spiritual, that thou mayest correct those [evils] that present themselves 
visibly before thee; and as respects those that are not seen, mayest pray that 
these should be revealed to thee, so that thou mayest be wanting in nothing, but 
mayest abound in every gift. The times call upon thee to pray. For as the wind 
aids the pilot of a ship, and as havens are advantageous for safety to a 
tempest-tossed vessel, so is also prayer to thee, in order that thou mayest 
attain to God. Be sober as an athlete of God, whose will is immortality and 
eternal life; of which thou art also persuaded. In all things may my soul be for 
thine, and my bonds also, which thou hast loved.</P>

<P>Let not those who seem worthy of credit, but teach strange doctrines,
fill thee with apprehension. Stand firm, as does an anvil which is beaten. It is 
the part of a noble
athlete to be wounded, and yet to conquer. And especially, we ought to bear all 
things for the sake of God, that He also may bear with us. Be ever becoming more 
zealous than what thou art. Weigh carefully the times. Look for Him who is above 
all time, eternal and invisible, yet who became visible for our sakes; 
impalpable and impassible, yet who became passible on our account; and who in 
every kind of way suffered for our sakes.</P>

kingdom. Add more and more to thy diligence; run thy race with increasing 
energy; weigh carefully the times. Whilst thou art here, be a conqueror; for 
here is the course, and there are the crowns. Look for Christ, the Son of God; 
who was before time, yet appeared in time; who was invisible by nature, yet 
visible in the flesh; who was impalpable, and could not be touched, as being 
without a body, but for our sakes became such, might be touched and handled in 
the body; who was impassible as God, but became passible for our sakes as man; 
and who in every kind of way suffered for our sakes.</P>

<P>Let not widows be neglected. Be thou, after the Lord, their protector

without the approval of God, which indeed thou dost not, inasmuch as thou art 
stedfast. Let your assembling together be of frequent
occurrence: seek after all by name.
Do not despise either male or female slaves, yet neither let them be puffed up 
with conceit, but rather let them submit themselves
the more, for the glory of God, that they may obtain from God a better liberty. 
Let them not long to be set free [from slavery] at the public expense, that they 
be not found slaves to their own desires.</P>

<P>Flee evil arts; but all the more discourse in public regarding them.
Speak to my sisters, that they love the Lord, and be satisfied with their 
husbands both in the flesh and spirit. In like manner also, exhort my brethren, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, that they love their wives, even as the Lord the 
Church.
If any one can continue in a state of purity,
to the honour of Him who is Lord of the flesh,
let him so remain without boasting. If he begins to boast, he is undone; and if 
he reckon himself greater than the bishop, he is ruined. But it becomes both men 
and women who marry, to form their union with the approval of the bishop, that 
their marriage may be according to God, and not after their own lust. Let all 
things be done to the honour of God.

your wages. Let none of you be found a deserter. Let your baptism endure as your 
arms; your faith as your helmet; your love as your spear; your patience as a

<P>Seeing that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria is, as report has 
informed me, at peace, through your prayers, I also am the more encouraged, 
resting without anxiety in God,
if indeed by means of suffering I may attain to God, so that, through your 
prayers, I may be found a disciple [of Christ].
It is fitting, O Polycarp, most blessed in God, to assemble a very solemn
council, and to elect one whom you greatly love, and know to be a man of 
activity, who may be designated the messenger of God;
and to bestow on him this honour that he may go into Syria, and glorify your 
ever active love to the praise of Christ. A Christian has not power over 
himself, but must always be ready for
the service of God. Now, this work is both God's and yours, when ye shall have 
completed it to His glory.
For I trust that, through grace, ye are prepared for every good work pertaining 
to God. Knowing, therefore, your energetic love of the truth, I have exhorted 
you by this brief Epistle.</P>
