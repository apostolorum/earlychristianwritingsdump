<H1>Acts </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The first book I wrote, Theophilus, 
concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, <A name=C1V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>until the day in 
which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit 
to the apostles whom he had chosen. <A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To these he also showed himself alive 
after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty 
days, and speaking about God's Kingdom. <A name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being assembled together with them, he 
charged them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Don't depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the 
promise of the Father, which you heard from me. </FONT><A name=C1V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT 
color=#ff0000>For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the 
Holy Spirit not many days from now."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, when they had come together, 
they asked him, "Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?" 
<P><A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"It 
isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within His own 
authority. </FONT><A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>But you will receive 
power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in 
Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the 
earth."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said these things, as they 
were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. <A 
name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While they were looking steadfastly 
into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing, <A 
name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who also said, "You men of Galilee, why 
do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into 
the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky." 
<P><A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they returned to Jerusalem from 
the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey 
away. <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had come in, they went up 
into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, 
Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon 
the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. <A name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All these with one accord continued 
steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women, and Mary the 
mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. 
<P><A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In these days, Peter stood up in the 
midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), 
and said, <A name=C1V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Brothers, it was necessary that this 
Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth 
of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus. <A 
name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he was numbered with us, and 
received his portion in this ministry. <A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this man obtained a field with the 
reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all 
his intestines gushed out. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It became known to everyone who lived 
in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 
'The field of blood.' <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is written in the book of 
Psalms, 
<P>&nbsp;'Let his habitation be made 
desolate,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no one dwell therein,' 
<P>and, 
<P>&nbsp;'Let another take his office.' 
<P><A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Of the men therefore who have 
accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <A 
name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>beginning from the baptism of John, to 
the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with 
us of his resurrection." 
<P><A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They put forward two, Joseph called 
Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They prayed, and 
said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two 
you have chosen <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to take part in this ministry and 
apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place." <A 
name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They drew lots for them, and the lot 
fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the day of Pentecost had come, 
they were all with one accord in one place. <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Suddenly there came 
from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the 
house where they were sitting. <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Tongues like fire appeared and were 
distributed to them, and one sat on each of them. <A name=C2V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were all filled 
with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit 
gave them the ability to speak. <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem 
Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky. <A name=C2V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When this sound was 
heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard 
them speaking in his own language. <A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were all amazed and marveled, 
saying to one another, "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans? <A 
name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How 
do we hear, everyone in our own native language? <A name=C2V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Parthians, Medes, 
Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, <A 
name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of 
Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, <A 
name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Cretans and Arabians: we hear them 
speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!" <A name=C2V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were all 
amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What does this mean?" <A 
name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Others, mocking, said, "They are filled 
with new wine." 
<P><A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, 
lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who 
dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words. <A 
name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For these aren't drunken, as you 
suppose, seeing it is only <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N1">the third hour of the 
day</A>. <A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this is what has been spoken 
through the prophet Joel: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>'It will be in the last days, says 
God,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I will pour out my Spirit on 
all flesh. 
<P>&nbsp;Your sons and your daughters will 
prophesy.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your young men will see 
visions.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your old men will dream dreams. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yes, and on my servants and on my 
handmaidens in those days,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour 
out my Spirit, and they will prophesy. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will show wonders in the sky 
above,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signs on the earth 
beneath;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood, and fire, and billows of 
smoke. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sun will be turned into 
darkness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon into 
blood,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the great and glorious day 
of the Lord comes.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=C2V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It will be, that 
whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.' 
<P><A name=C2V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus 
of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs 
which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know, <A 
name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>him, being delivered up by the 
determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of 
lawless men, crucified and killed; <A name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom God raised up, having freed him 
from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by 
it. <A name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For David says concerning him, 
<P>&nbsp;'I saw the Lord always before my 
face,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he is on my right hand, that I 
should not be moved. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore my heart was glad, and my 
tongue rejoiced.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover my flesh also 
will dwell in hope; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because you will not leave my soul in 
Hades,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither will you allow your Holy 
One to see decay. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You made known to me the ways of 
life.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will make me full of gladness 
with your presence.' 
<P><A name=C2V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Brothers, I may tell you freely of the 
patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to 
this day. <A name=C2V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing 
that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according 
to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, <A 
name=C2V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he 
foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his 
soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay. <A name=C2V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This Jesus God 
raised up, to which we all are witnesses. <A name=C2V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being therefore 
exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the 
promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear. 
<A name=C2V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For David didn't ascend into the 
heavens, but he says himself, 
<P>&nbsp;'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right 
hand,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=C2V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Until I make your 
enemies a footstool for your feet."' 
<P><A name=C2V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Let all the house of Israel therefore 
know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you 
crucified." 
<P><A name=C2V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they heard this, they were cut 
to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what 
shall we do?" 
<P><A name=C2V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter said to them, "Repent, and be 
baptized, everyone of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of 
sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <A name=C2V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For to you is the 
promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the 
Lord our God will call to himself." <A name=C2V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>With many other words he testified, and 
exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!" 
<P><A name=C2V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then those who gladly received his word 
were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls. <A

apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer. <A 
name=C2V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Fear came on every soul, and many 
wonders and signs were done through the apostles. <A name=C2V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All who believed 
were together, and had all things in common. <A name=C2V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They sold their 
possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had 
need. <A name=C2V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Day by day, continuing steadfastly with 
one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with 
gladness and singleness of heart, <A name=C2V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>praising God, and having favor with all 
the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being 
saved. 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter and John were going up into the 
temple at the hour of prayer, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N2">the ninth hour</A>. <A 
name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A 
certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they 
laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for 
the needy of those who entered into the temple. <A name=C3V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing Peter and 
John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy. <A 
name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with 
John, said, "Look at us." <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He listened to them, expecting to 
receive something from them. <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, "Silver and gold have I 
none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, 
get up and walk!" <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He took him by the right hand, and 
raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength. <A 
name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk. 
He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God. <A 
name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All 
the people saw him walking and praising God. <A name=C3V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They recognized 
him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the 
Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what 
had happened to him. <A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As the lame man who was healed held on 
to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is 
called Solomon's, greatly wondering. 
<P><A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Peter saw it, he responded to the 
people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten 
your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk? 
<A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, 
and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him. <A 
name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But you denied the Holy and Righteous 
One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, <A name=C3V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and killed the 
Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses. <A 
name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By 
faith in his name has his name made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, 
the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the 
presence of you all. 
<P><A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Now, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N3">brothers</A>, I know that you 
did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers. <A name=C3V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the things 
which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, 
he thus fulfilled. 
<P><A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Repent therefore, and turn again, that 
your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from 
the presence of the Lord, <A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and that he may send Christ Jesus, who 
was ordained for you before, <A name=C3V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom heaven must receive until the 
times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his 
holy prophets. <A name=C3V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Moses indeed said to the fathers, 
'The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. 
You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you. <A 
name=C3V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It 
will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly 
destroyed from among the people.' <A name=C3V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel 
and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these 
days. <A name=C3V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You are the children of the prophets, 
and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your 
seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.' <A name=C3V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God, having raised 
up his servant, Jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away 
everyone of you from your wickedness." 
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As they spoke to the people, the priests 
and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them, <A name=C4V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>being upset because 
they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
<A name=C4V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They laid hands on them, and put them in 
custody until the next day, for it was now evening. <A name=C4V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But many of those 
who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five 
thousand. 
<P><A name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened in the morning, that their 
rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem. <A 
name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Annas the high priest was there, with 
Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest. <A 
name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When 
they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in 
what name, have you done this?" 
<P><A name=C4V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, 
said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, <A 
name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>if 
we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what 
means this man has been healed, <A name=C4V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>be it known to you all, and to all the 
people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you 
crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before 
you whole. <A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is 'the stone which was regarded as 
worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.' <A 
name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There is salvation in none other, for 
neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which 
we must be saved!" 
<P><A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter 
and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they 
marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus. <A name=C4V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing the man who 
was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. <A 
name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when they had commanded them to go 
aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, <A name=C4V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "What shall 
we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, 
as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it. <A 
name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But so that this spreads no further 
among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to 
anyone in this name." <A name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They called them, and charged them not 
to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
<P><A name=C4V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter and John answered them, 
"Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, 
judge for yourselves, <A name=C4V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for we can't help telling the things 
which we saw and heard." 
<P><A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had further threatened them, 
they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for 
everyone glorified God for that which was done. <A name=C4V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the man on whom 
this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old. 
<P><A name=C4V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being let go, they came to their own 
company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to 
them. <A name=C4V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they heard it, they lifted up 
their voice to God with one accord, and said, "O Lord, you are God, who made the 
heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them; <A name=C4V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who by the mouth of 
your servant, David, said, 
<P>&nbsp;'Why do the nations rage,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
the peoples plot a vain thing? 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The kings of the earth take a 
stand,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rulers take council 
together,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Lord, and against 
his <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N4">Christ</A>.' 
<P><A name=C4V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For truly, in this city against your 
holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the 
Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together <A name=C4V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to do whatever your 
hand and your council foreordained to happen. <A name=C4V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now, Lord, look at 
their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness, 
<A name=C4V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while you stretch out your hand to 
heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy 
Servant Jesus." 
<P><A name=C4V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had prayed, the place was 
shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy 
Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. <A name=C4V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude of 
those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that 
anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things 
in common. <A name=C4V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>With great power, the apostles gave 
their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them 
all. <A name=C4V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For neither was there among them any 
who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought 
the proceeds of the things that were sold, <A name=C4V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and laid them at 
the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had 
need. <A name=C4V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed 
Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of 
Cyprus by race, <A name=C4V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having a field, sold it, and brought 
the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a certain man named Ananias, with 
Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession, <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and kept back part of the price, his 
wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the 
apostles' feet. <A name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan 
filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price 
of the land? <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While you kept it, didn't it remain your 
own? After it was sold, wasn't it in your power? How is it that you have 
conceived this thing in your heart? You haven't lied to men, but to God." 
<P><A name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ananias, hearing these words, fell down 
and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things. <A name=C5V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The young men arose 
and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him. <A name=C5V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>About three hours 
later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. <A name=C5V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter answered her, 
"Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." 
<P>She said, "Yes, for so much." 
<P><A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter asked her, "How is it that you 
have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those 
who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out." 
<P><A name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She fell down immediately at his feet, 
and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and 
buried her by her husband. <A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Great fear came on the whole assembly, 
and on all who heard these things. <A name=C5V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By the hands of the apostles many signs 
and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in 
Solomon's porch. <A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>None of the rest dared to join them, 
however the people honored them. <A name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>More believers were added to the Lord, 
multitudes of both men and women. <A name=C5V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They even carried out the sick into the 
streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the 
least his shadow might overshadow some of them. <A name=C5V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Multitudes also 
came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those 
who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed. 
<P><A name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the high priest rose up, and all 
those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were 
filled with jealousy, <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and laid hands on the apostles, and put 
them in public custody. <A name=C5V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But an angel of the Lord opened the 
prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said, <A name=C5V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Go stand and speak 
in the temple to the people all the words of this life." 
<P><A name=C5V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they heard this, they entered into 
the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who 
were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the 
children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. <A 
name=C5V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the officers who came didn't find 
them in the prison. They returned and reported, <A name=C5V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"We found the 
prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we 
opened them, we found no one inside!" 
<P><A name=C5V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the high priest, the captain 
of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed 
about them and what might become of this. <A name=C5V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One came and told 
them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and 
teaching the people." <A name=C5V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the captain went with the 
officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the 
people might stone them. 
<P><A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had brought them, they set 
them before the council. The high priest questioned them, <A name=C5V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "Didn't we 
strictly charge you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem 
with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us." 
<P><A name=C5V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter and the apostles answered, 
"We must obey God rather than men. <A name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, 
whom you killed, hanging him on a tree. <A name=C5V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God exalted him with his right hand to 
be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins. 
<A name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We are His witnesses of these things; 
and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him." 
<P><A name=C5V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they, when they heard this, were 
cut to the heart, and determined to kill them. <A name=C5V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But one stood up in 
the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the 
people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while. <A 
name=C5V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
said to them, "You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are 
about to do. <A name=C5V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For before these days Theudas rose up, 
making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, 
joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were 
dispersed, and came to nothing. <A name=C5V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After this man, Judas of Galilee rose 
up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also 
perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad. <A 
name=C5V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will 
be overthrown. <A name=C5V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if it is of God, you will not be 
able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!" 
<P><A name=C5V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and 
let them go. <A name=C5V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore departed from the 
presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer 
dishonor for Jesus' name. 
<P><A name=C5V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every day, in the temple and at home, 
they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ. 
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in those days, when the number of 
the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Grecian Jews against 
the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily service. <A 
name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The 
twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not appropriate 
for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. <A name=C6V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore select 
from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and 
of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. <A name=C6V4><FONT

steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word." 
<P><A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These words pleased the whole multitude. 
They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, 
Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch; <A 
name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom 
they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on 
them. <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The word of God increased and the number 
of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the 
priests were obedient to the faith. 
<P><A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Stephen, full of faith and power, 
performed great wonders and signs among the people. <A name=C6V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of those 
who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines," and of the Cyrenians, of the 
Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen. <A 
name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They weren't able to withstand the 
wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. <A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they secretly induced men to say, 
"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God." <A 
name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They stirred up the people, the elders, 
and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the 
council, <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and set up false witnesses who said, 
"This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the 
law. <A name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we have heard him say that this 
Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which 
Moses delivered to us." <A name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All who sat in the council, fastening 
their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel. 
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

so?" 
<P><A name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, 
before he lived in Haran, <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said to him, 'Get out of your land, 
and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.' <A 
name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then 
he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when 
his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living. <A 
name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He 
promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after 
him, when he still had no child. <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God spoke in this way: that his seed 
would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and 
mistreated for four hundred years. <A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>'I will judge the nation to which they 
will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me 
in this place.' <A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He gave him the covenant of 
circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the 
eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the 
twelve patriarchs. 
<P><A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"The patriarchs, moved with jealousy 
against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him, <A name=C7V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and delivered him 
out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king 
of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house. <A name=C7V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now a famine came 
over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found 
no food. <A name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time. <A name=C7V13><FONT

Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was revealed to 
Pharaoh. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his 
father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls. <A name=C7V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jacob went down 
into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers, <A name=C7V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they were 
brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in 
silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem. 
<P><A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"But as the time of the promise came 
close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
<A name=C7V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>until there arose a different king, who 
didn't know Joseph. <A name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same took advantage of our race, 
and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that 
they wouldn't stay alive. <A name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At that time Moses was born, and was 
exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father's house. <A

size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he was thrown out, Pharaoh's 
daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son. <A name=C7V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moses was 
instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and 
works. <A name=C7V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he was forty years old, it 
came into his heart to visit his <A

Israel. <A name=C7V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he 
defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian. <A 
name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them 
deliverance; but they didn't understand. 
<P><A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"The day following, he appeared to them 
as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are 
brothers. Why do you wrong one another?' <A name=C7V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he who did his neighbor wrong 
pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? <A

you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' <A name=C7V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moses fled at this 
saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father 
of two sons. 
<P><A name=C7V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame 
of fire in a bush. <A name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the 
sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him, <A

am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of 
Jacob.' Moses trembled, and dared not look. <A name=C7V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Lord said to 
him, 'Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy 
ground. <A name=C7V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to 
deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.' 
<P><A name=C7V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--God has sent him as both a ruler and a 
deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <A

wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty 
years. <A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our 
fathers, who received living oracles to give to us, <A name=C7V39><FONT

wouldn't be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to 
Egypt, <A name=C7V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

we don't know what has become of him.' <A name=C7V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

it according to the pattern that he had seen; <A name=C7V45><FONT

fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the

the days of David, <A name=C7V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. <A name=C7V47><FONT

him a house. <A name=C7V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C7V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one accord. <A name=C7V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They threw him out 
of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of 
a young man named Saul. <A name=C7V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

asleep. 
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. 
They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, 
except for the apostles. <A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison. <A

abroad went around preaching the word. <A name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and proclaimed to them the Christ. <A name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs 
which he did. <A name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been 
paralyzed and lame were healed. <A name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Samaria, making himself out to be some great one, <A name=C8V10><FONT

of God." <A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name 
of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <A name=C8V13><FONT

believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great 
miracles occuring, he was amazed. 
<P><A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and 
John to them, <A name=C8V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; <A name=C8V16><FONT

fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus. 
<A name=C8V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they received the Holy Spirit. <A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 
<A name=C8V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit." <A name=C8V20><FONT

him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the

this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be 
forgiven you. <A name=C8V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity." 
<P><A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to many villages of the Samaritans. <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from 
Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert." 
<P><A name=C8V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the

chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
<P><A name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, 
and join yourself to this chariot." 
<P><A name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Philip ran to him, and heard him 
reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?" 
<P><A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said, "How can I, unless someone 
explains it to me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit with him. <A 
name=C8V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the passage of the Scripture which 
he was reading was this, 
<P>&nbsp;"He was led as a sheep to the 
slaughter.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lamb before his shearer 
is silent,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he doesn't open his mouth. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the earth." 
<P><A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?" 
<P><A name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus. <A name=C8V36><FONT

way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What 
is keeping me from being baptized?"

commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, 
both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 
<P><A name=C8V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they came up out of the water, the 
Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see him any more, 
for he went on his way rejoicing. <A name=C8V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing 
through, he preached the Gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea. 
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul, still breathing threats and 
slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, <A

asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any 
who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to 
Jerusalem. <A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he traveled, it happened that he got 
close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him. <A

fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Saul, 
Saul, why do you persecute me?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one. <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Saul arose from the 
ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, 
and brought him into Damascus. <A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He was without sight for three days, and 
neither ate nor drank. 
<P><A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was a certain disciple at 
Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, <FONT

<P>He said, "Behold, it's me, Lord." 
<P><A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is 
praying, </FONT><A name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>and in a vision he 
has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he 
might receive his sight."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have 
heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at 
Jerusalem. <A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Here he has authority from the chief 
priests to bind all who call on your name." 
<P><A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Lord said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before 
the nations and kings, and the children of Israel. </FONT><A name=C9V16><FONT

<P><A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared 
to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your 
sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit." <A name=C9V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately 
something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose 
and was baptized. <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He took food and was strengthened. Saul 
stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus. <A name=C9V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately in the 
synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God. <A 
name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All who heard him were amazed, and 
said, "Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this 
name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief 
priests!" 
<P><A name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul increased more in strength, 
and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ. 
<A name=C9V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When many days were fulfilled, the Jews 
conspired together to kill him, <A name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but their plot became known to Saul. 
They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him, <A 
name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but his disciples took him by night, 
and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. <A name=C9V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Saul had come 
to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all 
afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. <A name=C9V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Barnabas took 
him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the 
Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had 
preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He was with them <A

<A name=C9V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>preaching boldly in the name of the 
Lord. He spoke and disputed against the Grecian Jews, but they were seeking to 
kill him. <A name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N11">brothers</A> knew it, they 
brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus. <A name=C9V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the assemblies 
throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They 
were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy 
Spirit. 
<P><A name=C9V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened, as Peter went throughout 
all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. <A 
name=C9V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There he found a certain man named 
Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed. <A 
name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus 
Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!" Immediately he arose. <A 
name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon 
saw him, and they turned to the Lord. 
<P><A name=C9V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was at Joppa a certain 
disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N12">Dorcas.</A> This woman was 
full of good works and acts of mercy which she did. <A name=C9V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened in 
those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed her, they laid her 
in an upper chamber. <A name=C9V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, 
hearing that Peter was there, sent <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N13">two men</A> to him, 
imploring him not to delay in coming to them. <A name=C9V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter got up and 
went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. All 
the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas 
had made while she was with them. <A name=C9V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter put them all out, and kneeled 
down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her 
eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. <A name=C9V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He gave her his 
hand, and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. 
<A name=C9V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it became known throughout all 
Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. <A name=C9V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened, that he stayed many days 
in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner. 
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was a certain man in 
Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian 
Regiment, <A name=C10V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>a devout man, and one who feared God 
with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and 
always prayed to God. <A name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At about <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N14">the ninth hour of the 
day</A>, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to 
him, "Cornelius!" 
<P><A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He, fastening his eyes on him, and 
being frightened, said, "What is it, Lord?" 
<P>He said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a 
memorial before God. <A name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, 
who is surnamed Peter. <A name=C10V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, 
whose house is by the seaside.<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP><A

<P><A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the angel who spoke to him had 
departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of 
those who waited on him continually. <A name=C10V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having explained everything to them, he 
sent them to Joppa. <A name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the next day as they were on 
their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray 
at about noon. <A name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He became hungry and desired to eat, 
but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance. <A name=C10V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saw heaven 
opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by 
four corners on the earth, <A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in which were all kinds of four-footed 
animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky. <A 
name=C10V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A voice came to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C10V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I 
have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." 
<P><A name=C10V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A voice came to him again the second 
time, <FONT color=#ff0000>"What God has cleansed, you must not call 
unclean."</FONT> <A name=C10V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This was done three times, and 
immediately the vessel was received up into heaven. <A name=C10V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now while Peter 
was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, 
behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's 
house, stood before the gate, <A name=C10V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and called and asked whether Simon, 
who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there. <A name=C10V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While Peter was 
pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N16">three</A> men seek you. <A 
name=C10V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But arise, get down, and go with them, 
doubting nothing; for I have sent them." 
<P><A name=C10V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter went down to the men, and said, 
"Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?" 
<P><A name=C10V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a 
righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the 
Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to 
what you say." <A name=C10V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he called them in and lodged them. 
On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers 
from Joppa accompanied him. <A name=C10V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the next day they entered into 
Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives 
and his near friends. <A name=C10V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When it happened that Peter entered, 
Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him. <A 
name=C10V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter raised him up, saying, 
"Stand up! I myself am also a man." <A name=C10V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he talked with him, he went in and 
found many gathered together. <A name=C10V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, "You yourselves know 
how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to 
one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any man unholy 
or unclean. <A name=C10V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore also I came without 
complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?" 
<P><A name=C10V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was 
fasting until this hour, and at <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N17">the ninth hour,</A> I prayed 
in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, <A 
name=C10V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is 
heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God. <A

size=-1><SUP>10:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Send therefore to Joppa, and summon 
Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the 
seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.' <A name=C10V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore I sent 
to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here 
present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by 
God." 
<P><A name=C10V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter opened his mouth and said, 
"Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism; <A name=C10V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but in every

which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the 
baptism which John preached; <A name=C10V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and 
healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. <A

both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they <A

on a tree. <A name=C10V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God raised him up the third day, and 
gave him to be revealed, <A name=C10V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he rose from the dead. <A name=C10V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of 
sins." 
<P><A name=C10V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While Peter was still speaking these 
words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word. <A 
name=C10V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They of the circumcision who believed 
were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was 
also poured out on the Gentiles. <A name=C10V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they heard them speaking in other 
languages and magnifying God. 
<P>Then Peter answered, <A name=C10V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Can any man forbid the water, that 
these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?" 
<A name=C10V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He commanded them to be baptized in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days. 
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the apostles and the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N19">brothers</A> who were in 
Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. <A 
name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, 
those who were of the circumcision contended with him, <A name=C11V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "You went 
in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!" 
<P><A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter began, and explained to them 
in order, saying, <A name=C11V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"I was in the city of Joppa praying, 
and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a 
great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me. <A 
name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I had looked intently at it, I 
considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping 
things, and birds of the sky. <A name=C11V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I also heard a voice saying to me, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'</FONT> <A name=C11V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I said, 'Not 
so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.' <A 
name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a voice answered me the second time 
out of heaven, <FONT color=#ff0000>'What God has cleansed, don't you call 
unclean.'</FONT> <A name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This was done three times, and all 
were drawn up again into heaven. <A name=C11V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, immediately three men stood 
before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me. <A 
name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Spirit told me to go with them, 
without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered 
into the man's house. <A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He told us how he had seen the angel 
standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose 
surname is Peter, <A name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who will speak to you words by which 
you will be saved, you and all your house.' <A name=C11V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As I began to 
speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. <A 
name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I remembered the word of the Lord, how 
he said, <FONT color=#ff0000>'John indeed baptized in water, but you will be 
baptized in the Holy Spirit.'</FONT> <A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If then God gave to them the same gift 
as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could 
withstand God?" 
<P><A name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they heard these things, they 
held their peace, and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the 
Gentiles repentance to life!" 
<P><A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore who were scattered 
abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, 
Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only. <A 
name=C11V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there were some of them, men of 
Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, 
preaching the Lord Jesus. <A name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The hand of the Lord was with them, 
and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. <A name=C11V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The report 
concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They 
sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch, <A name=C11V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, when he had 
come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with 
purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord. <A name=C11V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he was a good 
man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the 
Lord. 
<P><A name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look 
for Saul. <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had found him, he brought him 
to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with 
the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians 
in Antioch. 
<P><A name=C11V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in these days, prophets came down 
from Jerusalem to Antioch. <A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of them named Agabus stood up, and 
indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, 
which also happened in the days of Claudius. <A name=C11V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As any of the 
disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived 
in Judea; <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which they also did, sending it to the 
elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. 
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now about that time, Herod the king 
stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly. <A name=C12V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He killed James, 
the brother of John, with the sword. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he saw that it pleased the Jews, 
he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened bread. 
<A name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had arrested him, he put him in 
prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, 
intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover. <A name=C12V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter therefore was 
kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him. 
<A name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same night when Herod was about to 
bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. 
Guards in front of the door kept the prison. 
<P><A name=C12V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood 
by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him 
up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands. <A 
name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel said to him, "Get dressed and 
put on your sandals." He did so. He said to him, "Put on your cloak, and follow 
me." <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went out and followed him. He 
didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a 
vision. <A name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they were past the first and the 
second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened 
to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the 
angel departed from him. 
<P><A name=C12V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Peter had come to himself, he 
said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me 
out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting." 
<A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thinking about that, he came to the 
house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were 
gathered together and were praying. <A name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Peter knocked at the door of the 
gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. <A name=C12V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When she 
recognized Peter's voice, she didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and 
reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate. 
<P><A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said to her, "You are crazy!" But 
she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel." <A name=C12V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter 
continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed. <A 
name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he, beckoning to them with his 
hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the 
prison. He said, "Tell these things to James, and to the brothers." Then he 
departed, and went to another place. 
<P><A name=C12V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now as soon as it was day, there was 
no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter. <A 
name=C12V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Herod had sought for him, and 
didn't find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put 
to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there. <A 
name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Herod was very angry with the 
people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made 
Blastus, the king's chamberlain, their friend, they asked for peace, because 
their country depended on the king's country for food. <A name=C12V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On an appointed 
day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a 
speech to them. <A name=C12V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The people shouted, "The voice of a 
god, and not of a man!" <A name=C12V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately an angel of the Lord 
struck him, because he didn't give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and 
died. 
<P><A name=C12V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the word of God grew and 
multiplied. <A name=C12V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Barnabas and Saul returned <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N20">to</A> Jerusalem, when they 
had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark. 
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the assembly that was at Antioch 
there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, 
Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. <A 
name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and 
Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them." 
<P><A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then, when they had fasted and prayed 
and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. <A name=C13V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So, being sent out 
by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to 
Cyprus. <A name=C13V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they were at Salamis, they 
proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They had also John as 
their attendant. <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had gone through the island 
to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was 
Bar Jesus, <A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who was with the proconsul, Sergius 
Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought 
to hear the word of God. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his 
name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from 
the faith. <A name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul, who is also called Paul, 
filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him, <A name=C13V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, "Full of 
all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all 
righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? <A 
name=C13V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is 
on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!" 
<P>Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness. He went around seeking 
someone to lead him by the hand. <A name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the proconsul, when he saw what 
was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. 
<P><A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Paul and his company set sail from 
Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to 
Jerusalem. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they, passing on from Perga, came 
to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat 
down. <A name=C13V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After the reading of the law and the 
prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you 
have any word of exhortation for the people, speak." 
<P><A name=C13V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul stood up, and beckoning with his 
hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen. <A name=C13V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God of this 
people<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP><A

chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land 
of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it. <A name=C13V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For a period of 
about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <A name=C13V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had 
destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an 
inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years. <A name=C13V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things 
he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. <A name=C13V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Afterward they 
asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe 
of Benjamin, for forty years. <A name=C13V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had removed him, he raised up 
David to be their king, to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son 
of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.' <A name=C13V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From this man's 
seed, God has brought <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N22">salvation</A> to Israel 
according to his promise, <A name=C13V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>before his coming, when John had first 
preached the baptism of repentance <A

name=C13V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As John was fulfilling his course, he 
said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, one comes after 
me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.' <A name=C13V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brothers, children 
of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this 
salvation is sent out to you. <A name=C13V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and 
their rulers, because they didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which 
are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. <A name=C13V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Though they found 
no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed. <A 
name=C13V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had fulfilled all things 
that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a 
tomb. <A name=C13V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But God raised him from the dead, <A 
name=C13V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he was seen for many days by those 
who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the 
people. <A name=C13V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

made to the fathers, <A name=C13V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that God has fulfilled the same to us, 
their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second 
psalm, 
<P>&nbsp;'You are my Son.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I have 
become your father.' 
<P><A name=C13V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

you the holy and sure blessings of David.' <A name=C13V35><FONT

also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.' <A

fathers, and saw decay. <A name=C13V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

decay. <A name=C13V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>13:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when the Jews went out of the 
synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the 
next Sabbath. <A name=C13V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the synagogue broke up, many 
of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, 
speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. <A 
name=C13V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The next Sabbath almost the whole city 
was gathered together to hear the word of God. <A name=C13V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the Jews 
saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things 
which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed. 
<P><A name=C13V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, 
and said, "It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since 
indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, 
behold, we turn to the Gentiles. <A name=C13V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For so has the Lord commanded us, 
saying, 
<P>&nbsp;'I have set you as a light for the 
Gentiles,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you should bring salvation 
to the uttermost parts of the earth.'" 
<P><A name=C13V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As the Gentiles heard this, they were 
glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life 
believed. <A name=C13V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Lord's word was spread abroad 
throughout all the region. <A name=C13V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Jews stirred up the devout and 
prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution 
against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders. <A 
name=C13V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they shook off the dust of their 
feet against them, and came to Iconium. <A name=C13V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples were filled with joy 
with the Holy Spirit. 
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened in Iconium that they 
entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great 
multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. <A name=C14V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N25">disbelieving</A> Jews 
stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers. <A 
name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore they stayed there a long 
time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, 
granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <A name=C14V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the multitude 
of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
<A name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When some of both the Gentiles and the 
Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them, <A 
name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they became aware of it, and fled to 
the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region. <A 
name=C14V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There they preached the Gospel. 
<P><A name=C14V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent 
in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked. <A 
name=C14V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he 
had faith to be made whole, <A name=C14V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>said with a loud voice, "Stand upright 
on your feet!" He leaped up and walked. <A name=C14V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the multitude saw what Paul had 
done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods 
have come down to us in the likeness of men!" <A name=C14V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They called 
Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he was the chief speaker. <A 
name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The priest of Jupiter, whose temple 
was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would 
have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes. <A name=C14V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the 
apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang 
into the multitude, crying out, <A name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Men, why are you doing these things? 
We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you 
should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the 
earth and the sea, and all that is in them; <A name=C14V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who in the 
generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. <A 
name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yet he didn't leave himself without 
witness, in that he did good and gave <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N26">you</A> rains from the sky 
and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness." 
<P><A name=C14V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even saying these things, they hardly 
stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them. <A name=C14V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some Jews from 
Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned 
Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. 
<P><A name=C14V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as the disciples stood around him, 
he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas 
to Derbe. <A name=C14V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had preached the Gospel to 
that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and 
Antioch, <A name=C14V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>confirming the souls of the disciples, 
exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we 
must enter into the Kingdom of God. <A name=C14V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had appointed elders for 
them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the 
Lord, on whom they had believed. 
<P><A name=C14V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They passed through Pisidia, and came 
to Pamphylia. <A name=C14V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had spoken the word in 
Perga, they went down to Attalia. <A name=C14V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From there they sailed to Antioch, 
from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they 
had fulfilled. <A name=C14V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had arrived, and had 
gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done 
with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. <A 
name=C14V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They stayed there with the disciples 
for a long time. 
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some men came down from Judea and 
taught the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you 
can't be saved." <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no 
small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and 
some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this 
question. <A name=C15V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They, being sent on their way by the 
assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of 
the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N27">brothers.</A> <A 
name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had come to Jerusalem, they 
were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported 
all things that God had done with them. 
<P><A name=C15V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of the sect of the Pharisees 
who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge 
them to keep the law of Moses." 
<P><A name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The apostles and the elders were 
gathered together to see about this matter. <A name=C15V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When there had been 
much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good 
while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear 
the word of the Gospel, and believe. <A name=C15V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God, who knows the heart, testified 
about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us. <A 
name=C15V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. <A 
name=C15V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now therefore why do you tempt God, 
that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our 
fathers nor we were able to bear? <A name=C15V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we believe that we are saved 
through the grace of the Lord Jesus,<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP><A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N28">*</A></SUP></FONT></FONT> 
just as they are." 
<P><A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All the multitude kept silence, and 
they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done 
among the Gentiles through them. <A name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After they were silent, James 
answered, "Brothers, listen to me. <A name=C15V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simeon has reported how God first 
visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. <A 
name=C15V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This agrees with the words of the 
prophets. As it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>'After these things I will 
return.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will again build the tent of 
David, which has fallen.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will again 
build its ruins. 
<P>&nbsp;I will set it up,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A

size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That the rest of men may seek after 
the Lord;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Gentiles who are called 
by my name, 
<P>&nbsp;Says the Lord, who does all these 
things.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=C15V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All his works are 
known to God from eternity.' 
<P><A name=C15V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Therefore my judgment is that we 
don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God, <A 
name=C15V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but that we write to them that they 
abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is 
strangled, and from blood. <A name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Moses from generations of old has 
in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath." 

<P><A name=C15V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then it seemed good to the apostles 
and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and 
send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, 
chief men among the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N29">brothers.</A> <A 
name=C15V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They wrote these things by their hand: 

<P>"The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the 
Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings. <A name=C15V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because we have 
heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling 
your souls, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave 
no commandment; <A name=C15V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>it seemed good to us, having come to 
one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and 
Paul, <A name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>men who have risked their lives for 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <A name=C15V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We have sent therefore Judas and 
Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth. <A 
name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, 
and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things: <A 
name=C15V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that you abstain from things 
sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual 
immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. 
Farewell." 
<P><A name=C15V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So, when they were sent off, they came 
to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter. 
<A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had read it, they rejoiced 
over the encouragement. <A name=C15V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Judas and Silas, also being prophets 
themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them. <A 
name=C15V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After they had spent some time there, 
they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles. <A 
name=C15V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP><A

name=C15V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul and Barnabas stayed in 
Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 
<P><A name=C15V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After some days Paul said to Barnabas, 
"Let's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed 
the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing." <A name=C15V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Barnabas planned 
to take John, who was called Mark, with them also. <A name=C15V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul didn't 
think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from 
them in Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to do the work. <A name=C15V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the 
contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark 
with him, and sailed away to Cyprus, <A name=C15V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Paul chose Silas, and went out, 
being commended by the brothers to the grace of God. <A name=C15V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He went through 
Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies. 
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He came to Derbe and Lystra: and 
behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who 
believed; but his father was a Greek. <A name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The brothers who were at Lystra and 
Iconium gave a good testimony about him. <A name=C16V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul wanted to have him go out with 
him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those 
parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <A name=C16V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As they went on 
their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which 
had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. <A 
name=C16V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So 
the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily. 
<P><A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had gone through the region 
of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word 
in Asia. <A name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had come opposite Mysia, they 
tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn't allow them. <A name=C16V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Passing by Mysia, 
they came down to Troas. <A name=C16V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A vision appeared to Paul in the night. 
There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over into 
Macedonia and help us." <A name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had seen the vision, 
immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had 
called us to preach the Gospel to them. <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Setting sail therefore from Troas, we 
made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; <A 
name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and from there to Philippi, which is a 
city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying 
some days in this city. 
<P><A name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the Sabbath day we went forth 
outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of 
prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together. <A 
name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A certain woman named Lydia, a seller 
of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart 
the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul. <A 
name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When she and her household were 
baptized, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the 
Lord, come into my house, and stay." So she persuaded us. 
<P><A name=C16V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened, as we were going to 
prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought 
her masters much gain by fortune telling. <A name=C16V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Following Paul and 
us, she cried out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to 
us the way of salvation!" <A name=C16V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She was doing this for many days. 
<P>But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I charge 
you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" It came out that very hour. 
<A name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when her masters saw that the hope 
of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the 
marketplace before the rulers. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had brought them to the 
magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city, <A 
name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and set forth customs which it is not 
lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans." 
<P><A name=C16V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude rose up together against 
them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to 
be beaten with rods. <A name=C16V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had laid many stripes on 
them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely, <A 
name=C16V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, having received such a charge, 
threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks. 
<P><A name=C16V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But about midnight Paul and Silas were 
praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. <A 
name=C16V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, 
so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors 
were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened. <A name=C16V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The jailer, being 
roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was 
about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. <A 
name=C16V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul cried with a loud voice, 
saying, "Don't harm yourself, for we are all here!" 
<P><A name=C16V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He called for lights and sprang in, 
and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas, <A name=C16V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and brought them 
out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" 
<P><A name=C16V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household." <A name=C16V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They spoke the 
word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house. 
<P><A name=C16V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He took them the same hour of the 
night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his 
household. <A name=C16V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He brought them up into his house, and 
set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having 
believed in God. 
<P><A name=C16V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when it was day, the magistrates 
sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go." 
<P><A name=C16V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The jailer reported these words to 
Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, 
and go in peace." 
<P><A name=C16V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul said to them, "They have 
beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into 
prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most assuredly, but let them come 
themselves and bring us out!" 
<P><A name=C16V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sergeants reported these words to 
the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans, <A 
name=C16V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they came and begged them. When 
they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city. <A 
name=C16V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They went out of the prison, and 
entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged 
them, and departed. 
<P><A name=C17V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they had passed through 
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue 
of the Jews. <A name=C17V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul, as was his custom, went in to 
them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <A 
name=C17V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>explaining and demonstrating that the 
Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom 
I proclaim to you, is the Christ." 
<P><A name=C17V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some of them were persuaded, and joined 
Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the 
chief women. <A name=C17V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N31">But the unpersuaded Jews 
took along</A> some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set 
the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them 
out to the people. <A name=C17V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they didn't find them, they 
dragged Jason and certain <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N32">brothers</A> before the 
rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have 
come here also, <A name=C17V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom Jason has received. These all act 
contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!" <A 
name=C17V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude and the rulers of the 
city were troubled when they heard these things. <A name=C17V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had taken 
security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. <A name=C17V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The brothers 
immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they 
went into the Jewish synagogue. 
<P><A name=C17V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now these were more noble than those 
in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, 
examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. <A 
name=C17V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many of them therefore believed; also 
of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men. <A name=C17V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the Jews 
of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at 
Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes. <A 
name=C17V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the brothers immediately sent out 
Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there. <A 
name=C17V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But those who escorted Paul brought 
him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they 
should come to him very quickly, they departed. 
<P><A name=C17V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now while Paul waited for them at 
Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols. <A 
name=C17V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he reasoned in the synagogue with 
the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who 
met him. <A name=C17V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic 
philosophers <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N33">also</A> 
were conversing with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" 
<P>Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign deities," because he preached 
Jesus and the resurrection. 
<P><A name=C17V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They took hold of him, and brought him 
to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is 
spoken by you? <A name=C17V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you bring certain strange things 
to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean." <A 
name=C17V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now all the Athenians and the 
strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or 
to hear some new thing. 
<P><A name=C17V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul stood in the middle of the 
Areopagus, and said, "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious 
in all things. <A name=C17V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as I passed along, and observed 
the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN 
UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you. 
<A name=C17V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God who made the world and all 
things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made 
with hands, <A name=C17V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>neither is he served by men's hands, 
as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, 
and all things. <A name=C17V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He made from one blood every nation of 
men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed 
seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings, <A name=C17V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that they should 
seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he 
is not far from each one of us. <A name=C17V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>'For in him we live, and move, and 
have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his 
offspring.' <A name=C17V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being then the offspring of God, we 
ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, 
engraved by art and design of man. <A name=C17V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The times of ignorance therefore God 
overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, <A 
name=C17V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because he has appointed a day in 
which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; 
of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the 
dead." 
<P><A name=C17V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they heard of the 
resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you 
again concerning this." 
<P><A name=C17V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thus Paul went out from among them. <A 
name=C17V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But certain men joined with him, and 
believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named 
Damaris, and others with them. 
<P><A name=C18V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things Paul departed from 
Athens, and came to Corinth. <A name=C18V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a 
man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife 
Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He 
came to them, <A name=C18V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and because he practiced the same 
trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers. <A 
name=C18V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. <A 
name=C18V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Silas and Timothy came down 
from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that 
Jesus was the Christ. <A name=C18V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they opposed him and blasphemed, 
he shook out his clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I 
am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!" 
<P><A name=C18V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He departed there, and went into the 
house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next 
door to the synagogue. <A name=C18V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, 
believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they 
heard, believed and were baptized. <A name=C18V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a 
vision, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Don't be afraid, but speak and don't be silent; 
</FONT><A name=C18V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>for I am with you, 
and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this 
city."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C18V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He lived there a year and six months, 
teaching the word of God among them. <A name=C18V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Gallio was proconsul of 
Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the 
judgment seat, <A name=C18V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "This man persuades men to 
worship God contrary to the law." 
<P><A name=C18V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul was about to open his 
mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of 
wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you; <A 
name=C18V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but if they are questions about words 
and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don't want to be a 
judge of these matters." <A name=C18V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He drove them from the judgment seat. 
<P><A name=C18V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then all the Greeks laid hold on 
Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. 
Gallio didn't care about any of these things. 
<P><A name=C18V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul, having stayed after this many 
more days, took his leave of the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N34">brothers,</A> and sailed 
from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in 
Cenchreae, for he had a vow. <A name=C18V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He came to Ephesus, and he left them 
there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. <A 
name=C18V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they asked him to stay with them 
a longer time, he declined; <A name=C18V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but taking his leave of them, and 
saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will 
return again to you if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus. 
<P><A name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had landed at Caesarea, he 
went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch. <A name=C18V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having spent some 
time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in 
order, establishing all the disciples. <A name=C18V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an 
Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the 
Scriptures. <A name=C18V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This man had been instructed in the 
way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the 
things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John. <A 
name=C18V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He began to speak boldly in the 
synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and 
explained to him the way of God more accurately. 
<P><A name=C18V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had determined to pass over 
into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive 
him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace; 
<A name=C18V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he powerfully refuted the Jews, 
publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. 
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened that, while Apollos was at 
Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and 
found certain disciples. <A name=C19V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, "Did you receive the 
Holy Spirit when you believed?" 
<P>They said to him, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." 
<P><A name=C19V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said, "Into what then were you 
baptized?" 
<P>They said, "Into John's baptism." 
<P><A name=C19V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul said, "John indeed baptized with 
the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the 
one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus." 
<P><A name=C19V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they heard this, they were 
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <A name=C19V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Paul had laid his hands on them, 
the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and 
prophesied. <A name=C19V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were about twelve men in all. <A 
name=C19V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, 
reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God. 
<P><A name=C19V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when some were hardened and 
disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from 
them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. <A 
name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This continued for two years, so that 
all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and 
Greeks. 
<P><A name=C19V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God worked special miracles by the 
hands of Paul, <A name=C19V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons 
were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out. <A 
name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of the itinerant Jews, 
exorcists, took on themselves to name over those who had the evil spirits the 
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches." <A 
name=C19V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There were seven sons of one Sceva, a 
Jewish chief priest, who did this. 
<P><A name=C19V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I 
know, and Paul I know, but who are you?" <A name=C19V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The man in whom 
the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against 
them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <A 
name=C19V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This became known to all, both Jews 
and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the 
Lord Jesus was magnified. <A name=C19V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many also of those who had believed 
came, confessing, and declaring their deeds. <A name=C19V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many of those who 
practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight 
of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N35">fifty thousand pieces of 
silver.</A> <A name=C19V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the word of the Lord was growing 
and becoming mighty. 
<P><A name=C19V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after these things had ended, Paul 
determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go 
to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome." 
<P><A name=C19V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having sent into Macedonia two of 
those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for 
a while. <A name=C19V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>About that time there arose no small 
stir concerning the Way. <A name=C19V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For a certain man named Demetrius, a 
silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to 
the craftsmen, <A name=C19V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom he gathered together, with the 
workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we 
have our wealth. <A name=C19V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You see and hear, that not at Ephesus 
alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away 
many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands. <A 
name=C19V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not only is there danger that this our 
trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis 
will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the 
world worships." 
<P><A name=C19V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they heard this they were filled 
with anger, and cried out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" <A 
name=C19V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The whole city was filled with 
confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius 
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel. <A 
name=C19V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Paul wanted to enter in to the 
people, the disciples didn't allow him. <A name=C19V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Certain also of the Asiarchs, being 
his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater. <A 
name=C19V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some therefore cried one thing, and 
some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know why 
they had come together. <A name=C19V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They brought Alexander out of the 
multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and 
would have made a defense to the people. <A name=C19V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when they 
perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours 
cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" 
<P><A name=C19V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the town clerk had quieted the 
multitude, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that 
the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of 
the image which fell down from Zeus? <A name=C19V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing then that these things can't be 
denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash. <A name=C19V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you have 
brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of 
your goddess. <A name=C19V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore Demetrius and the 
craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, 
and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another. <A 
name=C19V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if you seek anything about other 
matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly. <A name=C19V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For indeed we are 
in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause. 
Concerning it, we wouldn't be able to give an account of this commotion." <A 
name=C19V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had thus spoken, he dismissed 
the assembly. 
<P><A name=C20V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent 
for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia. <A 
name=C20V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had gone through those parts, 
and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece. <A 
name=C20V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had spent three months there, 
and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, 
he determined to return through Macedonia. <A name=C20V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These accompanied 
him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the 
Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia. <A 
name=C20V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But these had gone ahead, and were 
waiting for us at Troas. <A name=C20V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We sailed away from Philippi after the 
days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we 
stayed seven days. 
<P><A name=C20V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the first day of the week, when the 
disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, 
intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight. <A 
name=C20V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There were many lights in the upper 
chamber where <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N36">we</A> were 
gathered together. <A name=C20V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A certain young man named Eutychus sat 
in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke still longer, being 
weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up 
dead. <A name=C20V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul went down, and fell upon him, and 
embracing him said, "Don't be troubled, for his life is in him." 
<P><A name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had gone up, and had broken 
bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of 
day, he departed. <A name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They brought the boy in alive, and 
were greatly comforted. 
<P><A name=C20V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we who went ahead to the ship set 
sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, 
intending himself to go by land. <A name=C20V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he met us at Assos, we took him 
aboard, and came to Mitylene. <A name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Sailing from there, we came the 
following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at 
Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus. <A name=C20V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Paul had 
determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; 
for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day 
of Pentecost. 
<P><A name=C20V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and 
called to himself the elders of the assembly. <A name=C20V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had come 
to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set 
foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, <A name=C20V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>serving the Lord 
with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the 
plots of the Jews; <A name=C20V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how I didn't shrink from declaring to 
you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house, 
<A name=C20V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks 
repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there; <A name=C20V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>except that the 
Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for 
me. <A name=C20V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But these things don't count; nor do I 
hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the 
ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Gospel of 
the grace of God. 
<P><A name=C20V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now, behold, I know that you all, 
among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more. 
<A name=C20V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore I testify to you this day 
that I am clean from the blood of all men, <A name=C20V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I didn't 
shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. <A name=C20V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take heed, 
therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has 
made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N38">the Lord and</A> God which 
he purchased with his own blood. <A name=C20V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I know that after my departure, 
vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. <A 
name=C20V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Men will arise from among your own 
selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. <A 
name=C20V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore watch, remembering that for 
a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with 
tears. <A name=C20V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N39">brothers,</A> I entrust you 
to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you 
the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. <A name=C20V33><FONT

silver, or gold, or clothing. <A name=C20V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me. <A 
name=C20V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In all things I gave you an example, 
that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the 
Lord Jesus, that he himself said, <FONT color=#ff0000>'It is more blessed to 
give than to receive.'</FONT>" 
<P><A name=C20V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had spoken these things, he 
knelt down and prayed with them all. <A name=C20V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They all wept a lot, and fell on 
Paul's neck and kissed him, <A name=C20V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>sorrowing most of all because of the 
word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they 
accompanied him to the ship. 
<P><A name=C21V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When it happened that we had parted 
from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next 
day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. <A name=C21V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having found a ship crossing over to 
Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. <A name=C21V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had come in sight of Cyprus, 
leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there 
the ship was to unload her cargo. <A name=C21V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having found disciples, we stayed there 
seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to 
Jerusalem. <A name=C21V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When it happened that we had 
accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives 
and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down 
on the beach, we prayed. <A name=C21V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After saying goodbye to each other, we 
went on board the ship, and they returned home again. 
<P><A name=C21V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had finished the voyage from 
Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one 
day. <A name=C21V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the next day, we, who were Paul's 
companions, departed, and came to Caesarea. 
<P>We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, 
and stayed with him. <A name=C21V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this man had four virgin daughters 
who prophesied. <A name=C21V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As we stayed there some days, a 
certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <A name=C21V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Coming to us, and 
taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the 
Holy Spirit: 'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and 
will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'" 
<P><A name=C21V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we heard these things, both we 
and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. <A 
name=C21V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Paul answered, "What are you 
doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but 
also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." 
<P><A name=C21V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he would not be persuaded, we 
ceased, saying, "The Lord's will be done." 
<P><A name=C21V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these days we took up our 
baggage and went up to Jerusalem. <A name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some of the disciples from Caesarea 
also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom 
we would stay. 
<P><A name=C21V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had come to Jerusalem, the 
brothers received us gladly. <A name=C21V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The day following, Paul went in with 
us to James; and all the elders were present. <A name=C21V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had 
greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the 
Gentiles through his ministry. <A name=C21V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They, when they heard it, glorified 
God. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the 
Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law. <A

size=-1><SUP>21:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They have been informed about you, 
that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling 
them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs. <A 
name=C21V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What then? The assembly must certainly 
meet, for they will hear that you have come. <A name=C21V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore do what 
we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow. <A name=C21V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take them, and 
purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave 
their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they 
have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law. 
<A name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But concerning the Gentiles who 
believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, 
except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, 
from strangled things, and from sexual immorality." 
<P><A name=C21V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Paul took the men, and the next 
day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the 
fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for 
every one of them. <A name=C21V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the seven days were almost 
completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all 
the multitude and laid hands on him, <A name=C21V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This 
is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and 
this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled 
this holy place!" <A name=C21V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they had seen Trophimus, the 
Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into 
the temple. 
<P><A name=C21V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All the city was moved, and the people 
ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately 
the doors were shut. <A name=C21V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As they were trying to kill him, news 
came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an 
uproar. <A name=C21V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately he took soldiers and 
centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the 
soldiers, stopped beating Paul. <A name=C21V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the commanding officer came near, 
arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was 
and what he had done. <A name=C21V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some shouted one thing, and some 
another, among the crowd. When he couldn't find out the truth because of the 
noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks. 
<P><A name=C21V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he came to the stairs, it 
happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the 
crowd; <A name=C21V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for the multitude of the people 
followed after, crying out, "Away with him!" <A name=C21V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As Paul was about 
to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak 
to you?" 
<P>He said, "Do you know Greek? <A name=C21V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Aren't you then the Egyptian, who 
before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the 
four thousand men of the Assassins?" 
<P><A name=C21V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from 
Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to 
speak to the people." 
<P><A name=C21V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had given him permission, 
Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there 
was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying, 
<P><A name=C22V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Brothers and fathers, listen to the

<P><A name=C22V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they heard that he spoke to them 
in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said, <A name=C22V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"I am indeed a Jew, 
born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, 
instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being 
zealous for God, even as you all are this day. <A name=C22V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I persecuted this 
Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. <A 
name=C22V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I 
received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also 
who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished. <A name=C22V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened that, 
as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there 
shone from the sky a great light around me. <A name=C22V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I fell to the 
ground, and heard a voice saying to me, <FONT color=#ff0000>'Saul, Saul, why are 
you persecuting me?'</FONT> <A name=C22V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He 
said to me, <FONT color=#ff0000>'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you 
persecute.'</FONT> 
<P><A name=C22V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Those who were with me indeed saw the 
light and were afraid, but they didn't understand the voice of him who spoke to 
me. <A name=C22V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The 
Lord said to me, <FONT color=#ff0000>'Arise, and go into Damascus. There you 
will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'</FONT> <A 
name=C22V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I couldn't see for the glory of 
that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into 
Damascus. <A name=C22V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One Ananias, a devout man according to 
the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus, <A 
name=C22V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>came to me, and standing by me said to 
me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at him. <A 
name=C22V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said, 'The God of our fathers has 
appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a 
voice from his mouth. <A name=C22V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you will be a witness for him to 
all men of what you have seen and heard. <A name=C22V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now why do you 
wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the 
Lord.' 
<P><A name=C22V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"It happened that, when I had returned 
to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance, <A 
name=C22V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saw him saying to me, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not 
receive testimony concerning me from you.'</FONT> <A name=C22V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I said, 'Lord, 
they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who 
believed in you. <A name=C22V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the blood of Stephen, your

guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.' 
<P><A name=C22V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Gentiles.'</FONT>" 
<P><A name=C22V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They listened to him until he said 
that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, 
for he isn't fit to live!" 
<P><A name=C22V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As they cried out, and threw off their 
cloaks, and threw dust into the air, <A name=C22V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the commanding officer commanded him 
to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that 
he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that. <A 
name=C22V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had tied him up with thongs, 
Paul asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man 
who is a Roman, and not found guilty?" 
<P><A name=C22V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the centurion heard it, he went 
to the commanding officer and told him, "Watch what you are about to do, for 
this man is a Roman!" 
<P><A name=C22V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The commanding officer came and asked 
him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" 
<P>He said, "Yes." 
<P><A name=C22V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The commanding officer answered, "I 
bought my citizenship for a great price." 
<P>Paul said, "But I was born a Roman." 
<P><A name=C22V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately those who were about to 
examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when 
he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him. <A name=C22V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But on the next 
day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed 
him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come 
together, and brought Paul down and set him before them. 
<P><A name=C23V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul, looking steadfastly at the 
council, said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until 
this day." 
<P><A name=C23V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The high priest, Ananias, commanded 
those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 
<P><A name=C23V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Paul said to him, "God will strike 
you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and 
command me to be struck contrary to the law?" 
<P><A name=C23V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Those who stood by said, "Do you malign 
God's high priest?" 
<P><A name=C23V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul said, "I didn't know, brothers, 
that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler 
of your people.'" <A name=C23V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul perceived that the one 
part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men 
and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and 
resurrection of the dead I am being judged!" 
<P><A name=C23V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said this, an argument 
arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. <A 
name=C23V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Sadducees say that there is no 
resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these. <A 
name=C23V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A 
great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and 
contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has 
spoken to him, let's not fight against God!" 
<P><A name=C23V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When a great argument arose, the 
commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded 
the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him 
into the barracks. 
<P><A name=C23V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The following night, the Lord stood by 
him, and said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified 
about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C23V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When it was day, some of the Jews 
banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would 
neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. <A name=C23V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There were more 
than forty people who had made this conspiracy. <A name=C23V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They came to the 
chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great 
curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. <A name=C23V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now therefore, you 
with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to 
you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are 
ready to kill him before he comes near." 
<P><A name=C23V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul's sister's son heard of their 
lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul. <A 
name=C23V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul summoned one of the centurions, 
and said, "Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something 
to tell him." 
<P><A name=C23V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he took him, and brought him to the 
commanding officer, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to 
bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you." 
<P><A name=C23V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The commanding officer took him by the 
hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell 
me?" 
<P><A name=C23V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask 
you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire 
somewhat more accurately concerning him. <A name=C23V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore don't 
yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound 
themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. 
Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you." 
<P><A name=C23V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the commanding officer let the 
young man go, charging him, "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to 
me." <A name=C23V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He called to himself two of the 
centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, 
with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N40">the third hour of the 
night</A>." <A name=C23V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He asked them to provide animals, that 
they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor. <A 
name=C23V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He wrote a letter like this: 
<P><A name=C23V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent 
governor Felix: Greetings. 
<P><A name=C23V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"This man was seized by the Jews, and 
was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, 
having learned that he was a Roman. <A name=C23V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Desiring to know the cause why they 
accused him, I brought him down to their council. <A name=C23V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I found him to be 
accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge 
worthy of death or of bonds. <A name=C23V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I was told that the Jews lay in 
wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to 
bring their accusations against him before you. Farewell." 
<P><A name=C23V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the soldiers, carrying out their 
orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. <A name=C23V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But on the next 
day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks. <A 
name=C23V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they came to Caesarea and 
delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. <A 
name=C23V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the governor had read it, he 
asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he 
said, <A name=C23V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"I will hear you fully when your 
accusers also arrive." He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace. 
<P><A name=C24V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After five days, the high priest, 
Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They 
informed the governor against Paul. <A name=C24V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he was called, Tertullus began to 
accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent 
measures are coming to this nation, <A name=C24V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>we accept it in all ways and in all 
places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. <A name=C24V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But, that I don't 
delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words. <A 
name=C24V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we have found this man to be a 
plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, 
and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. <A name=C24V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He even tried to 
profane the temple, and we arrested him.<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP><A

examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse 
him." 
<P><A name=C24V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews also joined in the attack, 
affirming that these things were so. <A name=C24V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the governor had beckoned to him 
to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this 
nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense, <A name=C24V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>seeing that you 
can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at 
Jerusalem. <A name=C24V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the temple they didn't find me 
disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in 
the city. <A name=C24V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nor can they prove to you the things 
of which they now accuse me. <A name=C24V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this I confess to you, that after 
the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing 
all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the 
prophets; <A name=C24V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having hope toward God, which these 
also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of 
the just and unjust. <A name=C24V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Herein I also practice always having a 
conscience void of offense toward God and men. <A name=C24V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after some 
years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings; <A 
name=C24V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>amid which certain Jews from Asia 
found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil. <A 
name=C24V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They ought to have been here before 
you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me. <A 
name=C24V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or else let these men themselves say 
what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council, <A 
name=C24V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>unless it is for this one thing that I 
cried standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being 
judged before you today!'" 
<P><A name=C24V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Felix, having more exact knowledge 
concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, 
comes down, I will decide your case." <A name=C24V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He ordered the centurion that Paul 
should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid 
any of his friends to serve him or to visit him. <A name=C24V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But after some 
days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, 
and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. <A name=C24V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he reasoned 
about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was 
terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient 
for me, I will summon you." <A name=C24V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money 
would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent 
for him more often, and talked with him. <A name=C24V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when two years 
were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain 
favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds. 
<P><A name=C25V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Festus therefore, having come into the 
province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. <A 
name=C25V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the high priest and the principal 
men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him, <A 
name=C25V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>asking a favor against him, that he 
would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way. <A 
name=C25V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However Festus answered that Paul 
should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart 
shortly. <A name=C25V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Let them therefore," said he, "that 
are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the 
man, let them accuse him." 
<P><A name=C25V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had stayed among them more than 
ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment 
seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. <A name=C25V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had come, the Jews who had come 
down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous 
charges which they could not prove, <A name=C25V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while he said in his defense, "Neither 
against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I 
sinned at all." 
<P><A name=C25V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Festus, desiring to gain favor with 
the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be 
judged by me there concerning these things?" 
<P><A name=C25V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul said, "I am standing before 
Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the 
Jews, as you also know very well. <A name=C25V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if I have done wrong, and have 
committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those 
things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal 
to Caesar!" 
<P><A name=C25V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Festus, when he had conferred 
with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall 
go." 
<P><A name=C25V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa 
the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus. <A 
name=C25V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he stayed there many days, Festus 
laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a 
prisoner by Felix; <A name=C25V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, 
the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence 
against him. <A name=C25V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To whom I answered that it is not the 
custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has 
met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense 
concerning the matter laid against him. <A name=C25V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore they had come together 
here, I didn't delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and 
commanded the man to be brought. <A name=C25V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Concerning whom, when the accusers 
stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed; <A 
name=C25V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but had certain questions against him 
about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed 
to be alive. <A name=C25V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being perplexed how to inquire 
concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and 
there be judged concerning these matters. <A name=C25V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>25:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul had 
appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept 
until I could send him to Caesar." 
<P><A name=C25V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would 
like to hear the man myself." 
<P>"Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him." 
<P><A name=C25V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So on the next day, when Agrippa and 
Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing 
with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of 
Festus, Paul was brought in. <A name=C25V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all 
men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude 
of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not 
to live any longer. <A name=C25V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when I found that he had committed 
nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined 
to send him. <A name=C25V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Of whom I have no certain thing to 
write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially 
before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to 
write. <A name=C25V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it seems to me unreasonable, in 
sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him." 
<P><A name=C26V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak 
for yourself." 
<P>Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense. <A name=C26V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"I think myself 
happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning 
all the things that I am accused by the Jews, <A name=C26V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>especially because 
you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore 
I beg you to hear me patiently. 
<P><A name=C26V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Indeed, all the Jews know my way of 
life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at 
Jerusalem; <A name=C26V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having known me from the first, if they 
are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a 
Pharisee. <A name=C26V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I stand here to be judged for the 
hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, <A name=C26V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which our twelve 
tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I 
am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa! <A name=C26V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why is it judged incredible with you, 
if God does raise the dead? 
<P><A name=C26V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"I myself most assuredly thought that I 
ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <A 
name=C26V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This I also did in Jerusalem. I both 
shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief 
priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them. <A 
name=C26V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Punishing them often in all the 
synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against 
them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. 
<P><A name=C26V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus 
with the authority and commission from the chief priests, <A name=C26V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>at noon, O King, I 
saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me 
and those who traveled with me. <A name=C26V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had all fallen to the earth, I 
heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, <FONT color=#ff0000>'Saul, 
Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the 
goads.'</FONT> 
<P><A name=C26V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' 
<P>"He said, <FONT color=#ff0000>'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 
</FONT><A name=C26V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you 
a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the 
things which I will reveal to you; </FONT><A name=C26V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT 
color=#ff0000>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I 
send you, </FONT><A name=C26V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to 
God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who 
are sanctified by faith in me.'</FONT> 
<P><A name=C26V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not 
disobedient to the heavenly vision, <A name=C26V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but declared first to them of 
Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the 
Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of 
repentance. <A name=C26V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this reason the Jews seized me in 
the temple, and tried to kill me. <A name=C26V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having therefore obtained the help 
that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying 
nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen, <A name=C26V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how the Christ 
must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to 
proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles." 
<P><A name=C26V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he thus made his defense, Festus 
said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you 
insane!" 
<P><A name=C26V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said, "I am not crazy, most 
excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness. <A 
name=C26V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the king knows of these things, to 
whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden 
from him, for this has not been done in a corner. <A name=C26V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>King Agrippa, do 
you believe the prophets? I know that you believe." 
<P><A name=C26V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little 
persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?" 
<P><A name=C26V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul said, "I pray to God, that 
whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this 
day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds." 
<P><A name=C26V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The king rose up with the governor, 
and Bernice, and those who sat with them. <A name=C26V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had 
withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of 
death or of bonds." <A name=C26V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Agrippa said to Festus, "This man 
might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar." 
<P><A name=C27V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When it was determined that we should 
sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion 
named Julius, of the Augustan band. <A name=C27V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, 
which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; 
Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. <A name=C27V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The next day, we 
touched at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to 
his friends and refresh himself. <A name=C27V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Putting to sea from there, we sailed 
under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. <A name=C27V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had sailed 
across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of 
Lycia. <A name=C27V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There the centurion found a ship of 
Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board. <A name=C27V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had sailed 
slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not 
allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. <A 
name=C27V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>With difficulty sailing along it we 
came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea. 
<P><A name=C27V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When much time had passed and the 
voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul 
admonished them, <A name=C27V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive 
that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the 
ship, but also of our lives." <A name=C27V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the centurion gave more heed to 
the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken 
by Paul. <A name=C27V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because the haven was not suitable to 
winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they 
could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking 
northeast and southeast. 
<P><A name=C27V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the south wind blew softly, 
supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed 
along Crete, close to shore. <A name=C27V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But before long, a tempestuous wind 
beat down from shore, which is called <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N44">Euroclydon.</A> <A 
name=C27V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the ship was caught, and couldn't 
face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along. <A name=C27V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Running under the 
lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure 
the boat. <A name=C27V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After they had hoisted it up, they 
used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on 
the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along. <A 
name=C27V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As we labored exceedingly with the 
storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard. <A name=C27V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the third day, 
they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands. <A name=C27V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When neither sun 
nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small tempest pressed on us, all 
hope that we would be saved was now taken away. 
<P><A name=C27V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had been long without food, 
Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened 
to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss. 
<A name=C27V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I exhort you to cheer up, for 
there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. <A 
name=C27V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there stood by me this night an 
angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve, <A name=C27V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, 'Don't be 
afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all 
those who sail with you.' <A name=C27V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I 
believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me. <A 
name=C27V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we must run aground on a certain 
island." 
<P><A name=C27V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the fourteenth night had 
come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the 
sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land. <A name=C27V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They took 
soundings, and found <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N45">twenty fathoms.</A> After a 
little while, they took soundings again, and found <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N46">fifteen fathoms.</A>. <A 
name=C27V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Fearing that we would run aground on 
rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight. 
<A name=C27V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As the sailors were trying to flee out 
of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would 
lay out anchors from the bow, <A name=C27V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul said to the centurion and to the 
soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be saved." <A 
name=C27V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes 
of the boat, and let it fall off. 
<P><A name=C27V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While the day was coming on, Paul 
begged them all to take some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that 
you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing. <A name=C27V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore I beg 
you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish 
from any of your heads." <A name=C27V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said this, and had taken 
bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began 
to eat. <A name=C27V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they all cheered up, and they 
also took food. <A name=C27V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In all, we were two hundred 
seventy-six souls on the ship. <A name=C27V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had eaten enough, they 
lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. <A name=C27V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When it was day, 
they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and 
they decided to try to drive the ship onto it. <A name=C27V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Casting off the 
anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. 
Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. <A 
name=C27V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But coming to a place where two seas 
met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the 
stern began to break up by the violence of the waves. 
<P><A name=C27V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The soldiers' counsel was to kill the 
prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape. <A name=C27V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the centurion, 
desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those 
who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land; <A 
name=C27V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the rest should follow, some on 
planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all 
escaped safely to the land. 
<P><A name=C28V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we had escaped, then <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N47">they</A> learned that the 
island was called Malta. <A name=C28V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The natives showed us uncommon 
kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present 
rain, and because of the cold. <A name=C28V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of 
sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and 
fastened on his hand. <A name=C28V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the natives saw the creature 
hanging from his hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a 
murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed

size=-1><SUP>28:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However he shook off the creature into 
the fire, and wasn't harmed. <A name=C28V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they expected that he would have 
swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and 
saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a 
god. 
<P><A name=C28V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the neighborhood of that place 
were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received 
us, and courteously entertained us for three days. <A name=C28V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened that 
the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, 
prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him. <A name=C28V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then when this was 
done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured. <A 
name=C28V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They also honored us with many honors, 
and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed. 
<P><A name=C28V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After three months, we set sail in a 
ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin 
Brothers." <A name=C28V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there 
three days. <A name=C28V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From there we circled around and 
arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day 
we came to Puteoli, <A name=C28V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>where we found <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Acts.htm#N48">brothers,</A> and were 
entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome. <A 
name=C28V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From there the brothers, when they 
heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three 
Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage. <A 
name=C28V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When we entered into Rome, the 
centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was 
allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him. 
<P><A name=C28V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened that after three days Paul 
called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come 
together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the 
people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from 
Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, <A name=C28V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, when they had examined me, 
desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me. <A 
name=C28V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the Jews spoke against it, I 
was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to 
accuse my nation. <A name=C28V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause therefore I asked to 
see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with 
this chain." 
<P><A name=C28V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said to him, "We neither received 
letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and 
report or speak any evil of you. <A name=C28V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we desire to hear from you what 
you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is 
spoken against." 
<P><A name=C28V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had appointed him a day, 
many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about 
the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of 
Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening. <A name=C28V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some believed the 
things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. <A name=C28V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they didn't 
agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy 
Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers, <A 
name=C28V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, 
<P>&nbsp;'Go to this people, and say, 
<P>&nbsp;In hearing, you will hear,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
will in no way understand. 
<P>&nbsp;In seeing, you will see,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
will in no way perceive. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C28V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this people's heart has grown 
callous.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ears are dull of 
hearing.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes they have closed. 
<P>&nbsp;Lest they should see with their 
eyes,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear with their 
ears,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand with their 
heart,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would turn 
again,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would heal them.' 
<P><A name=C28V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Be it known therefore to you, that 
the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles. They will also listen." 
<P><A name=C28V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said these words, the Jews 
departed, having a great dispute among themselves. 
<P><A name=C28V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul stayed two whole years in his own 
rented house, and received all who were coming to him, <A name=C28V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>preaching the 
Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with 
all boldness, without hinderance.
