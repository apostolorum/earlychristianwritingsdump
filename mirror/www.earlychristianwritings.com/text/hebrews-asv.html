<H1>Hebrews. The Epistle to the Hebrews</H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God, having of old time spoken unto the 
fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, <A 
name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>hath 
at the end of these days spoken unto us in <I>his</I> Son, whom he appointed 
heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds; <A name=C1V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who being the 
effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all 
things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down 
on the right hand of the Majesty on high; <A name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having become by so much better than the 
angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they. <A name=C1V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For unto which of 
the angels said he at any time, 
<P>&nbsp;Thou art my Son, 
<P>&nbsp;This day have I begotten thee? 
<P>and again, 
<P>&nbsp;I will be to him a Father, 
<P>&nbsp;And he shall be to me a Son? 
<P><A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he again bringeth in the 
firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. <A 
name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
of the angels he saith, 
<P>&nbsp;Who maketh his angels winds, 
<P>&nbsp;And his ministers a flame a fire: 
<P><A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but of the Son <I>he saith,</I> 
<P>&nbsp;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; 
<P>&nbsp;And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated 
iniquity; 
<P>&nbsp;Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee 
<P>&nbsp;With the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
<P><A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And, 
<P>&nbsp;Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, 
<P>&nbsp;And the heavens are the works of thy hands: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They shall perish; but thou continuest: 

<P>&nbsp;And they all shall wax old as doth a garment; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as a mantle shalt thou roll them 
up, 
<P>&nbsp;As a garment, and they shall be changed: 
<P>&nbsp;But thou art the same, 
<P>&nbsp;And thy years shall not fail. 
<P><A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But of which of the angels hath he said 
at any time, 
<P>&nbsp;Sit thou on my right hand, 
<P>&nbsp;Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet? 
<P><A name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Are they not all ministering spirits, 
sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation? 
<P>
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore we ought to give the more 
earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away <I>from 
them</I>. <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the word spoken through angels 
proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just 
recompense of reward; <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how shall we escape, if we neglect so 
great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was 
confirmed unto us by them that heard; <A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God also bearing witness with them, both 
by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, 
according to his own will. <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For not unto angels did he subject the 
world to come, whereof we speak. <A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But one hath somewhere testified, 
saying, 
<P>&nbsp;What is man, that thou art mindful of him? 
<P>&nbsp;Or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou madest him a little lower than the 
angels; 
<P>&nbsp;Thou crownedst him with glory and honor, 
<P>&nbsp;And didst set him over the works of thy hands: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou didst put all things in subjection 
under his feet. 
<P>For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not 
subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him. <A 
name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, <I>even</I> 
Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by 
the grace of God he should taste of death for every <I>man</I>. <A 
name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it became him, for whom are all 
things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to 
make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <A 
name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For both he that sanctifieth and they 
that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call 
them brethren, <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, 
<P>&nbsp;I will declare thy name unto my brethren, 
<P>&nbsp;In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise. 
<P><A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again, I will put my trust in him. 
And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me. <A 
name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Since then the children are sharers in 
flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that 
through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, 
the devil; <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and might deliver all them who through 
fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For verily not to 
angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham. <A 
name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore it behooved him in all things 
to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful 
high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of 
the people. <A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For in that he himself hath suffered 
being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted. 
<P>
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a 
heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, 
<I>even</I> Jesus; <A name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who was faithful to him that appointed 
him, as also was Moses in all his house. <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he hath been counted worthy of more 
glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the 
house. <A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For every house is builded by some one; 
but he that built all things is God. <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Moses indeed was faithful in all his 
house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be 
spoken; <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Christ as a son, over his house; 
whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope 
firm unto the end. <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit 
saith, 
<P>&nbsp;To-day if ye shall hear his voice, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Harden not your hearts, as in the 
provocation, 
<P>&nbsp;Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Where your fathers tried <I>me</I> by 
proving <I>me,</I> 
<P>&nbsp;And saw my works forty years. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore I was displeased with this 
generation, 
<P>&nbsp;And said, They do always err in their heart: 
<P>&nbsp;But they did not know my ways; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As I sware in my wrath, 
<P>&nbsp;They shall not enter into my rest. 
<P><A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take heed, brethren, lest haply there 
shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the 
living God: <A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but exhort one another day by day, so 
long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the 
deceitfulness of sin: <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for we are become partakers of Christ, 
if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end: <A 
name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while it is said, 
<P>&nbsp;To-day if ye shall hear his voice, 
<P>&nbsp;Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 
<P><A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For who, when they heard, did provoke? 
nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? <A name=C3V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And with whom was 
he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell 
in the wilderness? <A name=C3V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to whom sware he that they should 
not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? <A name=C3V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we see that 
they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a 
promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have 
come short of it. <A name=C4V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For indeed we have had good tidings 
preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit 
them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard. <A 
name=C4V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, 
<P>&nbsp;As I sware in my wrath, 
<P>&nbsp;They shall not enter into my rest: 
<P>although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. <A 
name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
he hath said somewhere of the seventh <I>day</I> on this wise, And God rested on 
the seventh day from all his works; <A name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and in this <I>place</I> again, 
<P>&nbsp;They shall not enter into my rest. 
<P><A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some 
should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached 
failed to enter in because of disobedience, <A name=C4V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he again defineth a 
certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been 
said before), 
<P>&nbsp;To-day if ye shall hear his voice, 
<P>&nbsp;Harden not your hearts. 
<P><A name=C4V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if Joshua had given them rest, he 
would not have spoken afterward of another day. <A name=C4V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There remaineth 
therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God. <A name=C4V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he that is 
entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from 
his. <A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let us therefore give diligence to 
enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience. 
<A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the word of God is living, and 
active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing 
of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts 
and intents of the heart. <A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there is no creature that is not 
manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of 
him with whom we have to do. <A name=C4V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having then a great high priest, who 
hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our 
confession. <A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we have not a high priest that 
cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in 
all points tempted like as <I>we are, yet</I> without sin. <A name=C4V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let us therefore 
draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and 
may find grace to help <I>us</I> in time of need. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For every high priest, being taken from 
among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer 
both gifts and sacrifices for sins: <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who can bear gently with the ignorant 
and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity; <A 
name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for 
sins. <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no man taketh the honor unto 
himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron. <A name=C5V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So Christ also 
glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, 
<P>&nbsp;Thou art my Son, 
<P>&nbsp;This day have I begotten thee: 
<P><A name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>as he saith also in another 
<I>place,</I> 
<P>&nbsp;Thou art a priest for ever 
<P>&nbsp;After the order of Melchizedek. 
<P><A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who in the days of his flesh, having 
offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that 
was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, <A 
name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>though he was a Son, yet learned 
obedience by the things which he suffered; <A name=C5V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and having been made 
perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation; 
<A name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>named of God a high priest after the 
order of Melchizedek. <A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Of whom we have many things to say, and 
hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing. <A 
name=C5V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For when by reason of the time ye ought 
to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the 
first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of 
milk, and not of solid food. <A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For every one that partaketh of milk is 
without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe. <A 
name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But solid food is for fullgrown men, 
<I>even</I> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern 
good and evil. 
<P>
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the 
first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a 
foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, <A 
name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>of 
the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the 
dead, and of eternal judgment. <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this will we do, if God permit. <A 
name=C6V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and 
were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and tasted the good word of God, and the 
powers of the age to come, <A name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and <I>then</I> fell away, it is 
impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to 
themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. <A 
name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth 
herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from 
God: <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but if it beareth thorns and thistles, 
it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned. <A 
name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But, 
beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany 
salvation, though we thus speak: <A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for God is not unrighteous to forget 
your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered 
unto the saints, and still do minister. <A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we desire that each one of you may 
show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end: <A 
name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that ye be not sluggish, but imitators 
of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. <A name=C6V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For when God made 
promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself, 
<A name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Surely blessing I will bless 
thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. <A name=C6V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And thus, having 
patiently endured, he obtained the promise. <A name=C6V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For men swear by 
the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation. 
<A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherein God, being minded to show more 
abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, 
interposed with an oath; <A name=C6V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that by two immutable things, in which 
it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have 
fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us: <A name=C6V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which we have as an 
anchor of the soul, <I>a hope</I> both sure and stedfast and entering into that 
which is within the veil; <A name=C6V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whither as a forerunner Jesus entered 
for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, 
priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the 
kings and blessed him, <A name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to whom also Abraham divided a tenth 
part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then 
also King of Salem, which is King of peace; <A name=C7V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>without father, 
without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of 
life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually. <A 
name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now 
consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth 
out of the chief spoils. <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they indeed of the sons of Levi that 
receive the priest's office have commandment to take tithes of the people 
according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of 
the loins of Abraham: <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he whose genealogy is not counted 
from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the 
promises. <A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But without any dispute the less is 
blessed of the better. <A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And here men that die receive tithes; 
but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. <A name=C7V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And, so to say, 
through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes; <A 
name=C7V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he was yet in the loins of his 
father, when Melchizedek met him. <A name=C7V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now if there was perfection through the 
Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what 
further need <I>was there</I> that another priest should arise after the order 
of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron? <A 
name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the priesthood being changed, there 
is made of necessity a change also of the law. <A name=C7V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he of whom 
these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given 
attendance at the altar. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is evident that our Lord hath 
sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests. 
<A name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And <I>what we say</I> is yet more 
abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another 
priest, <A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who hath been made, not after the law 
of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life: <A 
name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for it is witnessed <I>of him,</I> 
<P>&nbsp;Thou art a priest for ever 
<P>&nbsp;After the order of Melchizedek. 
<P><A name=C7V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there is a disannulling of a 
foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness <A 
name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(for the law made nothing perfect), and 
a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God. 
<A name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And inasmuch as <I>it is</I> not 
without the taking of an oath <A name=C7V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(for they indeed have been made priests 
without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, 
<P>&nbsp;The Lord sware and will not repent himself, 
<P>&nbsp;Thou art a priest for ever); 
<P><A name=C7V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>by so much also hath Jesus become the 
surety of a better covenant. <A name=C7V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they indeed have been made priests 
many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing: <A 
name=C7V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he, because he abideth for ever, 
hath his priesthood unchangeable. <A name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore also he is able to save to 
the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to 
make intercession for them. <A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For such a high priest became us, holy, 
guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
<A name=C7V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who needeth not daily, like those high 
priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the 
<I>sins</I> of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up 
himself. <A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the law appointeth men high 
priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, 
<I>appointeth</I> a Son, perfected for evermore. 
<P>
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the things which we are saying 
the chief point <I>is this</I>: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the 
right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, <A name=C8V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>a minister of the 
sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. <A 
name=C8V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it 
is necessary that this <I>high priest</I> also have somewhat to offer. <A 
name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now 
if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who 
offer the gifts according to the law; <A name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who serve <I>that which is</I> a copy 
and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned <I>of God</I> when he 
is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things 
according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount. <A name=C8V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now hath he 
obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of 
a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises. <A 
name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
if that first <I>covenant</I> had been faultless, then would no place have been 
sought for a second. <A name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For finding fault with them, he saith, 
<P>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the 
house of Judah; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not according to the covenant that I 
made with their fathers 
<P>&nbsp;In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the 
land of Egypt; 
<P>&nbsp;For they continued not in my covenant, 
<P>&nbsp;And I regarded them not, saith the Lord. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this is the covenant that I will 
make with the house of Israel 
<P>&nbsp;After those days, saith the Lord; 
<P>&nbsp;I will put my laws into their mind, 
<P>&nbsp;And on their heart also will I write them: 
<P>&nbsp;And I will be to them a God, 
<P>&nbsp;And they shall be to me a people: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they shall not teach every man his 
fellow-citizen, 
<P>&nbsp;And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: 
<P>&nbsp;For all shall know me, 
<P>&nbsp;From the least to the greatest of them. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I will be merciful to their 
iniquities, 
<P>&nbsp;And their sins will I remember no more. 
<P><A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In that he saith, A new <I>covenant</I> 
he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is 
nigh unto vanishing away. 
<P>
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now even a first <I>covenant</I> had 
ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, <I>a sanctuary</I> of this 
world. <A name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there was a tabernacle prepared, the 
first, wherein <I>were</I> the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; 
which is called the Holy place. <A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after the second veil, the 
tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies; <A name=C9V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having a golden 
altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, 
wherein <I>was</I> a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, 
and the tables of the covenant; <A name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and above it cherubim of glory 
overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally. <A 
name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now 
these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the 
first tabernacle, accomplishing the services; <A name=C9V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but into the second 
the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth 
for himself, and for the errors of the people: <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the Holy Spirit this 
signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, 
while the first tabernacle is yet standing; <A name=C9V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which <I>is</I> a 
figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and 
sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect, 
<A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>being</I> only (with meats and 
drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of 
reformation. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Christ having come a high priest of 
the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not 
made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, <A name=C9V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>nor yet through the 
blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all 
into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption. <A name=C9V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the blood of 
goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been 
defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh: <A name=C9V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how much more shall 
the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without 
blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living 
God? <A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And for this cause he is the mediator 
of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the 
transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called 
may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. <A name=C9V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For where a 
testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it. <A 
name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For a testament is of force where there 
hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth. <A 
name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore even the first 
<I>covenant</I> hath not been dedicated without blood. <A name=C9V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For when every 
commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, 
he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and 
hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <A 
name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, This is the blood of the 
covenant which God commanded to you-ward. <A name=C9V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moreover the 
tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with 
the blood. <A name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And according to the law, I may almost 
say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there 
is no remission. <A name=C9V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It was necessary therefore that the 
copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the 
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <A 
name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Christ entered not into a holy 
place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now 
to appear before the face of God for us: <A name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>nor yet that he should offer himself 
often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood 
not his own; <A name=C9V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>else must he often have suffered since 
the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been 
manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <A name=C9V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And inasmuch as it 
is appointed unto men once to die, and after this <I>cometh</I> judgment; <A 
name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so 
Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a 
second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation. 
<P>
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the law having a shadow of the good 
<I>things</I> to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same 
sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that 
draw nigh. <A name=C10V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Else would they not have ceased to be 
offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no 
more consciousness of sins. <A name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But in those <I>sacrifices</I> there is 
a remembrance made of sins year by year. <A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is impossible that the blood of 
bulls and goats should take away sins. <A name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore when he cometh into the 
world, he saith, 
<P>&nbsp;Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, 
<P>&nbsp;But a body didst thou prepare for me; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C10V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In whole burnt offerings and 
<I>sacrifices</I> for sin thou hadst no pleasure: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll 
of the book it is written of me) 
<P>&nbsp;To do thy will, O God. 
<P><A name=C10V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings 
and whole burnt offerings and <I>sacrifices</I> for sin thou wouldest not, 
neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law), <A 
name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do 
thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. <A 
name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By which will we have been sanctified 
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <A 
name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And every priest indeed standeth day 
by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can 
never take away sins: <A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he, when he had offered one 
sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; <A 
name=C10V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>henceforth expecting till his enemies 
be made the footstool of his feet. <A name=C10V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For by one offering he hath perfected 
for ever them that are sanctified. <A name=C10V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Holy Spirit also beareth 
witness to us; for after he hath said, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C10V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is the covenant that I will make 
with them 
<P>&nbsp;After those days, saith the Lord: 
<P>&nbsp;I will put my laws on their heart, 
<P>&nbsp;And upon their mind also will I write them; 
<P><I>then saith he,</I> 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C10V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And their sins and their iniquities 
will I remember no more. 
<P><A name=C10V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now where remission of these is, there 
is no more offering for sin. <A name=C10V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having therefore, brethren, boldness 
to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, <A name=C10V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>by the way which 
he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his 
flesh; <A name=C10V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and <I>having</I> a great priest over 
the house of God; <A name=C10V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>let us draw near with a true heart in 
fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and 
having our body washed with pure water, <A name=C10V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>let us hold fast the confession of our 
hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised: <A name=C10V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and let us 
consider one another to provoke unto love and good works; <A name=C10V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>not forsaking our 
own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting <I>one 
another</I>; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh. <A 
name=C10V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if we sin wilfully after that we 
have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice 
for sins, <A name=C10V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but a certain fearful expectation of 
judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries. <A 
name=C10V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A man that hath set at nought Moses 
law dieth without compassion on <I>the word of</I> two or three witnesses: <A 
name=C10V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>of how much sorer punishment, think 
ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and 
hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy 
thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? <A name=C10V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we know him 
that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord 
shall judge his people. <A name=C10V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is a fearful thing to fall into the 
hands of the living God. <A name=C10V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But call to remembrance the former 
days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of 
sufferings; <A name=C10V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>partly, being made a gazingstock both 
by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that 
were so used. <A name=C10V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye both had compassion on them 
that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions, knowing 
that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one. <A 
name=C10V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Cast not away therefore your boldness, 
which hath great recompense of reward. <A name=C10V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye have need of patience, that, 
having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C10V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For yet a very little while, 
<P>&nbsp;He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C10V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But my righteous one shall live by 
faith: 
<P>&nbsp;And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him. 
<P><A name=C10V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we are not of them that shrink 
back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul. 
<P>
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now faith is assurance of <I>things</I> 
hoped for, a conviction of things not seen. <A name=C11V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For therein the 
elders had witness borne to them. <A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith we understand that the worlds 
have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out 
of things which appear. <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Abel offered unto God a more 
excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he 
was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he 
being dead yet speaketh. <A name=C11V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Enoch was translated that he 
should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he 
hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been 
well-pleasing unto God: <A name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And without faith it is impossible to 
be well-pleasing <I>unto him</I>; for he that cometh to God must believe that he 
is, and <I>that</I> he is a rewarder of them that seek after him. <A 
name=C11V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By 
faith Noah, being warned <I>of God</I> concerning things not seen as yet, moved 
with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he 
condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to 
faith. <A name=C11V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Abraham, when he was called, 
obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he 
went out, not knowing whither he went. <A name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith he became a sojourner in the 
land of promise, as in a <I>land</I> not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac 
and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: <A name=C11V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he looked for 
the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God. <A 
name=C11V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith even Sarah herself received 
power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who 
had promised: <A name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>wherefore also there sprang of one, 
and him as good as dead, <I>so many</I> as the stars of heaven in multitude, and 
as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable. <A name=C11V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These all died in 
faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them 
from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the 
earth. <A name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they that say such things make it 
manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own. <A 
name=C11V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if indeed they had been mindful of 
that <I>country</I> from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to 
return. <A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now they desire a better 
<I>country</I>, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be 
called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city. <A name=C11V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Abraham, 
being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was 
offering up his only begotten <I>son</I>; <A name=C11V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even he to whom it 
was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: <A name=C11V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>accounting that 
God <I>is</I> able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a 
figure receive him back. <A name=C11V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, 
even concerning things to come. <A name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, 
blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <I>leaning</I> upon the top 
of his staff. <A name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Joseph, when his end was 
nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave 
commandment concerning his bones. <A name=C11V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Moses, when he was born, was 
hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and 
they were not afraid of the king's commandment. <A name=C11V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Moses, 
when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; <A 
name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>choosing rather to share ill treatment 
with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; <A 
name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>accounting the reproach of Christ 
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of 
reward. <A name=C11V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing 
the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. <A 
name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith he kept the passover, and the 
sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch 
them. <A name=C11V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith they passed through the Red 
sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up. <A 
name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith the walls of Jericho fell 
down, after they had been compassed about for seven days. <A name=C11V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By faith Rahab the 
harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies 
with peace. <A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And what shall I more say? for the 
time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and 
Samuel and the prophets: <A name=C11V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who through faith subdued kingdoms, 
wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, <A 
name=C11V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>quenched the power of fire, escaped 
the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, 
turned to flight armies of aliens. <A name=C11V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Women received their dead by a 
resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that 
they might obtain a better resurrection: <A name=C11V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and others had 
trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: <A 
name=C11V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they were stoned, they were sawn 
asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in 
sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated <A 
name=C11V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(of whom the world was not worthy), 
wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth. <A 
name=C11V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And these all, having had witness 
borne to them through their faith, received not the promise, <A 
name=C11V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God having provided some better thing 
concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect. 
<P>
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let us also, seeing we are 
compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and 
the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race 
that is set before us, <A name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>looking unto Jesus the author and 
perfecter of <I>our</I> faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured 
the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of 
God. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For consider him that hath endured such 
gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your 
souls. <A name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, 
striving against sin: <A name=C12V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and ye have forgotten the exhortation 
which reasoneth with you as with sons, 
<P>&nbsp;My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;Nor faint when thou art reproved of him; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, 

<P>&nbsp;And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. 
<P><A name=C12V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is for chastening that ye endure; 
God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom <I>his</I> father 
chasteneth not? <A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if ye are without chastening, 
whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. <A 
name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our 
flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in 
subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? <A name=C12V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they indeed 
for a few days chastened <I>us</I> as seemed good to them; but he for <I>our</I> 
profit, that <I>we</I> may be partakers of his holiness. <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All chastening 
seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth 
peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, <I>even the 
fruit</I> of righteousness. <A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore lift up the hands that hang 
down, and the palsied knees; <A name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and make straight paths for your feet, 
that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed. <A 
name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Follow after peace with all men, and 
the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord: <A name=C12V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>looking carefully 
lest <I>there be</I> any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any 
root of bitterness springing up trouble <I>you</I>, and thereby the many be 
defiled; <A name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>lest <I>there be</I> any fornication, 
or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright. <A 
name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye know that even when he 
afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no 
place for a change of mind <I>in his father,</I> though he sought is diligently 
with tears. <A name=C12V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye are not come unto <I>a 
mount</I> that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, 
and darkness, and tempest, <A name=C12V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the sound of a trumpet, and the 
voice of words; which <I>voice</I> they that heard entreated that no word more 
should be spoken unto them; <A name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they could not endure that which 
was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned; <A 
name=C12V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and so fearful was the appearance, 
<I>that</I> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake: <A name=C12V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but ye are come 
unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, 
and to innumerable hosts of angels, <A name=C12V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to the general assembly and church of 
the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to 
the spirits of just men made perfect, <A name=C12V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to Jesus the mediator of a new 
covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than <I>that 
of</I> Abel. <A name=C12V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>See that ye refuse not him that 
speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned <I>them</I> 
on earth, much more <I>shall not</I> we <I>escape</I> who turn away from him 
that <I>warneth</I> from heaven: <A name=C12V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whose voice then shook the earth: but 
now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth 
only, but also the heaven. <A name=C12V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this <I>word</I>, Yet once more, 
signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have 
been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain. <A 
name=C12V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that 
cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing 
to God with reverence and awe: <A name=C12V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for our God is a consuming fire. 
<P>
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let love of the brethren continue. <A 
name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Forget not to show love unto strangers: 
for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. <A name=C13V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Remember them that 
are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are illtreated, as being yourselves 
also in the body. <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>Let</I> marriage <I>be</I> had in 
honor among all, and <I>let</I> the bed <I>be</I> undefiled: for fornicators and 
adulterers God will judge. <A name=C13V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be ye free from the love of money; 
content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise 
fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee. <A name=C13V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So that with good 
courage we say, 
<P>&nbsp;The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: 
<P>&nbsp;What shall man do unto me? 
<P><A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Remember them that had the rule over 
you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their 
life, imitate their faith. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus Christ <I>is</I> the same 
yesterday and to-day, <I>yea</I> and for ever. <A name=C13V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be not carried away 
by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by 
grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited. <A 
name=C13V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We have an altar, whereof they have no 
right to eat that serve the tabernacle. <A name=C13V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the bodies of those beasts whose 
blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest <I>as an offering</I> 
for sin, are burned without the camp. <A name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might 
sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate. <A 
name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let us therefore go forth unto him 
without the camp, bearing his reproach. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we have not here an abiding city, 
but we seek after <I>the city</I> which is to come. <A name=C13V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Through him then 
let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of 
lips which make confession to his name. <A name=C13V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to do good and to communicate 
forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. <A name=C13V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Obey them that 
have the rule over you, and submit <I>to them</I>: for they watch in behalf of 
your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and 
not with grief: for this <I>were</I> unprofitable for you. <A name=C13V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pray for us: for 
we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in 
all things. <A name=C13V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I exhort <I>you</I> the more 
exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. <A 
name=C13V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the God of peace, who brought 
again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal 
covenant, <I>even</I> our Lord Jesus, <A name=C13V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>make you perfect in every good thing 
to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through 
Jesus Christ; to whom <I>be</I> the glory for ever and ever. Amen. <A 
name=C13V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I exhort you, brethren, bear with 
the word of exhortation, for I have written unto you in few words. <A 
name=C13V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Know ye that our brother Timothy hath 
been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. <A 
name=C13V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Salute all them that have the rule 
over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. <A name=C13V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Grace be with you 
all. Amen.
