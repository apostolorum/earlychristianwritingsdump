<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the will of God, and Timothy our brother, <A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to the saints and faithful <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Col.htm#N1">brothers</A> in Christ at 
Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<P><A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We give thanks to God the Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, <A name=C1V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having heard of your 
faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints, <A 
name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because of the hope which is laid up for 
you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the 
Gospel, <A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which has come to you; even as it is in 
all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since 
the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth; <A name=C1V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even as you learned 
of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on 
our behalf, <A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who also declared to us your love in the 
Spirit. <A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause, we also, since the day 
we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be 
filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
<A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that you may walk worthily of the Lord, 
to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing 
in the knowledge of God; <A name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>strengthened with all power, according 
to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy; <A 
name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>giving thanks to the Father, who made 
us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; <A 
name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who delivered us out of the power of 
darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love; <A 
name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in 
whom we have our redemption,<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP><A

forgiveness of our sins; <A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who is the image of the invisible God, 
the firstborn of all creation. <A name=C1V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For by him were all things created, in 
the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether 
thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created 
through him, and for him. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is before all things, and in him all 
things are held together. <A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is the head of the body, the 
assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things 
he might have the preeminence. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For all the fullness was pleased to 
dwell in him; <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and through him to reconcile all things 
to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, 
having made peace through the blood of his cross. 
<P><A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You, being in past times alienated and 
enemies in your mind in your evil works, <A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yet now he has reconciled in the body 
of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and 
blameless before him, <A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>if it is so that you continue in the 
faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel 
which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of 
which I, Paul, was made a servant. 
<P><A name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your 
sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ 
in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly; <A name=C1V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>of which I was made 
a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to 
fulfill the word of God, <A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the mystery which has been hidden for 
ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints, <A 
name=C1V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to 
whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this 
mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; <A 
name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom we proclaim, admonishing every man 
and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in 
Christ Jesus; <A name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for which I also labor, striving 
according to his working, which works in me mightily. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I desire to have you know how 
greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have 
not seen my face in the flesh; <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that their hearts may be comforted, they 
being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of 
understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of 
Christ, <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in whom are all the treasures of wisdom 
and knowledge hidden. <A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this I say that no one may delude 
you with persuasiveness of speech. <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet 
am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the 
steadfastness of your faith in Christ. <A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As therefore you received Christ Jesus, 
the Lord, walk in him, <A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>rooted and built up in him, and 
established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in 
thanksgiving. <A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be careful that you don't let anyone rob 
you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after 
the elements of the world, and not after Christ. <A name=C2V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For in him all the 
fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, <A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and in him you are made full, who is 
the head of all principality and power; <A name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in whom you were also circumcised with 
a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins 
of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; <A name=C2V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having been buried 
with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the 
working of God, who raised him from the dead. <A name=C2V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You were dead 
through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive 
together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, <A name=C2V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>wiping out the 
handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the 
way, nailing it to the cross; <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having stripped the principalities and 
the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 
<P><A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let no man therefore judge you in 
eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a 
Sabbath day, <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which are a shadow of the things to 
come; but the body is Christ's. <A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let no one rob you of your prize by a 
voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which 
he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, <A name=C2V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and not holding 
firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together 
through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth. <A name=C2V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If you died with 
Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do 
you subject yourselves to ordinances, <A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch" <A 
name=C2V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(all of which perish with use), 
according to the precepts and doctrines of men? <A name=C2V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which things indeed 
appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the 
body; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh. 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If then you were raised together with 
Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right 
hand of God. <A name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Set your mind on the things that are 
above, not on the things that are on the earth. <A name=C3V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you died, and 
your life is hidden with Christ in God. <A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Christ, our life, is revealed, then 
you will also be revealed with him in glory. <A name=C3V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Put to death 
therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, 
depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry; <A 
name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for 
which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. <A 
name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You 
also once walked in those, when you lived in them; <A name=C3V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but now you also put 
them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your 
mouth. <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't lie to one another, seeing that 
you have put off the old man with his doings, <A name=C3V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and have put on the 
new man, that is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator, <A 
name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>where there can't be Greek and Jew, 
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but 
Christ is all, and in all. 
<P><A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, 
holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and 
perseverance; <A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>bearing with one another, and forgiving 
each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, 
so you also do. 
<P><A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Above all these things, walk in love, 
which is the bond of perfection. <A name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And let the peace of God rule in your 
hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. <A 
name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let the word of Christ dwell in you 
richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, 
and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord. 
<P><A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do 
all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him. 

<P><A name=C3V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wives, be in subjection to your 
husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
<P><A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Husbands, love your wives, and don't be 
bitter against them. 
<P><A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Children, obey your parents in all 
things, for this pleases the Lord. 
<P><A name=C3V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Fathers, don't provoke your children, 
so that they won't be discouraged. 
<P><A name=C3V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT
