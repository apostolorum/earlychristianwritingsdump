                  of the hypothetical source employed by the author of the fourth 

                  gospel is derived from the analysis found in Robert Fortna's 

                  <i>The Fourth Gospel and Its Predecessor. </i>The text of the 

                  Signs Gospel has been reconstructed using the New Revised Standard 

                  Version (NRSV) of the Gospel of John; differences between the 

                  text of the Signs Gospel and the NRSV are printed in italics."</p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(19) This

                        <i>came </i>to ask him, "Who are you?" </span></p>

                        to Israel. I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like 

                        a dove on him. (34) And I myself have seen and have testified 

                        that this is the Son of God." </span></p>

                        Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them 

                        to the end. (2) The devil had already put it into the 

                        heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And 

                        during supper (3) Jesus, knowing that the Father had given 

                        all things into his hands, and that he had come from God

                        Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the 

                        disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was 

                        tied around him. (6) He came to Simon Peter, who said

                        clean, though not all of you." (11) For he knew who was 

                        to betray him; for this reason he said, "Not all of you

                        to wash one another's feet. (15) For I have set you an 

                        example, that you also should do as I have done to you. 

                        (16) Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater

                        the scripture, 'The one who ate my bread has lifted his

                        name was Malchus. </span></p>

                        disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known 

                        to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard 

                        of the high priest, (16) but Peter was standing outside 

                        at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the 

                        high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded 

                        the gate, and brought Peter in. </span></p>

                        is what the soldiers did. Meanwhile, standing near the 

                        cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, 

                        Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. (28) After 

                        this, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), "I 

                        am thirsty." </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(29) A jar 

                        full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge 

                        full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to 

                        his mouth. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(30) When 

                        Jesus had received the wine, he said, "It is finished." 

                        Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(31) Since 

                        it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the 

                        bodies left on the cross during the sabbath. So they asked 

                        Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and 

                        the bodies removed. (32) Then the soldiers came and broke 

                        the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified 

                        with him. (33) But when they came to Jesus and saw that 

                        he was already dead, they did not break his legs. (34) 

                        Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, 

                        and at once blood and water came out. (36) These things 

                        occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, "None 

                        of his bones shall be broken." </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(37) And again 

                        another passage of scripture says, "They will look on 

                        the one whom they have pierced." (38) After these things, 

                        Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, asked 

                        Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate 

                        gave him permission; so he came and removed his body and 

                        wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(41) Now there 

                        was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and 

                        in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had 

                        ever been laid. (42) And so, because it was the day of 

                        Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus 

                        there. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(1) Early 

                        on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the 

                        tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the 

                        tomb. (2) So she ran and went to Simon Peter and said, 

                        "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not 

                        know where they have laid him." </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(3) Then Peter 

                        set out and went toward the tomb and went into the tomb. 

                        (9) For as yet they did not understand the scripture, 

                        that he must rise from the dead. (10) Then <i>he </i>returned 

                        to <i>his </i>home. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(11) But Mary 

                        stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent 

                        over to look into the tomb; (12) and she saw two angels 

                        in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, 

                        one at the head and the other at the feet. (14) She turned 

                        around and saw Jesus standing there. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(15) Jesus 

                        said to her, "Whom are you looking for, Mary?&quot; </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">She said to 

                        him in Hebrew, "Rabbouni!.&quot; </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(17) Jesus 

                        said to her, "Do not hold on to me. But go to my brothers.&quot; 

                        </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(18) Mary 

                        Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have 

                        seen the Lord.&quot; </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(19) When 

                        it was evening on that day and the doors of the house 

                        where the disciples had met were locked, Jesus came and 

                        stood among them and said, "Peace be with you." (20) He 

                        showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples 

                        rejoiced when they saw the Lord. </span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(22) He breathed 

                        on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.&quot;</span></p>

                      <p align="left"><span class="translationtext">(30) Now Jesus 

                        did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, 

                        which are not written in this book. (31) But these are 

                        written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is 

                        the Messiah, the Son of God.</span></p>
