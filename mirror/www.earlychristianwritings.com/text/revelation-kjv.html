<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Revelation</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto 
him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he 
sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:<BR>[<B>2</B>] Who bare 
record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all 
things that he saw.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear 
the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for 
the time is at hand.<BR>[<B>4</B>] John to the seven churches which are in Asia: 
Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to 
come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the 
dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and 
washed us from our sins in his own blood,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And hath made us kings 
and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and 
ever. Amen.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see 
him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail 
because of him. Even so, Amen.<BR>[<B>8</B>] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning 
and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, 
the Almighty.<BR>[<B>9</B>] I John, who also am your brother, and companion in 
tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle 
that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus 
Christ.<BR>[<B>10</B>] I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind 
me a great voice, as of a trumpet,<BR>[<B>11</B>] Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, 
the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto 
the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto 
Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto 
Laodicea.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And 
being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<BR>[<B>13</B>] And in the midst 
of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment 
down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were 
as a flame of fire;<BR>[<B>15</B>] And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they 
burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<BR>[<B>16</B>] 
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp 
twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his 
strength.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he 
laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the 
last:<BR>[<B>18</B>] I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive 
for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Write 
the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which 
shall be hereafter;<BR>[<B>20</B>] The mystery of the seven stars which thou 
sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are 
the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest 
are the seven churches.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These 
things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in 
the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;<BR>[<B>2</B>] I know thy works, and 
thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: 
and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast 
found them liars:<BR>[<B>3</B>] And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my 
name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Nevertheless I 
have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first 
works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick 
out of his place, except thou repent.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But this thou hast, that 
thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.<BR>[<B>7</B>] He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him 
that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of 
the paradise of God.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna 
write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is 
alive;<BR>[<B>9</B>] I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou 
art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, 
but are the synagogue of Satan.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Fear none of those things which 
thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye 
may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto 
death, and I will give thee a crown of life.<BR>[<B>11</B>] He that hath an ear, 
let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall 
not be hurt of the second death.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And to the angel of the church 
in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two 
edges;<BR>[<B>13</B>] I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where 
Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, 
even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among 
you, where Satan dwelleth.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But I have a few things against thee, 
because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac 
to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed 
unto idols, and to commit fornication.<BR>[<B>15</B>] So hast thou also them 
that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.<BR>[<B>16</B>] 
Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with 
the sword of my mouth.<BR>[<B>17</B>] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the 
Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the 
hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name 
written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And 
unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of 
God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine 
brass;<BR>[<B>19</B>] I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and 
thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the 
first.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because 
thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach 
and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed 
unto idols.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; 
and she repented not.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and 
them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of 
their deeds.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And I will kill her children with death; and all the 
churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I 
will give unto every one of you according to your works.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But unto 
you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and 
which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you 
none other burden.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But that which ye have already hold fast till 
I come.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the 
end, to him will I give power over the nations:<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he shall rule 
them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to 
shivers: even as I received of my Father.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And I will give him the 
morning star.<BR>[<B>29</B>] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
saith unto the churches.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These 
things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know 
thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for 
I have not found thy works perfect before God.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Remember therefore 
how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou 
shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what 
hour I will come upon thee.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Thou hast a few names even in Sardis 
which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for 
they are worthy.<BR>[<B>5</B>] He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in 
white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I 
will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.<BR>[<B>6</B>] He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; 
These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of 
David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man 
openeth;<BR>[<B>8</B>] I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open 
door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my 
word, and hast not denied my name.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Behold, I will make them of the 
synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I 
will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have 
loved thee.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I 
also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the 
world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Behold, I come 
quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy 
crown.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of 
my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my 
God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh 
down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new 
name.<BR>[<B>13</B>] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith 
unto the churches.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And unto the angel of the church of the 
Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, 
the beginning of the creation of God;<BR>[<B>15</B>] I know thy works, that thou 
art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<BR>[<B>16</B>] So then 
because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my 
mouth.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, 
and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, 
and poor, and blind, and naked:<BR>[<B>18</B>] I counsel thee to buy of me gold 
tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest 
be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine 
eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.<BR>[<B>19</B>] As many as I love, I 
rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Behold, I 
stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I 
will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<BR>[<B>21</B>] To 
him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also 
overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.<BR>[<B>22</B>] He that 
hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in 
heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking 
with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be 
hereafter.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a 
throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he that 
sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow 
round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And round 
about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and 
twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads 
crowns of gold.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and 
thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the 
throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And before the throne 
there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and 
round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and 
behind.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast 
like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was 
like a flying eagle.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the four beasts had each of them six 
wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and 
night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to 
come.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to 
him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,<BR>[<B>10</B>] The 
four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship 
him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, 
saying,<BR>[<B>11</B>] Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and 
power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were 
created.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the 
throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven 
seals.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who 
is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<BR>[<B>3</B>] And no 
man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, 
neither to look thereon.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And I wept much, because no man was found 
worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of 
Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven 
seals thereof.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne 
and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had 
been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of 
God sent forth into all the earth.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he came and took the book 
out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And when he 
had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before 
the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which 
are the prayers of saints.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they sung a new song, saying, Thou 
art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, 
and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and 
people, and nation;<BR>[<B>10</B>] And hast made us unto our God kings and 
priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And I beheld, and I 
heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the 
elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and 
thousands of thousands;<BR>[<B>12</B>] Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the 
Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and 
honour, and glory, and blessing.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And every creature which is in 
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and 
all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and 
power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and 
ever.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty 
elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I 
heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and 
see.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him 
had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to 
conquer.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the 
second beast say, Come and see.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And there went out another horse 
that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the 
earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a 
great sword.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the 
third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that 
sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And I heard a voice 
in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three 
measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the 
wine.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of 
the fourth beast say, Come and see.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And I looked, and behold a 
pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. 
And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with 
sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the 
earth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the 
altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the 
testimony which they held:<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they cried with a loud voice, 
saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our 
blood on them that dwell on the earth?<BR>[<B>11</B>] And white robes were given 
unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for 
a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should 
be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And I beheld when he 
had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun 
became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her 
untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the 
heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and 
island were moved out of their places.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And the kings of the 
earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the 
mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens 
and in the rocks of the mountains;<BR>[<B>16</B>] And said to the mountains and 
rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, 
and from the wrath of the Lamb:<BR>[<B>17</B>] For the great day of his wrath is 
come; and who shall be able to stand?<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] And after these things I saw four angels standing on 
the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the 
wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any 
tree.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the 
seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to 
whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Saying, Hurt not 
the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of 
our God in their foreheads.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And I heard the number of them which 
were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all 
the tribes of the children of Israel.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Of the tribe of Juda were 
sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of 
the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Of the tribe of Aser 
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve 
thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Of 
the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were 
sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve 
thousand.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of 
the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were 
sealed twelve thousand.<BR>[<B>9</B>] After this I beheld, and, lo, a great 
multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, 
and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white 
robes, and palms in their hands;<BR>[<B>10</B>] And cried with a loud voice, 
saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the 
Lamb.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about 
the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and 
worshipped God,<BR>[<B>12</B>] Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, 
and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and 
ever. Amen.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What 
are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which 
came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white 
in the blood of the Lamb.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Therefore are they before the throne of 
God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the 
throne shall dwell among them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] They shall hunger no more, neither 
thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any 
heat.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed 
them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe 
away all tears from their eyes.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was 
silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I saw the 
seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven 
trumpets.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a 
golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer 
it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the 
throne.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers 
of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it 
into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an 
earthquake.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets 
prepared themselves to sound.<BR>[<B>7</B>] The first angel sounded, and there 
followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: 
and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt 
up.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain 
burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became 
blood;<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, 
and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were 
destroyed.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great 
star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of 
the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the name of the 
star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and 
many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the 
third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of 
them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night 
likewise.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the 
midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of 
the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, 
which are yet to sound!<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from 
heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless 
pit.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out 
of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were 
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And there came out of 
the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the 
scorpions of the earth have power.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And it was commanded them that 
they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither 
any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their 
foreheads.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And to them it was given that they should not kill 
them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as 
the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And in those 
days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and 
death shall flee from them.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the shapes of the locusts were 
like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns 
like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they had 
hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of 
lions.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; 
and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running 
to battle.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were 
stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five 
months.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the 
bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek 
tongue hath his name Apollyon.<BR>[<B>12</B>] One woe is past; and, behold, 
there come two woes more hereafter.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And the sixth angel sounded, 
and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before 
God,<BR>[<B>14</B>] Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the 
four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And the 
four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a 
month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the 
number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I 
heard the number of them.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And thus I saw the horses in the 
vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, 
and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out 
of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.<BR>[<B>18</B>] By these 
three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by 
the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For their power 
is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, 
and had heads, and with them they do hurt.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And the rest of the 
men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of 
their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, 
and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor 
walk:<BR>[<B>21</B>] Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their 
sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, 
clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it 
were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he had in his 
hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left 
foot on the earth,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion 
roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their 
voices.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I 
was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up 
those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his 
hand to heaven,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, 
who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the 
things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that 
there should be time no longer:<BR>[<B>7</B>] But in the days of the voice of 
the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be 
finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take 
the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the 
sea and upon the earth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And I went unto the angel, and said unto 
him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and 
it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as 
honey.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and 
ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, 
my belly was bitter.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy 
again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the 
angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and 
them that worship therein.<BR>[<B>2</B>] But the court which is without the 
temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the 
holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And I 
will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two 
hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.<BR>[<B>4</B>] These are the 
two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the 
earth.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their 
mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in 
this manner be killed.<BR>[<B>6</B>] These have power to shut heaven, that it 
rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them 
to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they 
will.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast 
that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall 
overcome them, and kill them.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And their dead bodies shall lie in 
the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where 
also our Lord was crucified.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they of the people and kindreds 
and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and 
shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they 
that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall 
send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt 
on the earth.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And after three days and an half the Spirit of life 
from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell 
upon them which saw them.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they heard a great voice from 
heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a 
cloud; and their enemies beheld them.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And the same hour was there 
a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake 
were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave 
glory to the God of heaven.<BR>[<B>14</B>] The second woe is past; and, behold, 
the third woe cometh quickly.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And the seventh angel sounded; and 
there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become 
the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and 
ever.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on 
their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,<BR>[<B>17</B>] Saying, 
We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; 
because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast 
reigned.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and 
the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give 
reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy 
name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the 
earth.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was 
seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and 
voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman 
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of 
twelve stars:<BR>[<B>2</B>] And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, 
and pained to be delivered.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And there appeared another wonder in 
heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and 
seven crowns upon his heads.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And his tail drew the third part of 
the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before 
the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it 
was born.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all 
nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his 
throne.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a 
place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred 
and threescore days.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And there was war in heaven: Michael and his 
angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his 
angels,<BR>[<B>8</B>] And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more 
in heaven.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, 
called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out 
into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And I 
heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and 
the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our 
brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and 
night.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the 
word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the 
death.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. 
Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down 
unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short 
time.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he 
persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And to 
the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the 
wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and 
half a time, from the face of the serpent.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And the serpent cast 
out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be 
carried away of the flood.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the earth helped the woman, and 
the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out 
of his mouth.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went 
to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, 
and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast 
rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten 
crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the beast 
which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, 
and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his 
seat, and great authority.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And I saw one of his heads as it were 
wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered 
after the beast.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And they worshipped the dragon which gave power 
unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the 
beast? who is able to make war with him?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And there was given unto 
him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him 
to continue forty and two months.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he opened his mouth in 
blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that 
dwell in heaven.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And it was given unto him to make war with the 
saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and 
tongues, and nations.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And all that dwell upon the earth shall 
worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain 
from the foundation of the world.<BR>[<B>9</B>] If any man have an ear, let him 
hear.<BR>[<B>10</B>] He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he 
that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience 
and the faith of the saints.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And I beheld another beast coming up 
out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a 
dragon.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before 
him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first 
beast, whose deadly wound was healed.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he doeth great wonders, 
so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of 
men,<BR>[<B>14</B>] And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of 
those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to 
them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which 
had the wound by a sword, and did live.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he had power to give 
life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, 
and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be 
killed.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, 
free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their 
foreheads:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had 
the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: 
for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and 
six.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, 
and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name 
written in their foreheads.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I heard a voice from heaven, as 
the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the 
voice of harpers harping with their harps:<BR>[<B>3</B>] And they sung as it 
were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: 
and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, 
which were redeemed from the earth.<BR>[<B>4</B>] These are they which were not 
defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb 
whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the 
firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And in their mouth was found 
no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And 
I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to 
preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and 
tongue, and people,<BR>[<B>7</B>] Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give 
glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made 
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great 
city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her 
fornication.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud 
voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his 
forehead, or in his hand,<BR>[<B>10</B>] The same shall drink of the wine of the 
wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his 
indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence 
of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the 
smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day 
nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark 
of his name.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Here is the patience of the saints: here are they 
that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And I 
heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die 
in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from 
their labours; and their works do follow them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And I looked, and 
behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, 
having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp 
sickle.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a 
loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the 
time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is 
ripe.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the 
earth; and the earth was reaped.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And another angel came out of 
the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And 
another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with 
a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, 
and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully 
ripe.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and 
gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the 
wrath of God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And the winepress was trodden without the city, and 
blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a 
thousand and six hundred furlongs.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I saw another sign in heaven, great and 
marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up 
the wrath of God.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with 
fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, 
and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, 
having the harps of God.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And they sing the song of Moses the 
servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy 
works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of 
saints.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for 
thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy 
judgments are made manifest.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And after that I looked, and, behold, 
the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was 
opened:<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the 
seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded 
with golden girdles.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And one of the four beasts gave unto the 
seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever 
and ever.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of 
God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the 
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to 
the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon 
the earth.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the 
earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the 
mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And 
the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of 
a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And the third 
angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they 
became blood.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art 
righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged 
thus.<BR>[<B>6</B>] For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and 
thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And I 
heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and 
righteous are thy judgments.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the fourth angel poured out his 
vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with 
fire.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the 
name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give 
him glory.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat 
of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their 
tongues for pain,<BR>[<B>11</B>] And blasphemed the God of heaven because of 
their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the 
water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be 
prepared.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of 
the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth 
of the false prophet.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For they are the spirits of devils, working 
miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to 
gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his 
garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he 
gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue 
Armageddon.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the 
air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, 
saying, It is done.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And there were voices, and thunders, and 
lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were 
upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the 
great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and 
great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the 
wine of the fierceness of his wrath.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And every island fled away, 
and the mountains were not found.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And there fell upon men a great 
hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed 
God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding 
great.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.17</H3>[<B>1</B>] And there came one of the seven angels which had the 
seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto 
thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many 
waters:<BR>[<B>2</B>] With whom the kings of the earth have committed 
fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine 
of her fornication.<BR>[<B>3</B>] So he carried me away in the spirit into the 
wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names 
of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And the woman was 
arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones 
and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness 
of her fornication:<BR>[<B>5</B>] And upon her forehead was a name written, 
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE 
EARTH.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, 
and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with 
great admiration.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou 
marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that 
carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.<BR>[<B>8</B>] The beast 
that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, 
and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose 
names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, 
when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And 
here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on 
which the woman sitteth.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And there are seven kings: five are 
fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must 
continue a short space.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the beast that was, and is not, even 
he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no 
kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the 
beast.<BR>[<B>13</B>] These have one mind, and shall give their power and 
strength unto the beast.<BR>[<B>14</B>] These shall make war with the Lamb, and 
the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and 
they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are 
peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the ten 
horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall 
make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with 
fire.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to 
agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be 
fulfilled.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, 
which reigneth over the kings of the earth.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.18</H3>[<B>1</B>] And after these things I saw another angel come down 
from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his 
glory.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon 
the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the 
hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful 
bird.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and 
the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
delicacies.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come 
out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive 
not of her plagues.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God 
hath remembered her iniquities.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Reward her even as she rewarded 
you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she 
hath filled fill to her double.<BR>[<B>7</B>] How much she hath glorified 
herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she 
saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no 
sorrow.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and 
mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is 
the Lord God who judgeth her.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the kings of the earth, who have 
committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and 
lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great 
city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment 
come.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over 
her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:<BR>[<B>12</B>] The 
merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine 
linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner 
vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, 
and iron, and marble,<BR>[<B>13</B>] And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, 
and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and 
sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things 
which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no 
more at all.<BR>[<B>15</B>] The merchants of these things, which were made rich 
by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and 
wailing,<BR>[<B>16</B>] And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was 
clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and 
precious stones, and pearls!<BR>[<B>17</B>] For in one hour so great riches is 
come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, 
and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,<BR>[<B>18</B>] And cried when they 
saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great 
city!<BR>[<B>19</B>] And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and 
wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that 
had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made 
desolate.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and 
prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And a mighty angel 
took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus 
with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found 
no more at all.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of 
pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, 
of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a 
millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;<BR>[<B>23</B>] And the light of 
a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and 
of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the 
great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations 
deceived.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of 
saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.19</H3>[<B>1</B>] And after these things I heard a great voice of much 
people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, 
unto the Lord our God:<BR>[<B>2</B>] For true and righteous are his judgments: 
for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her 
fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her 
hand.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for 
ever and ever.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts 
fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; 
Alleluia.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our 
God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and 
great.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and 
as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, 
Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Let us be glad and 
rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his 
wife hath made herself ready.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And to her was granted that she 
should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the 
righteousness of saints.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are 
they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto 
me, These are the true sayings of God.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And I fell at his feet to 
worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, 
and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the 
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And I saw heaven 
opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful 
and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.<BR>[<B>12</B>] His 
eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a 
name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he was 
clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of 
God.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white 
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And out of his 
mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he 
shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the 
fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he hath on his vesture 
and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF 
LORDS.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with 
a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and 
gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;<BR>[<B>18</B>] That 
ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of 
mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh 
of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And I saw 
the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to 
make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles 
before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, 
and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of 
fire burning with brimstone.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the remnant were slain with the 
sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: 
and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.20</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the 
key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he 
laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and 
bound him a thousand years,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And cast him into the bottomless pit, 
and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no 
more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be 
loosed a little season.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, 
and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded 
for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped 
the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their 
foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand 
years.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand 
years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Blessed and 
holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death 
hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign 
with him a thousand years.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when the thousand years are 
expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,<BR>[<B>8</B>] And shall go out 
to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and 
Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of 
the sea.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and 
compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down 
from God out of heaven, and devoured them.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the devil that 
deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and 
the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and 
ever.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, 
from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place 
for them.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; 
and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of 
life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the 
books, according to their works.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And the sea gave up the dead 
which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: 
and they were judged every man according to their works.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second 
death.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And whosoever was not found written in the book of life 
was cast into the lake of fire.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.21</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first 
heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more 
sea.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from 
God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is 
with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God 
himself shall be with them, and be their God.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And God shall wipe 
away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither 
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things 
are passed away.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I 
make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and 
faithful.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, 
the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain 
of the water of life freely.<BR>[<B>7</B>] He that overcometh shall inherit all 
things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But the 
fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, 
and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake 
which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of 
the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew 
thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he carried me away in the 
spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy 
Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,<BR>[<B>11</B>] Having the glory of 
God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper 
stone, clear as crystal;<BR>[<B>12</B>] And had a wall great and high, and had 
twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which 
are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:<BR>[<B>13</B>] On 
the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on 
the west three gates.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the wall of the city had twelve 
foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the 
Lamb.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the 
city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the city 
lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the 
city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the 
height of it are equal.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he measured the wall thereof, an 
hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, 
of the angel.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: 
and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the 
foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious 
stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a 
chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;<BR>[<B>20</B>] The fifth, sardonyx; the 
sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; 
the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an 
amethyst.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several 
gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were 
transparent glass.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God 
Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And the city had no 
need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did 
lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And the nations of 
them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth 
do bring their glory and honour into it.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And the gates of it 
shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night 
there.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations 
into it.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that 
defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they 
which are written in the Lamb's book of life.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rev.22</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear 
as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the 
tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every 
month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the 
nations.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God 
and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their 
foreheads.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And there shall be no night there; and they need no 
candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they 
shall reign for ever and ever.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he said unto me, These sayings 
are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to 
shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.<BR>[<B>7</B>] 
Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy 
of this book.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And I John saw these things, and heard them. And 
when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel 
which shewed me these things.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then saith he unto me, See thou do 
it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of 
them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he 
saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time 
is at hand.<BR>[<B>11</B>] He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he 
which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be 
righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And, 
behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as 
his work shall be.<BR>[<B>13</B>] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the 
end, the first and the last.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Blessed are they that do his 
commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in 
through the gates into the city.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For without are dogs, and 
sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth 
and maketh a lie.<BR>[<B>16</B>] I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto 
you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and 
the bright and morning star.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And the Spirit and the bride say, 
Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And 
whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For I 
testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If 
any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are 
written in this book:<BR>[<B>19</B>] And if any man shall take away from the 
words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book 
of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this 
book.<BR>[<B>20</B>] He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come 
quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.<BR>
