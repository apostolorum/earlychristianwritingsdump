<H1>The Gospel According to Saint John </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the beginning was the Word, and the 
Word was with God, and the Word was God. <A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same was in the beginning with God. 
<A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All things were made through him; and 
without him was not anything made that hath been made. <A name=C1V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In him was life; and 
the life was the light of men. <A name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the light shineth in the darkness; 
and the darkness apprehended it not. <A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There came a man, sent from God, whose 
name was John. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same came for witness, that he might 
bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him. <A 
name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
was not the light, but <I>came</I> that he might bear witness of the light. <A 
name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was the true light, <I>even the 
light</I> which lighteth every man, coming into the world. <A name=C1V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He was in the 
world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not. <A 
name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not. <A 
name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as many as received him, to them 
gave he the right to become children of God, <I>even</I> to them that believe on 
his name: <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who were born, not of blood, nor of the 
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <A name=C1V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Word became 
flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only 
begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth. <A name=C1V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John beareth 
witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh 
after me is become before me: for he was before me. <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For of his fulness 
we all received, and grace for grace. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the law was given through Moses; 
grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <A name=C1V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No man hath seen 
God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he 
hath declared <I>him</I>. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this is the witness of John, when 
the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art 
thou? <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he confessed, and denied not; and 
he confessed, I am not the Christ. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they asked him, What then? Art thou 
Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. <A 
name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore unto him, Who art 
thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of 
thyself? <A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said, I am the voice of one crying 
in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the 
prophet. <A name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they had been sent from the 
Pharisees. <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they asked him, and said unto him, 
Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the 
prophet? <A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John answered them, saying, I baptize 
in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not, <A name=C1V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>even</I> he that 
cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose. <A 
name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things were done in Bethany 
beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <A name=C1V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the morrow he 
seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh 
away the sin of the world! <A name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is he of whom I said, After me 
cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me. <A name=C1V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I knew him not; 
but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing 
in water. <A name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And John bare witness, saying, I have 
beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him. <A 
name=C1V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I knew him not: but he that sent me 
to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit 
descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy 
Spirit. <A name=C1V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I have seen, and have borne witness 
that this is the Son of God. <A name=C1V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again on the morrow John was standing, 
and two of his disciples; <A name=C1V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, 
and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God! <A name=C1V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the two disciples heard him speak, 
and they followed Jesus. <A name=C1V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus turned, and beheld them 
following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi 
(which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou? <A 
name=C1V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he 
abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. <A 
name=C1V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of the two that heard John 
<I>speak</I>, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. <A 
name=C1V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the 
Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). <A name=C1V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He brought him unto 
Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou 
shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter). <A name=C1V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the morrow he 
was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto 
him, Follow me. <A name=C1V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the 
city of Andrew and Peter. <A name=C1V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith 
unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, 
Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. <A name=C1V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Nathanael said unto him, Can any 
good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. <A 
name=C1V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and 
saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! <A 
name=C1V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence 
knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, 
when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. <A name=C1V49><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nathanael answered 
him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel. <A 
name=C1V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? 
thou shalt see greater things than these. <A name=C1V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto 
him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the 
angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. 
<P>
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the third day there was a marriage 
in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Jesus also was 
bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage. <A name=C2V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the wine 
failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. <A 
name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet 
come. <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His mother saith unto the servants, 
Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. <A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were six waterpots of stone 
set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins 
apiece. <A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the 
waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. <A name=C2V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto 
them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it. <A 
name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not 
whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the 
feast calleth the bridegroom, <A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saith unto him, Every man setteth 
on first the good wine; and when <I>men</I> have drunk freely, <I>then</I> that 
which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now. <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This beginning of 
his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his 
disciples believed on him. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After this he went down to Capernaum, 
he, and his mother, and <I>his</I> brethren, and his disciples; and there they 
abode not many days. <A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the passover of the Jews was at 
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he found in the temple those that 
sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: <A 
name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he made a scourge of cords, and 
cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the 
changers' money, and overthrew their tables; <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to them that 
sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a 
house of merchandise. <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His disciples remembered that it was 
written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up. <A name=C2V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore 
answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou 
doest these things? <A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. <A name=C2V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore 
said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up 
in three days? <A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he spake of the temple of his body. 
<A name=C2V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore he was raised from the 
dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the 
scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. <A name=C2V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when he was in 
Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, 
beholding his signs which he did. <A name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus did not trust himself unto 
them, for that he knew all men, <A name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and because he needed not that any one 
should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man. 
<P>
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, 
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: <A name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the same came unto him by night, and 
said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one 
can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him. <A name=C3V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and 
said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he 
cannot see the kingdom of God. <A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man 
be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and 
be born? <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say 
unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the 
kingdom of God! <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That which is born of the flesh is 
flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <A name=C3V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Marvel not that I 
said unto thee, Ye must be born anew. <A name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The wind bloweth where it will, and thou 
hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it 
goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. <A name=C3V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nicodemus answered 
and said unto him, How can these things be? <A name=C3V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and 
said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these 
things? <A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We 
speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye 
receive not our witness. <A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If I told you earthly things and ye 
believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? <A 
name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no one hath ascended into heaven, 
but he that descended out of heaven, <I>even</I> the Son of man, who is in 
heaven. <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in 
the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; <A name=C3V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that whosoever 
believeth may in him have eternal life. <A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For God so loved the world, that he 
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, 
but have eternal life. <A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For God sent not the Son into the world 
to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him. <A 
name=C3V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged 
already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of 
God. <A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this is the judgment, that the 
light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; 
for their works were evil. <A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For every one that doeth evil hateth 
the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved. <A 
name=C3V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he that doeth the truth cometh to 
the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in 
God. <A name=C3V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things came Jesus and his 
disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
<A name=C3V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And John also was baptizing in Enon 
near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were 
baptized. <A name=C3V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For John was not yet cast into prison. 
<A name=C3V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There arose therefore a questioning on 
the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. <A name=C3V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came unto 
John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom 
thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. <A 
name=C3V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John answered and said, A man can 
receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven. <A name=C3V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye yourselves bear 
me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him. <A 
name=C3V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that 
standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: 
this my joy therefore is made full. <A name=C3V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He must increase, but I must decrease. 
<A name=C3V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that cometh from above is above all: 
he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that 
cometh from heaven is above all. <A name=C3V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What he hath seen and heard, of that he 
beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness. <A name=C3V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that hath 
received his witness hath set his seal to <I>this</I>, that God is true. <A 
name=C3V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the 
words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure. <A name=C3V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Father loveth 
the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. <A name=C3V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that believeth 
on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see 
life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.

<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore the Lord knew that the 
Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 
<A name=C4V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(although Jesus himself baptized not, 
but his disciples), <A name=C4V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he left Judea, and departed again into 
Galilee. <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he must needs pass through Samaria. 
<A name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he cometh to a city of Samaria, 
called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph: 
<A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Jacob's well was there. Jesus 
therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about 
the sixth hour. <A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw 
water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. <A name=C4V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For his disciples 
were gone away into the city to buy food. <A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto 
him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan 
woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) <A name=C4V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and 
said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to 
thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given 
thee living water. <A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou 
hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that 
living water? <A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, 
who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 
<A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto her, Every 
one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: <A name=C4V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but whosoever 
drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water 
that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto 
eternal life. <A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me 
this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw. <A 
name=C4V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy 
husband, and come hither. <A name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman answered and said unto him, I 
have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: <A 
name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for thou hast had five husbands; and he 
whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. <A 
name=C4V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I 
perceive that thou art a prophet. <A name=C4V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Our fathers worshipped in this 
mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
<A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe 
me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye 
worship the Father. <A name=C4V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye worship that which ye know not: we 
worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. <A name=C4V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the hour 
cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit 
and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. <A 
name=C4V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God is a Spirit: and they that worship 
him must worship in spirit and truth. <A name=C4V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman saith unto him, I know that 
Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto 
us all things. <A name=C4V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto 
thee am <I>he</I>. <A name=C4V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And upon this came his disciples; and 
they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest 
thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? <A name=C4V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the woman left her waterpot, and 
went away into the city, and saith to the people, <A name=C4V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Come, see a man, 
who told me all things that <I>ever</I> I did: can this be the Christ? <A 
name=C4V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They went out of the city, and were 
coming to him. <A name=C4V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the mean while the disciples prayed 
him, saying, Rabbi, eat. <A name=C4V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said unto them, I have meat to 
eat that ye know not. <A name=C4V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples therefore said one to 
another, Hath any man brought him <I>aught</I> to eat? <A name=C4V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto 
them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work. 
<A name=C4V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Say not ye, There are yet four months, 
and <I>then</I> cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, 
and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest. <A 
name=C4V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he 
that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. <A name=C4V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For herein is the 
saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. <A name=C4V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I sent you to reap 
that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into 
their labor. <A name=C4V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And from that city many of the 
Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He 
told me all things that <I>ever</I> I did. <A name=C4V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when the 
Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode 
there two days. <A name=C4V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And many more believed because of his 
word; <A name=C4V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they said to the woman, Now we 
believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know 
that this is indeed the Saviour of the world. <A name=C4V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after the two 
days he went forth from thence into Galilee. <A name=C4V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Jesus himself 
testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. <A name=C4V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when he came 
into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he 
did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. <A 
name=C4V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And 
there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. <A 
name=C4V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he heard that Jesus was come out 
of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought <I>him</I> that he would 
come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. <A 
name=C4V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said unto him, Except 
ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. <A name=C4V49><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The nobleman saith 
unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. <A name=C4V50><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto 
him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto 
him, and he went his way. <A name=C4V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he was now going down, his 
servants met him, saying, that his son lived. <A name=C4V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he inquired of 
them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at 
the seventh hour the fever left him. <A name=C4V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the father knew that <I>it was</I> 
at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, 
and his whole house. <A name=C4V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is again the second sign that 
Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things there was a feast of 
the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep 
<I>gate</I> a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches. <A 
name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In 
these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, <I>waiting 
for the moving of the water.</I> <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>for an angel of the Lord went down at 
certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first 
after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever 
disease he was holden.</I> <A name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain man was there, who had 
been thirty and eight years in his infirmity. <A name=C5V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus saw him 
lying, and knew that he had been now a long time <I>in that case</I>, he saith 
unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole? <A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sick man answered him, Sir, I have 
no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am 
coming, another steppeth down before me. <A name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy 
bed, and walk. <A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the man was made whole, 
and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day. <A 
name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So 
the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful 
for thee to take up thy bed. <A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he answered them, He that made me 
whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. <A name=C5V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They asked him, Who 
is the man that said unto thee, Take up <I>thy bed</I>, and walk? <A 
name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he that was healed knew not who it 
was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place. <A 
name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the 
temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a 
worse thing befall thee. <A name=C5V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The man went away, and told the Jews 
that it was Jesus who had made him whole. <A name=C5V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And for this cause 
the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath. <A 
name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus answered them, My Father 
worketh even until now, and I work. <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause therefore the Jews 
sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also 
called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <A name=C5V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do 
nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever 
he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. <A name=C5V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Father 
loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works 
than these will he show him, that ye may marvel. <A name=C5V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as the Father 
raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom 
he will. <A name=C5V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For neither doth the Father judge any 
man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son; <A name=C5V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that all may honor 
the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth 
not the Father that sent him. <A name=C5V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that 
heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh 
not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life. <A name=C5V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of 
the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. <A name=C5V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as the Father 
hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself: 
<A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he gave him authority to execute 
judgment, because he is a son of man. <A name=C5V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Marvel not at this: for the hour 
cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, <A 
name=C5V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and shall come forth; they that have 
done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the 
resurrection of judgment. <A name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, 
I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the 
will of him that sent me. <A name=C5V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If I bear witness of myself, my witness 
is not true. <A name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is another that beareth witness of 
me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. <A 
name=C5V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye 
have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth. <A 
name=C5V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the witness which I receive is not 
from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved. <A name=C5V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He was the lamp 
that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his 
light. <A name=C5V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the witness which I have is greater 
than <I>that of</I> John; for the works which the Father hath given me to 
accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath 
sent me. <A name=C5V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Father that sent me, he hath 
borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his 
form. <A name=C5V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ye have not his word abiding in 
you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. <A name=C5V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye search the 
scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are 
they which bear witness of me; <A name=C5V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and ye will not come to me, that ye may 
have life. <A name=C5V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>5:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am come in my Father's name, and ye 
receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. <A 
name=C5V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How can ye believe, who receive glory 
one of another, and the glory that <I>cometh</I> from the only God ye seek not? 
<A name=C5V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Think not that I will accuse you to the 
Father: there is one that accuseth you, <I>even</I> Moses, on whom ye have set 
your hope. <A name=C5V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if ye believed Moses, ye would 
believe me; for he wrote of me. <A name=C5V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

shall ye believe my words?

<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is <I>the sea</I> of Tiberias. <A 
name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on 
them that were sick. <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus went up into the mountain, and 
there he sat with his disciples. <A name=C6V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, 
was at hand. <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and 
seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we 
to buy bread, that these may eat? <A name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this he said to prove him: for he 
himself knew what he would do. <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Philip answered him, Two hundred 
shillings' worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a 
little. <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon 
Peter's brother, saith unto him, <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There is a lad here, who hath five 
barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many? <A 
name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said, Make the people sit down. 
Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five 
thousand. <A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore took the loaves; and 
having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of 
the fishes as much as they would. <A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were filled, he saith 
unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing 
be lost. <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they gathered them up, and filled 
twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained 
over unto them that had eaten. <A name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore the people saw the sign 
which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the 
world. <A name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore perceiving that they 
were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into 
the mountain himself alone. <A name=C6V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when evening came, his disciples 
went down unto the sea; <A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they entered into a boat, and were 
going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet 
come to them. <A name=C6V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the sea was rising by reason of a 
great wind that blew. <A name=C6V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore they had rowed about 
five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and 
drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid. <A name=C6V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he saith unto 
them, It is I; be not afraid. <A name=C6V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were willing therefore to receive 
him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were 
going. <A name=C6V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the morrow the multitude that stood 
on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, 
and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but <I>that</I> his 
disciples went away alone <A name=C6V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias 
nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks): 
<A name=C6V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>when the multitude therefore saw that 
Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, 
and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. <A name=C6V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they found him on the other 
side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? <A 
name=C6V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, 
verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate 
of the loaves, and were filled. <A name=C6V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Work not for the food which perisheth, 
but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall 
give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed. <A name=C6V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore 
unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God? <A 
name=C6V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto them, This 
is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. <A 
name=C6V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore unto him, What then 
doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou? <A 
name=C6V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Our fathers ate the manna in the 
wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. <A 
name=C6V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, 
verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; 
but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. <A name=C6V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the bread of 
God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world. <A

evermore give us this bread. <A name=C6V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall 
never thirst. <A name=C6V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I said unto you, that ye have seen 
me, and yet believe not. <A name=C6V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All that which the Father giveth me 
shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. <A 
name=C6V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I am come down from heaven, not to 
do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. <A name=C6V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this is the 
will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose 
nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. <A name=C6V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this is the 
will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, 
should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. <A 
name=C6V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore murmured concerning 
him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. <A 
name=C6V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the

down out of heaven? <A name=C6V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Murmur not among yourselves. <A name=C6V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No man can come to me, except the 
Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day. <A 
name=C6V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It 
is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that 
hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. <A 
name=C6V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not that any man hath seen the Father, 
save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father. <A name=C6V47><FONT

say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life. <A name=C6V48><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am the bread of 
life. <A name=C6V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Your fathers ate the manna in the 
wilderness, and they died. <A name=C6V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is the bread which cometh down out 
of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. <A name=C6V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am the living 
bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live 
for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the 
world. <A name=C6V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore strove one with 
another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? <A name=C6V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the 
Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves. <A 
name=C6V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life: and I will raise 
him up at the last day. <A name=C6V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>6:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As the living Father sent me, and I 
live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of 
me. <A name=C6V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is the bread which came down out 
of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall 
live for ever. <A name=C6V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things said he in the synagogue, 
as he taught in Capernaum. <A name=C6V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many therefore of his disciples, when 
the heard <I>this</I>, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? <A 
name=C6V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus knowing in himself that his 
disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble? <A

size=-1><SUP>6:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>What</I> then if ye should behold 
the Son of man ascending where he was before? <A name=C6V63><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is the spirit 
that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto 
you are spirit, are are life. <A name=C6V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there are some of you that believe 
not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who 
it was that should betray him. <A name=C6V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, For this cause have I said 
unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the 
Father. <A name=C6V66><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Upon this many of his disciples went 
back, and walked no more with him. <A name=C6V67><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, 
Would ye also go away? <A name=C6V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:68</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom 
shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. <A name=C6V69><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:69</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we have 
believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God. <A name=C6V70><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered 
them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? <A 
name=C6V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he spake of Judas <I>the son</I> of 
Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, <I>being</I> one of the 
twelve. 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these things Jesus walked in 
Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
<A name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of 
tabernacles, was at hand. <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His brethren therefore said unto him, 
Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works 
which thou doest. <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For no man doeth anything in secret, and 
himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself 
to the world. <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For even his brethren did not believe on 
him. <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time 
is not yet come; but your time is always ready. <A name=C7V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The world cannot 
hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. <A 
name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Go 
ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet 
fulfilled. <A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And having said these things unto them, 
he abode <I>still</I> in Galilee. <A name=C7V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when his brethren were gone up unto 
the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. <A 
name=C7V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore sought him at the 
feast, and said, Where is he? <A name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was much murmuring among the 
multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but 
he leadeth the multitude astray. <A name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yet no man spake openly of him for fear 
of the Jews. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when it was now the midst of the 
feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. <A name=C7V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore 
marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? <A 
name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore answered them and said, 
My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. <A name=C7V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If any man willeth 
to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or 
<I>whether</I> I speak from myself. <A name=C7V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that speaketh from himself seeketh 
his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is 
true, and no unrighteousness is in him. <A name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Did not Moses give you the law, and 
<I>yet</I> none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me? <A 
name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude answered, Thou hast a 
demon: who seeketh to kill thee? <A name=C7V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto them, I 
did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof. <A name=C7V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moses hath given 
you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the 
sabbath ye circumcise a man. <A name=C7V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If a man receiveth circumcision on the 
sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because 
I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath? <A name=C7V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Judge not according 
to appearance, but judge righteous judgment. <A name=C7V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some therefore of 
them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? <A 
name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And lo, he speaketh openly, and they 
say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the 
Christ? <A name=C7V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: 
but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. <A name=C7V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; 
and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. <A 
name=C7V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
know him; because I am from him, and he sent me. <A name=C7V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They sought 
therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not 
yet come. <A name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But of the multitude many believed on 
him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those 
which this man hath done? <A name=C7V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees heard the multitude 
murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees 
sent officers to take him. <A name=C7V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said, Yet a little 
while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me. <A name=C7V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye shall seek me, 
and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come. <A name=C7V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore 
said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will 
he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <A 
name=C7V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What is this word that he said, Ye 
shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come? <A 
name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the last day, the great 
<I>day</I> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let 
him come unto me and drink. <A name=C7V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that believeth on me, as the 
scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water. <A 
name=C7V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this spake he of the Spirit, which 
they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet 
<I>given</I>; because Jesus was not yet glorified. <A name=C7V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>Some</I> of the 
multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the 
prophet. <A name=C7V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Others said, This is the Christ. But 
some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee? <A name=C7V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Hath not the 
scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, 
the village where David was? <A name=C7V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So there arose a division in the 
multitude because of him. <A name=C7V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some of them would have taken him; 
but no man laid hands on him. <A name=C7V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The officers therefore came to the 
chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him? 
<A name=C7V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The officers answered, Never man so 
spake. <A name=C7V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees therefore answered them, 
Are ye also led astray? <A name=C7V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Hath any of the rulers believed on him, 
or of the Pharisees? <A name=C7V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this multitude that knoweth not the 
law are accursed. <A name=C7V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came 
to him before, being one of them), <A name=C7V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Doth our law judge a man, except it 
first hear from himself and know what he doeth? <A name=C7V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered and 
said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee 
ariseth no prophet. 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went every man unto his own 
house: 
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
<A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And early in the morning he came again 
into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught 
them. <A name=C8V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribes and the Pharisees bring 
a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, <A name=C8V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they say unto him, 
Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act. <A 
name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now 
in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her? <A 
name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
this they said, trying him, that they might have <I>whereof</I> to accuse him. 
But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. <A 
name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He 
that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. <A 
name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. <A 
name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, 
<I>even</I> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she 
was, in the midst. <A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus lifted up himself, and said 
unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee? <A name=C8V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she said, No 
man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from 
henceforth sin no more. <A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, 
saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the 
darkness, but shall have the light of life. <A name=C8V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees 
therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not 
true. <A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto them, Even 
if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and 
whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. <A 
name=C8V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye 
judge after the flesh; I judge no man. <A name=C8V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yea and if I judge, my judgment is 
true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. <A name=C8V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yea and in your law 
it is written, that the witness of two men is true. <A name=C8V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am he that 
beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. <A 
name=C8V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore unto him, Where is 
thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye 
would know my Father also. <A name=C8V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These words spake he in the treasury, 
as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet 
come. <A name=C8V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said therefore again unto them, I go 
away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot 
come. <A name=C8V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill 
himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come? <A name=C8V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of 
this world. <A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I said therefore unto you, that ye 
shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am <I>he</I>, ye shall die 
in your sins. <A name=C8V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore unto him, Who art 
thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the 
beginning. <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I have many things to speak and to 
judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I 
heard from him, these speak I unto the world. <A name=C8V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They perceived not 
that he spake to them of the Father. <A name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said, When ye have 
lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <I>he</I>, and 
<I>that</I> I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these 
things. <A name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that sent me is with me; he hath 
not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him. <A 
name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
he spake these things, many believed on him. <A name=C8V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, <I>then</I> 
are ye truly my disciples; <A name=C8V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and ye shall know the truth, and the 
truth shall make you free. <A name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered unto him, We are 
Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, 
Ye shall be made free? <A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin. <A 
name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the bondservant abideth not in the 
house for ever: the son abideth for ever. <A name=C8V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore the 
Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. <A name=C8V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know that ye are 
Abraham's seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in 
you. <A name=C8V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I speak the things which I have seen 
with <I>my</I> Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from <I>your</I> 
father. <A name=C8V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered and said unto him, Our 
father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye 
would do the works of Abraham. <A name=C8V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that 
hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham. <A 
name=C8V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye 
do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of 
fornication; we have one Father, <I>even</I> God. <A name=C8V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto 
them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come 
from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. <A name=C8V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why do ye not 
understand my speech? <I>Even</I> because ye cannot hear my word. <A 
name=C8V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye 
are of <I>your</I> father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your 
will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, 
because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his 
own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. <A name=C8V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But because I say 
the truth, ye believe me not. <A name=C8V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I 
say truth, why do ye not believe me? <A name=C8V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that is of God heareth the words of 
God: for this cause ye hear <I>them</I> not, because ye are not of God. <A 
name=C8V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews answered and said unto him, 
Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon? <A name=C8V49><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, I 
have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me. <A name=C8V50><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I seek not mine 
own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. <A name=C8V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. <A 
name=C8V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews said unto him, Now we know 
that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a 
man keep my word, he shall never taste of death. <A name=C8V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Art thou greater 
than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou 
thyself? <A name=C8V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my 
glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is 
your God; <A name=C8V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and ye have not known him: but I know 
him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but 
I know him, and keep his word. <A name=C8V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my 
day; and he saw it, and was glad. <A name=C8V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou 
art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? <A name=C8V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto 
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am. <A 
name=C8V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They took up stones therefore to cast 
at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple. 
<P>
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he passed by, he saw a man blind 
from his birth. <A name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his disciples asked him, saying, 
Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? <A 
name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, Neither did this man 
sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
<A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We must work the works of him that sent 
me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. <A name=C9V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I am in the 
world, I am the light of the world. <A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the 
ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, <A 
name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, 
Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The neighbors 
therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not 
this he that sat and begged? <A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Others said, It is he: others said, No, 
but he is like him. He said, I am <I>he</I>. <A name=C9V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore 
unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? <A name=C9V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He answered, The 
man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go 
to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. <A 
name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto him, Where is he? He 
saith, I know not. <A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They bring to the Pharisees him that 
aforetime was blind. <A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it was the sabbath on the day when 
Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. <A name=C9V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again therefore the 
Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He 
put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. <A name=C9V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some therefore of 
the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the 
sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And 
there was division among them. <A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is 
a prophet. <A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore did not believe 
concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they 
called the parents of him that had received his sight, <A name=C9V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and asked them, 
saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see? 
<A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His parents answered and said, We know 
that this is our son, and that he was born blind: <A name=C9V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but how he now 
seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; 
he shall speak for himself. <A name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things said his parents, because 
they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should 
confess him <I>to be</I> Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. <A 
name=C9V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore said his parents, He is of 
age; ask him. <A name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they called a second time the man 
that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a 
sinner. <A name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He therefore answered, Whether he is a 
sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <A 
name=C9V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore unto him, What did 
he to thee? How opened he thine eyes? <A name=C9V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He answered them, I told you even now, 
and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his 
disciples? <A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they reviled him, and said, Thou 
art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. <A name=C9V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We know that God 
hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. <A 
name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The man answered and said unto them, 
Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and <I>yet</I> he 
opened mine eyes. <A name=C9V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We know that God heareth not sinners: 
but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. <A 
name=C9V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Since the world began it was never 
heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. <A name=C9V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If this man were 
not from God, he could do nothing. <A name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered and said unto him, Thou 
wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. <A 
name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; 
and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? <A 
name=C9V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? <A 
name=C9V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both 
seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. <A name=C9V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Lord, 
I believe. And he worshipped him. <A name=C9V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said, For judgment came I 
into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may 
become blind. <A name=C9V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Those of the Pharisees who were with 
him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? <A 
name=C9V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, 
ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.

Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha. <A name=C11V2><FONT

Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, 
whose brother Lazarus was sick. <A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. <A name=C11V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Jesus 
heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, 
that the Son of God may be glorified thereby. <A name=C11V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Jesus loved 
Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <A name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? <A

the light of this world. <A name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

stumbleth, because the light is not in him. <A name=C11V11><FONT

he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but 
I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. <A name=C11V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples 
therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover. <A

they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep. <A name=C11V14><FONT

therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <A name=C11V15><FONT

your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let 
us go unto him. <A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him. <A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

had been in the tomb four days already. <A name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. <A name=C11V20><FONT

when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in 
the house. <A name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <A name=C11V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And even now I 
know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. <A

shall rise again. <A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. <A name=C11V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said unto 
her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he 
die, yet shall he live; <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and whosoever liveth and believeth on 
me shall never die. Believest thou this? <A name=C11V27><FONT

him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, 
<I>even</I> he that cometh into the world. <A name=C11V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when she had 
said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The 
Teacher is her, and calleth thee. <A name=C11V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she, when she heard it, arose 
quickly, and went unto him. <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.) <A name=C11V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews then who 
were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she 
rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto 
the tomb to weep there. <A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary therefore, when she came where 
Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou 
hadst been here, my brother had not died. <A name=C11V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus 
therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews <I>also</I> weeping who came with her, 
he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, <A name=C11V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, Where 
have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. <A name=C11V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus wept. <A 
name=C11V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

loved him! <A name=C11V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of them said, Could not this 
man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also 
should not die? <A name=C11V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore again groaning in 
himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <A 
name=C11V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. 
Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the 
body decayeth; for he hath been <I>dead</I> four days. <A name=C11V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto 
her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the 
glory of God? <A name=C11V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. <A

always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they 
may believe that thou didst send me. <A name=C11V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had thus spoken, he cried 
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. <A name=C11V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that was dead came forth, bound 
hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. 
Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. <A name=C11V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many therefore of 
the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him. <A

size=-1><SUP>11:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of them went away to the 
Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. <A name=C11V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests 
therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this 
man doeth many signs. <A name=C11V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If we let him thus alone, all men will 
believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our 
nation. <A name=C11V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, 
being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, <A 
name=C11V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>nor do ye take account that it is 
expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole 
nation perish not. <A name=C11V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this he said not of himself: but, 
being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation; 
<A name=C11V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and not for the nation only, but that 
he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered 
abroad. <A name=C11V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So from that day forth they took 
counsel that they might put him to death. <A name=C11V54><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near 
to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the 
disciples. <A name=C11V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the passover of the Jews was at 
hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to 
purify themselves. <A name=C11V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They sought therefore for Jesus, and 
spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will 
not come to the feast? <A name=C11V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests and the 
Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should 
show it, that they might take him. 
<P>
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore six days before the 
passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. <A 
name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So 
they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them 
that sat at meat with him. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment 
of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet 
with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. <A 
name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Judas Iscariot, one of his 
disciples, that should betray him, saith, <A name=C12V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why was not this 
ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor? <A 
name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this he said, not because he cared 
for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was 
put therein. <A name=C12V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to 
keep it against the day of my burying. <A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the poor ye have always with you; 
but me ye have not always. <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The common people therefore of the Jews 
learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that 
they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. <A 
name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the chief priests took counsel 
that they might put Lazarus also to death; <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because that by 
reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. <A 
name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On the morrow a great multitude that 
had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <A 
name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>took the branches of the palm trees, 
and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed <I>is</I> he that 
cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. <A name=C12V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus, having 
found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, <A name=C12V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Fear not, daughter 
of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. <A name=C12V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things 
understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then 
remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done 
these things unto him. <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude therefore that was with 
him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare 
witness. <A name=C12V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause also the multitude went 
and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. <A 
name=C12V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees therefore said among 
themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him. <A 
name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were certain Greeks among 
those that went up to worship at the feast: <A name=C12V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>these therefore 
came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we 
would see Jesus. <A name=C12V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: 
Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus. <A name=C12V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus 
answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be 
glorified. <A name=C12V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except 
a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if 
it die, it beareth much fruit. <A name=C12V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that loveth his life loseth it; and 
he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. <A 
name=C12V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If any man serve me, let him follow 
me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him 
will the Father honor. <A name=C12V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now is my soul troubled; and what 
shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this 
hour. <A name=C12V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Father, glorify thy name. There came 
therefore a voice out of heaven, <I>saying</I>, I have both glorified it, and 
will glorify it again. <A name=C12V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude therefore, that stood 
by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken 
to him. <A name=C12V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said, This voice 
hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes. <A name=C12V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now is the 
judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. <A 
name=C12V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I, if I be lifted up from the 
earth, will draw all men unto myself. <A name=C12V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this he said, signifying by what 
manner of death he should die. <A name=C12V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude therefore answered him, 
We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest 
thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? <A 
name=C12V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a 
little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness 
overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he 
goeth. <A name=C12V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While ye have the light, believe on 
the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he 
departed and hid himself from them. <A name=C12V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But though he had done so many signs 
before them, yet they believed not on him: <A name=C12V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that the word of 
Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, 
<P>&nbsp;Lord, who hath believed our report? 
<P>&nbsp;And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
<P><A name=C12V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause they could not believe, 
for that Isaiah said again, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C12V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He hath blinded their eyes, and he 
hardened their heart; 
<P>&nbsp;Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, 
<P>&nbsp;And should turn, 
<P>&nbsp;And I should heal them. 
<P><A name=C12V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things said Isaiah, because he 
saw his glory; and he spake of him. <A name=C12V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nevertheless even of the rulers many 
believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <I>it</I>, 
lest they should be put out of the synagogue: <A name=C12V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they loved the 
glory <I>that is</I> of men more than the glory <I>that is</I> of God. <A 
name=C12V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus cried and said, He that 
believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. <A 
name=C12V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him 
that sent me. <A name=C12V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am come a light into the world, that 
whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness. <A name=C12V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if any man 
hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the 
world, but to save the world. <A name=C12V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth 
not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall 
judge him in the last day. <A name=C12V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I spake not from myself; but the 
Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what 
I should speak. <A name=C12V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I know that his commandment is 
life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said 
unto me, so I speak. 
<P>
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now before the feast of the passover, 
Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world 
unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto 
the end. <A name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And during supper, the devil having 
already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <I>son</I>, to betray him, 
<A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>Jesus</I>, knowing that the Father 
had given all the things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and 
goeth unto God, <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>riseth from supper, and layeth aside 
his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself. <A name=C13V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then he poureth 
water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them 
with the towel wherewith he was girded. <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith 
unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? <A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered and said unto him, What 
I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter. <A 
name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never 
wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
<A name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not 
my feet only, but also my hands and my head. <A name=C13V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith to 
him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every 
whit: and ye are clean, but not all. <A name=C13V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he knew him that should betray 
him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. <A name=C13V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when he had 
washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto 
them, Know ye what I have done to you? <A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye 
say well; for so I am. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, 
have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. <A 
name=C13V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I have given you an example, that 
ye also should do as I have done to you. <A name=C13V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent 
greater than he that sent him. <A name=C13V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If ye know these things, blessed are 
ye if ye do them. <A name=C13V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I speak not of you all: I know whom I 
have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my bread 
lifted up his heel against me. <A name=C13V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From henceforth I tell you before it 
come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am <I>he</I>. 
<A name=C13V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I say unto you, he 
that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me 
receiveth him that sent me. <A name=C13V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus had thus said, he was 
troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, 
that one of you shall betray me. <A name=C13V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciples looked one on another, 
doubting of whom he spake. <A name=C13V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was at the table reclining in 
Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. <A name=C13V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter 
therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell <I>us</I> who it is of whom 
he speaketh. <A name=C13V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' 
breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? <A name=C13V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, 
for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he 
taketh and giveth it to Judas, <I>the son</I> of Simon Iscariot. <A 
name=C13V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after the sop, then entered Satan 
into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly. <A 
name=C13V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now no man at the table knew for what 
intent he spake this unto him. <A name=C13V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For some thought, because Judas had 
the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the 
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. <A name=C13V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He then having 
received the sop went out straightway: and it was night. <A name=C13V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore he 
was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified 
in him; <A name=C13V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and God shall glorify him in himself, 
and straightway shall he glorify him. <A name=C13V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye 
cannot come; so now I say unto you. <A name=C13V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one 
another. <A name=C13V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

my disciples, if ye have love one to another. <A name=C13V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter saith 
unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not 
follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards. <A name=C13V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter saith unto 
him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee. 
<A name=C13V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down 
thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till 
thou hast denied me thrice.

<P><A name=C18V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus had spoken these words, he 
went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into 
which he entered, himself and his disciples. <A name=C18V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Judas also, who 
betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his 
disciples. <A name=C18V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Judas then, having received the band 
<I>of soldiers</I>, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, 
cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. <A name=C18V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore, 
knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto 
them, Whom seek ye? <A name=C18V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. 
Jesus saith unto them, I am <I>he</I>. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was 
standing with them. <A name=C18V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore he said unto them, I am 
<I>he</I>, they went backward, and fell to the ground. <A name=C18V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again therefore he 
asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. <A name=C18V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, I 
told you that I am <I>he</I>; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: 
<A name=C18V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that the word might be fulfilled which 
he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one. <A name=C18V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter 
therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut 
off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus. <A name=C18V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore 
said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath 
given me, shall I not drink it? <A name=C18V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the band and the chief captain, and 
the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, <A name=C18V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and led him to 
Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that 
year. <A name=C18V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel 
to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. <A 
name=C18V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and 
<I>so did</I> another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high 
priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; <A 
name=C18V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Peter was standing at the door 
without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and 
spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. <A name=C18V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The maid therefore 
that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also <I>one</I> of this man's 
disciples? He saith, I am not. <A name=C18V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the servants and the officers were 
standing <I>there</I>, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they 
were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming 
himself. <A name=C18V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The high priest therefore asked Jesus 
of his disciples, and of his teaching. <A name=C18V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered him, I have spoken 
openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all 
the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing. <A name=C18V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why askest thou 
me? Ask them that have heard <I>me</I>, what I spake unto them: behold, these 
know the things which I said. <A name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had said this, one of the 
officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high 
priest so? <A name=C18V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken 
evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? <A 
name=C18V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Annas therefore sent him bound unto 
Caiaphas the high priest. <A name=C18V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Simon Peter was standing and 
warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also <I>one</I> of his 
disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. <A name=C18V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of the 
servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, 
saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? <A name=C18V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter therefore 
denied again: and straightway the cock crew. <A name=C18V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They lead Jesus 
therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they 
themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but 
might eat the passover. <A name=C18V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore went out unto them, 
and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man? <A name=C18V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They answered and 
said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered 
him up unto thee. <A name=C18V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore said unto them, Take 
him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It 
is not lawful for us to put any man to death: <A name=C18V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that the word of 
Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he 
should die. <A name=C18V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore entered again into 
the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the 
Jews? <A name=C18V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of 
thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me? <A name=C18V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate answered, 
Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what 
hast thou done? <A name=C18V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of 
this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that 
I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. <A 
name=C18V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art 
thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have 
I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear 
witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. <A 
name=C18V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? 
And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, 
I find no crime in him. <A name=C18V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But ye have a custom, that I should 
release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you 
the King of the Jews? <A name=C18V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They cried out therefore again, 
saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.) 
<P>
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and 
scourged him. <A name=C19V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the soldiers platted a crown of 
thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment; <A 
name=C19V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they came unto him, and said, Hail, 
King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands. <A name=C19V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate went out 
again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know 
that I find no crime in him. <A name=C19V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore came out, wearing the 
crown of thorns and the purple garment. And <I>Pilate</I> saith unto them, 
Behold, the man! <A name=C19V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore the chief priests and 
the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify <I>him</I>, crucify 
<I>him</I>! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I 
find no crime in him. <A name=C19V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews answered him, We have a law, 
and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <A 
name=C19V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Pilate therefore heard this 
saying, he was the more afraid; <A name=C19V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he entered into the Praetorium 
again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. <A 
name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate therefore saith unto him, 
Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, 
and have power to crucify thee? <A name=C19V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have 
no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that 
delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. <A name=C19V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Upon this Pilate 
sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, 
thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh 
against Caesar. <A name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Pilate therefore heard these 
words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called 
The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. <A name=C19V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it was the Preparation of the 
passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your 
King! <A name=C19V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore cried out, Away with 
<I>him</I>, away with <I>him</I>, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I 
crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. <A 
name=C19V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then therefore he delivered him unto 
them to be crucified. <A name=C19V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They took Jesus therefore: and he went 
out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, 
which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha: <A name=C19V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>where they crucified him, and with him 
two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. <A name=C19V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate wrote a 
title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, 
THE KING OF THE JEWS. <A name=C19V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This title therefore read many of the 
Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was 
written in Hebrew, <I>and</I> in Latin, <I>and</I> in Greek. <A 
name=C19V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests of the Jews 
therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I 
am King of the Jews. <A name=C19V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate answered, What I have written I 
have written. <A name=C19V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The soldiers therefore, when they had 
crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; 
and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
<A name=C19V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They said therefore one to another, 
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture 
might be fulfilled, which saith, 
<P>&nbsp;They parted my garments among them, 
<P>&nbsp;And upon my vesture did they cast lots. 
<P><A name=C19V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These things therefore the soldiers 
did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's 
sister, Mary the <I>wife</I> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <A name=C19V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus 
therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith 
unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! <A name=C19V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, 
thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own <I>home</I>. 
<A name=C19V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After this Jesus, knowing that all 
things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I 
thirst. <A name=C19V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was set there a vessel full of 
vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to 
his mouth. <A name=C19V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus therefore had received the 
vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit. 
<A name=C19V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Jews therefore, because it was the 
Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath 
(for the day of that sabbath was a high <I>day</I>), asked of Pilate that their 
legs might be broken, and <I>that</I> they might be taken away. <A 
name=C19V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The soldiers therefore came, and brake 
the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him: <A 
name=C19V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but when they came to Jesus, and saw 
that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: <A name=C19V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>howbeit one of the 
soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and 
water. <A name=C19V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that hath seen hath borne 
witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye 
also may believe. <A name=C19V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For these things came to pass, that 
the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. <A 
name=C19V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again another scripture saith, 
They shall look on him whom they pierced. <A name=C19V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these 
things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of 
the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate 
gave <I>him</I> leave. He came therefore, and took away his body. <A 
name=C19V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came also Nicodemus, he who 
at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 
a hundred pounds. <A name=C19V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they took the body of Jesus, and 
bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. 
<A name=C19V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the place where he was 
crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man 
yet laid. <A name=C19V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There then because of the Jews' 
Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus. 
<P>
<P><A name=C20V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the first <I>day</I> of the week 
cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the 
stone taken away from the tomb. <A name=C20V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She runneth therefore, and cometh to 
Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, 
They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have 
laid him. <A name=C20V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter therefore went forth, and the 
other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. <A name=C20V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they ran both 
together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb; <A 
name=C20V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and stooping and looking in, he seeth 
the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in. <A name=C20V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter 
therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he 
beholdeth the linen cloths lying, <A name=C20V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the napkin, that was upon his head, 
not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. <A 
name=C20V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then entered in therefore the other 
disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. <A 
name=C20V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as yet they knew not the scripture, 
that he must rise from the dead. <A name=C20V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the disciples went away again unto 
their own home. <A name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Mary was standing without at the 
tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; <A 
name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and she beholdeth two angels in white 
sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they say unto her, Woman, why 
weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I 
know not where they have laid him. <A name=C20V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When she had thus said, she turned 
herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. <A 
name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why 
weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith 
unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, 
and I will take him away. <A name=C20V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She 
turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, 
Teacher. <A name=C20V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for 
I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, 
I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God. <A 
name=C20V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the 
disciples, I have seen the Lord; and <I>that</I> he had said these things unto 
her. <A name=C20V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore it was evening, on that 
day, the first <I>day</I> of the week, and when the doors were shut where the 
disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and 
saith unto them, Peace <I>be</I> unto you. <A name=C20V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had 
said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore 
were glad, when they saw the Lord. <A name=C20V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore said to them again, 
Peace <I>be</I> unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. <A 
name=C20V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had said this, he breathed 
on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit: <A name=C20V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whose soever sins 
ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever <I>sins</I> ye retain, 
they are retained. <A name=C20V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called 
Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <A name=C20V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The other 
disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, 
Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his 
side, I will not believe. <A name=C20V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after eight days again his 
disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, 
and stood in the midst, and said, Peace <I>be</I> unto you. <A name=C20V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then saith he to 
Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach <I>hither</I> thy 
hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. <A 
name=C20V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thomas answered and said unto him, My 
Lord and my God. <A name=C20V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto him, Because thou 
hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <I>are</I> they that have not seen, 
and <I>yet</I> have believed. <A name=C20V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many other signs therefore did Jesus 
in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book: <A 
name=C20V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but these are written, that ye may 
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have 
life in his name. 
<P>
<P><A name=C21V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things Jesus manifested 
himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested 
<I>himself</I> on this wise. <A name=C21V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was together Simon Peter, and 
Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <I>sons</I> of 
Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. <A name=C21V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a 
fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered 
into the boat; and that night they took nothing. <A name=C21V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when day was 
now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was 
Jesus. <A name=C21V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus therefore saith unto them, 
Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No. <A name=C21V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast 
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. <A 
name=C21V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That disciple therefore whom Jesus 
loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was 
the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into 
the sea. <A name=C21V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the other disciples came in the 
little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits 
off), dragging the net <I>full</I> of fishes. <A name=C21V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when they got 
out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and 
bread. <A name=C21V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the 
fish which ye have now taken. <A name=C21V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon Peter therefore went up, and 
drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and 
for all there were so many, the net was not rent. <A name=C21V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto 
them, Come <I>and</I> break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire 
of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. <A name=C21V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus cometh, and 
taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. <A name=C21V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is now the 
third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen 
from the dead. <A name=C21V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So when they had broken their fast, 
Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, <I>son</I> of John, lovest thou me more than 
these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith 
unto him, Feed my lambs. <A name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saith to him again a second time, 
Simon, <I>son</I> of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou 
knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep. <A name=C21V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saith unto him 
the third time, Simon, <I>son</I> of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved 
because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, 
Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto 
him, Feed my sheep. <A name=C21V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When 
thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but 
when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall 
gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. <A name=C21V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this he spake, 
signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken 
this, he saith unto him, Follow me. <A name=C21V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter, turning about, seeth the 
disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the 
supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? <A name=C21V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter therefore 
seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? <A 
name=C21V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that 
he tarry till I come, what <I>is that</I> to thee? Follow thou me. <A 
name=C21V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This saying therefore went forth among 
the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, 
that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <I>is 
that</I> to thee? <A name=C21V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is the disciple that beareth 
witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is 
true. <A name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there are also many other things 
which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that 
even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.
