<p>THE INFANCY GOSPEL OF<br>
JAMES<br>
<br>
The following translation is based on the Greek text<br>
printed in Ronald F. Hock's The Infancy Gospels of<br>
James and Thomas. The text, which provided the basis<br>
for the Jesus Seminar's &quot;Scholars Version&quot; translation of<br>
the Infancy Gospel of James, has been divided differently<br>
than in earlier critical editions to encourage precise<br>
notation.<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 1<br>
<br>
(1) In the histories of the twelve tribes of Israel,<br>
Joachim was an extremely rich man. (2) He always<br>
brought a double offering to the Lord, (3) telling<br>
himself, &quot;My offering for all the people is from my<br>
surplus and my own offering to the Lord God is for<br>
forgiveness, to atone for my sins.&quot;<br>
<br>
(4) As the great day of the Lord was drawing near<br>
and the children of Israel were bringing their<br>
offerings, however, (5) Reubel stood in his way,<br>
saying, &quot;You cannot offer your gifts first because<br>
you have not conceived a child in Israel.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And Joachim became extremely frustrated and<br>
went away to the history of the twelve tribes of his<br>
people, saying to himself, &quot;I will look in the<br>
history of the twelve tribes of Israel and see<br>
whether I am the only one who has not conceived<br>
a child in Israel.&quot; (7) And he searched and found<br>
that all the righteous people had raised children in<br>
Israel. (8) And he reminded himself about the<br>
patriarch Abraham and that the Lord God gave his<br>
son Isaac to him in his last days.<br>
<br>
(9) Then, Joachim was extremely frustrated and<br>
did not appear to his wife, but gave himself to the<br>
desert and pitched his tent there. (10) He fasted<br>
forty days and forty nights. (11) All the while,<br>
Joachim was saying to himself, &quot;I will not go down<br>
for food or drink until the Lord my God visits me;<br>
prayer will be my food and drink.&quot; <br>
CHAPTER 2<br>
(1) Then, his wife Anna mourned and lam&gt; <br>
<br>
<br>
Transfer interrupted!<br>
<br>
, &quot;I lament that I am a widow and I lament that I<br>
am childless.&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) When the great day of the Lord was drawing<br>
near, (3) her servant Juthine said to her, &quot;How<br>
long are you going to humble yourself? Do you not<br>
see that the great day of the Lord is approaching?<br>
You are not allowed to mourn. (4) Take this<br>
headband which the leader of the activity gave me.<br>
I am not allowed to tie it because I am your slave<br>
and it has a royal mark.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) Then, Anna said, &quot;Get away from me. I did not<br>
cause these things, even though the Lord God has<br>
humbled me greatly. Perhaps a crafty person has<br>
given this to you and you have come to cause me<br>
to partake of your sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And her servant Juthine said, &quot;Should I invoke<br>
a curse on you because you did not hear my<br>
voice? The Lord God has shut your womb and he<br>
will not give you offspring in Israel.&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) So Anna also became extremely frustrated and<br>
removed her mourning garment, washed her head<br>
and clothed herself with her wedding dress. (8)<br>
Around the ninth hour, she went down to her<br>
garden to walk around. She saw a laurel tree and<br>
sat down under it. (9) And after a rest, she<br>
petitioned the Lord, saying, &quot;God of my<br>
ancestors, bless me and hear my prayer, just as<br>
you blessed our mother Sarah and gave her son<br>
Isaac to her.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 3<br>
(1) And Anna looked up to the heavens and saw a<br>
nest of sparrows in the laurel tree. (2)<br>
Immediately, Anna cried out mournfully, saying to<br>
herself,<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh me, who gave birth to me? What womb<br>
caused me to grow? (3) For I was born cursed in<br>
front of the children of Israel. I am reviled and<br>
they treat me with contempt and cast me out of the<br>
temple of the Lord my God.<br>
<br>
(4) &quot;Oh me, what am I like? I am not like the birds<br>
of the sky, for the birds of the sky are fruitful<br>
before you, Lord.<br>
<br>
(5) &quot;Oh me, what am I like? I am not like the<br>
domestic animals, for the domestic animals are<br>
fruitful before you, Lord.<br>
<br>
(6) &quot;Oh me, what am I like? I am not like the wild<br>
animals of the earth, for the wild animals of the<br>
earth are fruitful before you, Lord.<br>
<br>
(7) &quot;Oh me, what am I like? I am not like these<br>
waters, for these waters are fruitful before you,<br>
Lord.<br>
<br>
(8) &quot;Oh me, what am I like? I am not like this<br>
earth, for the earth produces its fruit in season<br>
and blesses you, Lord.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 4<br>
(1) Suddenly, an angel of the Lord stood in front of<br>
her, saying, &quot;Anna, Anna, the Lord God has heard<br>
your prayer. You will conceive and give birth and<br>
your child will be spoken of everywhere people<br>
live.&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) And Anna said, &quot;As the Lord God lives,<br>
whether I give birth to either a male or a female<br>
child, I will bring it as an offering to the Lord my<br>
God and it will be a servant to him all the days of<br>
its life.&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) Next, two angels came, saying to her, &quot;Look<br>
your husband Joachim is coming with his flocks.&quot;<br>
(4) For an angel of the Lord had gone down to<br>
Joachim, saying, &quot;Joachim, Joachim, the Lord<br>
God has heard your prayer. Go down from here.<br>
Look, your wife Anna has conceived in her<br>
womb.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) Immediately, Joachim went down and called<br>
the shepherds, telling them, &quot;Bring ten lambs<br>
without spot or blemish here to me; the ten lambs<br>
will be for the Lord God. (6) Bring twelve tender<br>
calves; the twelve calves will be for the priests<br>
and the elders. (7) And bring one hundred male<br>
goats; the one hundred male goats will be for all<br>
the people.&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) Then, Joachim came with his flocks. Anna was<br>
standing at the gate. (9) When she saw Joachim<br>
coming with his flocks, Anna ran and wrapped<br>
herself around his neck, saying, &quot;Now I know that<br>
the Lord God has blessed me greatly. See, the<br>
widow is no longer a widow and the childless<br>
woman has conceived in her womb.&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) And Joachim rested for the first day he was<br>
home. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 5<br>
(1) The next day, when he was presenting his<br>
offerings, he said to himself, &quot;If the Lord God will<br>
be reconciled to me, he will make it clear to me<br>
with the priest's metal disc.&quot; (2) And Joachim<br>
presented his offerings and paid attention to the<br>
priest's metal disc until he went up to the altar of<br>
the Lord. And he saw no sin in it. (3) Joachim said,<br>
&quot;Now, I know that the Lord God has been<br>
reconciled to me and has sent all my great sins<br>
away for me.&quot; (4) And having been justified, he<br>
departed from the temple and went to his house.<br>
<br>
(5) And his wife's pregnancy came to term. After<br>
nine months, Anna gave birth (6) and she said to<br>
the midwife, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) The midwife said, &quot;A girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) Anna said, &quot;My soul exalts this day.&quot; And she<br>
put her baby to bed.<br>
<br>
(9) After her days were completed, Anna cleansed<br>
her menstrual flow (10) and gave her breast to the<br>
child and gave her the name Mary. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 6<br>
(1) Day by day, the child grew stronger. (2) When<br>
she was six months old, her mother set her on the<br>
ground to test whether she could stand. And after<br>
walking seven steps, she came to her mother's<br>
breast. (3) And her mother picked her up, saying,<br>
&quot;As the Lord my God lives, you will not walk on<br>
this earth again until I take you to the temple of<br>
the Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
(4) And she made a sanctuary in her bedroom and<br>
would not permit anything common or impure to<br>
pass through it. (5) And she called the pure<br>
daughters of the Hebrews and they played with<br>
her.<br>
<br>
(6) When the child's first birthday came, Joachim<br>
held a great celebration. He invited the high<br>
priests and the priests and the Sanhedrin and the<br>
whole nation of Israel. (7) And Joachim brought<br>
the child to the priests and they blessed her,<br>
saying, &quot;God of our ancestors, bless this child and<br>
give her name eternal fame among all<br>
generations.&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) And all the people said, &quot;Let it happen, amen.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And he brought the child to the high priests and<br>
they blessed her, saying, &quot;Exalted God, look upon<br>
this child and give her a final blessing which will<br>
not be succeeded.&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) And her mother took her up to the<br>
bedroom-sanctuary and gave her breast to the<br>
child. (11) And Anna composed a song for the<br>
Lord God, saying, &quot;I will sing a holy song to the<br>
Lord my God because he has examined me and<br>
removed my horrible disgrace from me. (12) And<br>
the Lord God gave me the fruit of his<br>
righteousness, of one nature, but manifold before<br>
him. (13) Who will proclaim to the sons of Reubel<br>
that Anna nurses a child? Do you hear? Hear this,<br>
twelve tribes of Israel: Anna nurses a child!&quot;<br>
<br>
(14) And she gave the child rest in the<br>
bedroom-sanctuary and went out and served them.<br>
(15) When dinner was completed, they departed<br>
feeling good and glorified the God of Israel. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 7<br>
(1) She cared for the child for months. When the<br>
child turned two years old, Joachim said, &quot;Let's<br>
take her to the temple of the Lord so we can<br>
relate the message we were given.&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) And Anna said, &quot;Let's wait until the third year,<br>
so that she will not seek her father or mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) And Joachim said, &quot;Let's wait.&quot;<br>
<br>
(4) When the child turned three, Joachim said,<br>
&quot;Let's call the pure women of the Hebrews. (5)<br>
Let them take up lamps and light them so that the<br>
child will not turn back and her heart will never be<br>
led away from the temple of the Lord.&quot; (6) And<br>
they did these things until they went up to the<br>
temple of the Lord.<br>
<br>
(7) And the priest welcomed her. Kissing her, he<br>
blessed her and said, &quot;The Lord God has<br>
magnified your name for all generations; (8)<br>
through you the Lord will reveal deliverance to the<br>
children of Israel in the last days.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And he set her down on the third step of the<br>
altar and the Lord God poured grace upon her.<br>
(10) She danced triumphantly with her drinks and<br>
every house in Israel loved her. <br>
CHAPTER 8<br>
(1) And her parents went down, marveling at and<br>
praising and glorifying the Lord God because the<br>
child had not turned back to look at them. (2)<br>
While Mary was in the temple of the Lord, she<br>
was fed like a dove and received food from the<br>
hand of an angel.<br>
<br>
(3) When she turned twelve, a group of priests<br>
took counsel together, saying, &quot;Look, Mary has<br>
been in the temple of the Lord twelve years. (4)<br>
What should we do about her now, so that she<br>
does not defile the sanctuary of the Lord our<br>
God?&quot; (5) And they said to the high priest, &quot;You<br>
have stood at the altar of the Lord. Go in and pray<br>
about her. And if the Lord God reveals anything to<br>
you, we will do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And the priest went in taking the vestment with<br>
twelve bells into the holy of holies and prayed<br>
about her. Suddenly, an angel of the Lord stood<br>
before him, saying, &quot;Zachariah, Zachariah, depart<br>
from here and gather the widowers of the people<br>
and let each one carry a staff. (8) And the one<br>
whom the Lord God points out with a sign, she will<br>
be his wife.&quot; (9) So the heralds went out to the<br>
whole surrounding area of Judea and the trumpet<br>
of the Lord rang out and all the men rushed in. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 9<br>
(1) Throwing down his ax, Joseph went out to meet<br>
them. (2) And after they had gathered together<br>
with their rods, they went to the high priest. (3)<br>
After receiving everyone's rod, the high priest<br>
went into the temple and prayed. (4) When he was<br>
finished with the prayer, he took the rods and went<br>
out and gave them to each man, (5) but there was<br>
no sign among them. Finally, Joseph took his rod.<br>
(6) Suddenly, a dove came out of the rod and stood<br>
on Joseph's head. (7) And the high priest said,<br>
&quot;Joseph! Joseph! You have been chosen by lot to<br>
take the virgin into your own keeping.&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) And Joseph replied, saying, &quot;I have sons and<br>
am old, while she is young. I will not be ridiculed<br>
among the children of Israel.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And the high priest said, &quot;Joseph, fear the<br>
Lord your God and remember what God did to<br>
Dathan and Abiron and Kore, how the earth split<br>
open and swallowed them because of their<br>
rebellion. (10) Now fear God, Joseph, so that<br>
these things do not happen in your house.&quot;<br>
<br>
(11) Fearing God, Joseph took her into his own<br>
possession. (12) And he said to her, &quot;Mary, I took<br>
you from the temple of the Lord and now I bring<br>
you into my house. I am going out to build houses,<br>
but I will come back to you. The Lord will protect<br>
you.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 10<br>
(1) Meanwhile, the priests were meeting together,<br>
saying, &quot;Let us make a curtain for the temple of<br>
the Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) And the high priest said, &quot;Call the pure virgins<br>
from the tribe of David to me.&quot; (3) And the<br>
servants went out and sought and found seven<br>
virgins. (4) And the high priest remembered that<br>
the child Mary was from the tribe of David and<br>
was pure before God. (5) So the servants went out<br>
and got her.<br>
<br>
(6) And they brought the women into the temple of<br>
the Lord. (7) And the high priest said, &quot;Cast lots<br>
to see who will spin the gold and the pure and the<br>
linen and the silk and the violet and the scarlet<br>
and the true purple threads.&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) And Mary was appointed by lot to the true<br>
purple and scarlet threads. And taking them, she<br>
went to her house. (9) This was at the same time<br>
Zachariah fell silent and Samuel replaced him until<br>
Zachariah could speak again. (10) Mary was<br>
spinning the scarlet thread which she had taken. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 11<br>
(1) And she took the cup and went out to fill it with<br>
water. (2) Suddenly, a voice said to her, &quot;Rejoice,<br>
blessed one. The Lord is with you. You are<br>
blessed among women.&quot; (3) And Mary looked<br>
around to the right and the left to see where this<br>
voice came from. (4) And trembling she went into<br>
her house. Setting down the cup, she took the<br>
purple thread and sat down on the chair and spun<br>
it.<br>
<br>
(5) Suddenly, an angel stood before her saying,<br>
&quot;Do not be afraid Mary. You have found grace<br>
before the Lord of all. You will conceive from his<br>
word.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) Upon hearing this, however, Mary was<br>
distraught, saying to herself, &quot;If I conceive from<br>
the Lord God who lives, will I also conceive as all<br>
women conceive?&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) And the Angel of the Lord said, &quot;Not like that,<br>
Mary. For the power of God will come over you.<br>
Thus, the holy one who is born will be called son of<br>
the most high. (8) And you will call his name<br>
Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And Mary said, &quot;See, I am the servant of the<br>
Lord before him. Let it happen to me according to<br>
what you say.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 12<br>
(1) And she made the purple and the scarlet<br>
thread and carried it to the high priest. (2) And<br>
taking it, the high priest blessed her and said,<br>
&quot;Mary, God has magnified your name. You will be<br>
called blessed among all the generations of the<br>
earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) Then, Mary went gladly to her cousin<br>
Elizabeth. (4) And she knocked at the door and<br>
when Elizabeth heard, she threw down her scarlet<br>
thread and ran to the door and opened it for her.<br>
(5) And she blessed her and said, &quot;Where have<br>
you come to me from? Why should the mother of<br>
my Lord come to me? See how the child in me<br>
leaps and blesses you.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) But Mary had forgotten the mysteries which<br>
the angel Gabriel had told her. And looking into<br>
heaven she said, &quot;Who am I, Lord, that all the<br>
generations of the earth will bless me?&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) She spent three months with Elizabeth. (8) Day<br>
after day, her womb swelled and she was afraid to<br>
go to her house and hid herself from the children<br>
of Israel. (9) Mary was sixteen years old when<br>
these mysterious things happened to her. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 13<br>
(1) In the sixth month of her pregnancy, Joseph<br>
came from his house-building and went into the<br>
house to find her swelling. (2) And he struck his<br>
face and threw himself on the ground in sackcloth<br>
and wept bitterly, &quot;How can I look to the Lord<br>
God? What will I pray about her, for I took her as<br>
a virgin from the temple of the Lord and did not<br>
guard her? (4) Who has set this trap for me? Who<br>
did this evil in my house? Who stole the virgin<br>
from me and defiled her. (5) Has not the story of<br>
Adam been repeated with me? For while Adam<br>
was glorifying God, the serpent came and found<br>
Eve alone and deceived her and defiled her - so it<br>
has also happened to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And Joseph got up from his sackcloth and<br>
called her and said to her, &quot;After having been<br>
cared for by God, what have you done? (7) Did<br>
you forget the Lord your God? You who were<br>
raised in the holy of holies, you who received from<br>
the hand of an angel, do you know how much you<br>
have humiliated yourself?&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) Then, she wept bitterly, saying, &quot;I am pure and<br>
I did not know a man.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And Joseph said to her, &quot;Where did this thing<br>
in your womb come from then?&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) But she said, &quot;As the Lord my God lives, I do<br>
not know where it came from.&quot; <br>
CHAPTER 14<br>
(1) Then, Joseph was extremely frightened and<br>
kept quiet about her, pondering what he should do.<br>
(2) And Joseph said to himself, &quot;If I hide her sin, I<br>
will be rebelling against the law of the Lord. (3)<br>
And if I expose her to the children of Israel . . .<br>
well, I am afraid that the child in her might be<br>
angelic and I will be betraying innocent blood to a<br>
judgment of death. (4) What then will I do about<br>
her? I will send her away from me secretly.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) And night overtook him. And suddenly an<br>
angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,<br>
saying, &quot;Do not fear this child. For the child in her<br>
is from the Holy Spirit. (6) She will bear a son for<br>
you and you will call his name Jesus. For he will<br>
save his people from their sins.&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) And Joseph arose from his sleep and glorified<br>
the God of Israel who had given grace to him. (8)<br>
And he guarded the child. <br>
CHAPTER 15<br>
(1) Then, Annas the scribe came to him and said to<br>
him, &quot;Joseph, why have you not appeared to our<br>
traveling group?&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) And he said to him, &quot;Because I was worn out<br>
from the trip and rested my first day back.&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) And Annas turned and saw Mary pregnant.<br>
<br>
(4) And he ran off at top speed to the high priest<br>
and said to him, &quot;Look at Joseph, the one you<br>
bear witness for. He has broken the law badly.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) And the high priest said, &quot;What is this?&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And he said, &quot;The virgin which Joseph<br>
received from the temple of the Lord, he defiled<br>
her and has stolen her wedding festivities and has<br>
not revealed it to the children of Israel.&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) And he said to him, &quot;Has Joseph done these<br>
things?&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) And he said to him, &quot;Send a servant and he will<br>
find the virgin pregnant.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And the servants went and found her just as he<br>
said and they led her with Joseph to the law court.<br>
<br>
(10) And the high priest said to her, &quot;Mary, what<br>
is this? How have you humiliated yourself? (11)<br>
Did you forget the Lord your God, you who were<br>
raised in the holy of holies and received from the<br>
hand of an angel? (12) You who heard their songs<br>
and danced before them, what is this?&quot;<br>
<br>
(13) And she wept bitterly, saying, &quot;As the Lord<br>
God lives, I am pure before him and I did not<br>
know a man.&quot;<br>
<br>
(14) And the high priest said, &quot;Joseph, what is<br>
this?&quot;<br>
<br>
(15) But Joseph said, &quot;As the Lord lives, I am<br>
pure from her.&quot;<br>
<br>
(16) And the high priest said, &quot;Do not lie, but<br>
speak the truth. You stole your wedding festivities<br>
and did not reveal it to the children of Israel (17)<br>
and you did not bow your head before the mighty<br>
hand that it should bless your seed.&quot;<br>
<br>
(18) And Joseph was silent. <br>
CHAPTER 16<br>
(1) And the high priest said, &quot;Return the virgin<br>
which you took from the temple of the Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) And Joseph, becoming tearful [...]<br>
<br>
(3) And the high priest said, &quot;I will give you the<br>
water of the Lord's wrath to drink and it will make<br>
your sin clear in your eyes.&quot; (4) And taking the<br>
water, the high priest gave it to Joseph to drink<br>
and sent him out into the desert. And he returned<br>
unharmed.<br>
<br>
(5) And he made the young girl drink also and sent<br>
her out into the desert. And she came back<br>
unharmed. (6) And all the people were astonished<br>
that their sins were not revealed. (7) And the high<br>
priest said, &quot;If the Lord God has not revealed<br>
your sins, I will not judge you either.&quot; And he<br>
released them. (8) And Joseph took Mary and<br>
went away to his house, rejoicing and praising the<br>
God of Israel. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 17<br>
(1) Then, there was an order from the Emperor<br>
Augustus to register how many people were in<br>
Bethlehem of Judea. (2) And Joseph said, &quot;I will<br>
register my sons. But this child? What will I do<br>
about him? How will I register him? (3) And my<br>
wife? Oh, I am ashamed. Should I register her as<br>
my daughter? The children of Israel know that she<br>
is not my daughter. (4) This day, I will do as the<br>
Lord wants.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) And he saddled his donkey and sat her on it<br>
and his son led and Samuel followed. (6) And they<br>
arrived at the third mile and Joseph turned and<br>
saw that she was sad. (7) And he said to himself,<br>
&quot;Perhaps the child within her is troubling her.&quot; (8)<br>
And again Joseph turned around and saw her<br>
laughing and said to her, &quot;Mary, what is with you?<br>
First your face appears happy and then sad?&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And she said, &quot;Joseph, it is because I see two<br>
people with my eyes, one crying and being<br>
afflicted, one rejoicing and being extremely<br>
happy.&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) When they came to the middle of the journey,<br>
Mary said to him, &quot;Joseph, take me off the<br>
donkey, the child pushing from within me to let<br>
him come out.&quot;<br>
<br>
(11) So he took her off the donkey and said to her,<br>
&quot;Where will I take you and shelter you in your<br>
awkwardness? This area is a desert.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 18<br>
(1) And he found a cave and led her there and<br>
stationed his sons to watch her, (2) while he went<br>
to a find a Hebrew midwife in the land of<br>
Bethlehem.<br>
<br>
(3) Then, Joseph wandered, but he did not wander.<br>
(4) And I looked up to the peak of the sky and saw<br>
it standing still and I looked up into the air. With<br>
utter astonishment I saw it, even the birds of the<br>
sky were not moving. (5) And I looked at the<br>
ground and saw a bowl lying there and workers<br>
reclining. And their hands were in the bowl. (6)<br>
And chewing, they were not chewing. And picking<br>
food up, they were not picking it up. And putting<br>
food in their mouths, they were not putting it in<br>
their mouths. (7) Rather, all their faces were<br>
looking up.<br>
<br>
(8) And I saw sheep being driven, but the sheep<br>
were standing still. (9) And the shepherd lifted up<br>
his hand to strike them, but his hand remained<br>
above them. (10) And I saw the rushing current of<br>
the river and I saw goats and their mouths resting<br>
in the water, but they were not drinking. (11) And<br>
suddenly everything was replaced by the ordinary<br>
course of events. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 19<br>
(1) And I saw a woman coming down from the<br>
mountain and she said to me, &quot;Man, where are<br>
you going?&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) And I said, &quot;I am seeking a Hebrew midwife.&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) Replying, she said to me, &quot;Are you from<br>
Israel?&quot;<br>
<br>
(4) And I said to her, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) Then, she said, &quot;And who is giving birth in the<br>
cave?&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And I said, &quot;The one who has pledged to be<br>
married to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
(7) And she said to me, &quot;She is not your wife?&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) And I said to her, &quot;She is Mary, the one who<br>
was raised in the temple. I won her by lot to be my<br>
wife. (9) She is not yet my wife, but has a fetus<br>
from the Holy Spirit.&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) And the midwife said, &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
<br>
(11) And Joseph said to her, &quot;Come and see.&quot;<br>
<br>
(12) So the midwife went with him. (13) And they<br>
stood near the cave and a dark cloud was hovering<br>
over the cave. (14) And the midwife said, &quot;My<br>
soul glorifies this day, for today my eyes have<br>
seen a miracle: salvation has come to Israel.&quot;<br>
<br>
(15) And immediately, the cloud withdrew from the<br>
cave and a great light appeared in the cave so that<br>
their eyes could not bear it. (16) And a little while<br>
later the same light withdrew until an infant<br>
appeared. And he came and took the breast of his<br>
mother, Mary.<br>
<br>
(17) And the midwife cried out and said, &quot;How<br>
great this day is for me, for I have seen this new<br>
miracle.&quot;<br>
<br>
(18) And the midwife departed from the cave and<br>
met Salome and said to her, &quot;Salome, Salome, I<br>
have to describe this new miracle for you. A virgin<br>
has given birth, although her body does not allow<br>
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
(19) And Salome said, &quot;As the Lord my God lives,<br>
unless I insert my finger and investigate her, I will<br>
not believe that a virgin has given birth.&quot; <br>
CHAPTER 20<br>
(1) And the midwife went in and said, &quot;Mary,<br>
position yourself, for not a small test concerning<br>
you is about to take place.&quot;<br>
<br>
(2) When Mary heard these things, she positioned<br>
herself. And Salome inserted her finger into her<br>
body. (3) And Salome cried out and said, &quot;Woe for<br>
my lawlessness and the unbelief that made me test<br>
the living God. Look, my hand is falling away from<br>
me and being consumed in fire.&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) And Salome dropped to her knees before the<br>
Lord, saying, &quot;God of Abraham and Isaac and<br>
Jacob, (6) do not expose me to the children of<br>
Israel, but give me back to the poor. (7) For you<br>
know, Lord, that I have performed service and<br>
received my wage from you.&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared,<br>
saying to her, &quot;Salome, Salome, the Lord of all<br>
has heard your entreaty. (9) Stretch out your hand<br>
to the child and lift him up and he will be salvation<br>
and joy for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) And Salome went to the child and lifted him<br>
up, saying, &quot;I worship him because he has been<br>
born a king to Israel.&quot; (11) And at once Salome<br>
was healed and left the cave justified.<br>
<br>
(12) Suddenly, there was a voice saying, &quot;Salome,<br>
Salome, do not proclaim what a miracle you have<br>
seen until the child comes to Jerusalem.&quot; <br>
CHAPTER 21<br>
(1) Now, Joseph was about to depart to Judea<br>
when there a great commotion in Bethlehem of<br>
Judea. (2) For astrologers had come, saying,<br>
&quot;Where is the one who has been born king of the<br>
Jews? For we saw his star in the East and came to<br>
worship him.&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) And when Herod heard, he was shaken up and<br>
sent servants to the astrologers. (4) And he also<br>
sent for the high priests and questioned them in<br>
his palace, saying to them, &quot;What has been<br>
written about the messiah? Where will he be<br>
born?&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) They said to him, &quot;In Bethlehem of Judea, for<br>
so it has been written.&quot; (6) And he let them go.<br>
<br>
(7) And he questioned the astrologers, saying to<br>
them, &quot;What sign did you see about the one who<br>
has been born king?&quot;<br>
<br>
(8) And the astrologers said, &quot;We saw a star<br>
shining with incredible brilliance amidst the<br>
constellations and making them seem dim. And so<br>
we knew that the king had been born in Israel and<br>
we came to worship him.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And Herod said to them, &quot;Go and search. If<br>
you find him, report to me so that I also may come<br>
and worship him.&quot;<br>
<br>
(10) And the wise men departed. Then, the star<br>
which they had seen in the east led them until they<br>
came to the cave and stood over the head of the<br>
child. (11) And when the astrologers saw him with<br>
his mother Mary, they took gifts out of their bags:<br>
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br>
<br>
(12) And having been warned by the angel not to<br>
go into Judea, they returned to their country by<br>
another road. <br>
CHAPTER 22<br>
(1) When Herod saw that he had been tricked by<br>
the astrologers, he flew into a rage (2) and sent his<br>
executioners, telling them to destroy all the<br>
infants that were two years old or younger.<br>
<br>
(3) And when Mary heard that all the children<br>
were being destroyed, she was afraid and took the<br>
child and wrapped him up and put him in a stall of<br>
cows.<br>
<br>
(5) And when Elizabeth heard that John was being<br>
sought, she took him and headed for the hills. And<br>
she looked around to find where she could hide<br>
him, but there was not any good place. (7) Then,<br>
as Elizabeth sighed, she said with a loud voice,<br>
&quot;Mountain of God, take me, a mother with her<br>
child.&quot; For Elizabeth was too afraid to go up<br>
higher. (8) And at once, the mountain split open<br>
and received her. And there was light shining<br>
through the mountain to her. (9) For an angel of<br>
the Lord was with them, guarding them. <br>
CHAPTER 23<br>
(1) But Herod continued seeking John. (2) And he<br>
sent his servants to Zachariah at the altar, saying<br>
to him, &quot;Where did you hide your son?&quot;<br>
<br>
(3) But he replied, saying to them, &quot;I am here as a<br>
servant of God and am serving in his temple. How<br>
should I know where my son is?&quot;<br>
<br>
(4) And his servants departed and reported to him<br>
all these things. Outraged, Herod said, &quot;Is his son<br>
destined to rule Israel?&quot;<br>
<br>
(5) And he sent his servants again, saying to him,<br>
&quot;Tell me the truth? Where is your son? Do you<br>
know that your blood is under my hand?&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) And the servants departed and reported these<br>
things to him.<br>
<br>
(7) And replying, Zachariah said, &quot;I am a witness<br>
of God. Have my blood. (8) The Lord will receive<br>
my spirit because you are shedding innocent blood<br>
at the entrance of the temple of the Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
(9) And around daybreak, Zachariah was<br>
murdered, even though the children of Israel did<br>
not know that he had been murdered. <br>
CHAPTER 24<br>
(1) Then, at the hour of greeting, the priests<br>
departed and the blessing of Zachariah did not<br>
greet them as usual. (2) Expecting Zachariah, the<br>
priests waited to welcome him with prayer and to<br>
praise the most high God.<br>
<br>
(3) When he failed to come, they were all afraid.<br>
(4) One of them courageously went into the<br>
sanctuary and saw hardened blood next to the<br>
altar of the Lord (5) and heard a loud voice saying,<br>
&quot;Zachariah has been murdered and his blood will<br>
not be wiped away until vengeance comes.&quot;<br>
<br>
(6) When he heard these words, he was afraid and<br>
went out and told the priest what he had seen and<br>
heard. (7) And gathering up their courage, they<br>
went in and saw what had happened. (8) And as<br>
the panels of the temple cried out, they ripped<br>
their robes from the top down. (9) And they did not<br>
find the corpse, but they found his blood which had<br>
turned to stone. (10) And fearing, they went out<br>
and reported to the people that Zachariah had<br>
been murdered. (11) And all the tribes of the<br>
people heard and they mourned and wept for three<br>
days and three nights.<br>
<br>
(12) Then, after three days, the priests deliberated<br>
about who they should appoint to take the place of<br>
Zachariah. (13) And the lot went to Simeon. (14)<br>
For he was the one to whom it had been revealed<br>
by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death until<br>
he saw the messiah in the flesh. <br>
CHAPTER 25<br>
(1) I, James, wrote this history when there was<br>
unrest in Jerusalem, at the time Herod died. (2) I<br>
took myself into the desert until the unrest in<br>
Jerusalem ceased. (3) All the while, I was<br>
glorifying God who gave me the wisdom to write<br>
this history.<br>
<br>
(4) And grace will be with all who fear the Lord.<br>
Amen. Birth of Mary Revelation of James Peace<br>
