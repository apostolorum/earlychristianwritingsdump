<H1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus 
Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, <A name=C1V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to the assembly of 
God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be 
saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, 
both theirs and ours: <A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Grace to you and peace from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<P><A name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I always thank my God concerning you, 
for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus; <A name=C1V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that in everything 
you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge; <A name=C1V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even as the 
testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so that you come behind in no gift; 
waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; <A name=C1V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who will also 
confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <A 
name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God 
is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. <A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I beg you, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N1">brothers,</A> through the 
name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there 
be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind 
and in the same judgment. <A name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it has been reported to me 
concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there 
are contentions among you. <A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I mean this, that each one of you 
says, "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas," and, "I follow 
Christ." <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified 
for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? <A name=C1V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I thank God that I 
baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius, <A name=C1V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so that no one 
should say that I had baptized you into my own name. <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(I also baptized 
the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any 
other.) <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but 
to preach the Gospel--not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ 
wouldn't be made void. <A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the word of the cross is 
foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of 
God. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"I will destroy the wisdom of the 
wise,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bring the discernment of the 
discerning to nothing." 
<P><A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? 
Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this 
world? <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, 
the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through 
the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe. <A name=C1V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Jews ask for 
signs, Greeks seek after wisdom, <A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but we preach Christ crucified; a 
stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks, <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but to those who 
are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of 
God. <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because the foolishness of God is wiser 
than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. <A name=C1V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you see your 
calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many 
mighty, and not many noble; <A name=C1V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but God chose the foolish things of the 
world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things 
of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong; <A 
name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and God chose the lowly things of the 
world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he 
might bring to nothing the things that are: <A name=C1V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that no flesh 
should boast before God. <A name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, 
who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and 
redemption: <A name=C1V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that, according as it is written, "He 
who boasts, let him boast in the Lord." 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I came to you, brothers, I didn't 
come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of 
God. <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I determined not to know anything 
among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. <A name=C2V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I was with you in 
weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. <A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>My speech and my preaching were not in 
persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of 
power, <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that your faith wouldn't stand in the 
wisdom of men, but in the power of God. <A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We speak wisdom, however, among those 
who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this 
world, who are coming to nothing. <A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, 
the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for 
our glory, <A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which none of the rulers of this world 
has known. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of 
glory. <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't 
hear,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which didn't enter into the heart 
of man, 
<P>&nbsp;These God has prepared for those who love him." 
<P><A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to us, God revealed them through 
the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. <A 
name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For who among men knows the things of a 
man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the 
things of God, except God's Spirit. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we received, not the spirit of the 
world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were 
freely given to us by God. <A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which things also we speak, not in 
words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing 
spiritual things with spiritual things. <A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the natural man doesn't receive the 
things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, 
because they are spiritually discerned. <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he who is spiritual discerns all 
things, and he himself is judged by no one. <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"For who has known 
the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have Christ's mind. 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to 
spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ. <A name=C3V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I fed you with milk, 
not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready, <A 
name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for 
you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions 
among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men? <A 
name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you 
fleshly? <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, 
but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him? <A 
name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase. <A name=C3V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then neither he 
who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. <A 
name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now 
he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own 
reward according to his own labor. <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we are God's fellow workers. You are 
God's farming, God's building. <A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>According to the grace of God which was 
given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on 
it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it. <A name=C3V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For no one can lay 
any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. <A 
name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if anyone builds on the foundation 
with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble; <A name=C3V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>each man's work 
will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; 
and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is. <A 
name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If 
any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward. <A 
name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If 
any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but 
as through fire. 
<P><A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that you are a temple of 
God, and that God's Spirit lives in you? <A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If anyone destroys the temple of God, 
God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are. <A 
name=C3V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone 
thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he 
may become wise. <A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the wisdom of this world is 
foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their 
craftiness." <A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again, "The Lord knows the 
reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless." <A name=C3V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let no 
one boast in men. For all things are yours, <A name=C3V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whether Paul, or 
Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or 
things to come. All are yours, <A name=C3V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and you are Christ's, and Christ is 
God's. 
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So let a man think of us as Christ's 
servants, and stewards of God's mysteries. <A name=C4V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Here, moreover, it 
is required of stewards, that they be found faithful. <A name=C4V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But with me it is a 
very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment. Yes, I 
don't judge my own self. <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I know nothing against myself. Yet I 
am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord. <A name=C4V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore judge 
nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the 
hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man 
will get his praise from God. 
<P><A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now these things, brothers, I have in a 
figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might 
learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be 
puffed up against one another. <A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For who makes you different? And what do 
you have that you didn't receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as 
if you had not received it? <A name=C4V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You are already filled. You have already 
become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did 
reign, that we also might reign with you. <A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For, I think that God has displayed us, 
the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a 
spectacle to the world, both to angels and men. <A name=C4V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We are fools for 
Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You 
have honor, but we have dishonor. <A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even to this present hour we hunger, 
thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place. <A 
name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We 
toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being 
persecuted, we endure. <A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being defamed, we entreat. We are made 
as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now. <A 
name=C4V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved 
children. <A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though you have ten thousand tutors 
in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father 
through the Gospel. <A name=C4V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I beg you therefore, be imitators of 
me. <A name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because of this I have sent Timothy to 
you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my 
ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly. <A 
name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now some are puffed up, as though I 
were not coming to you. <A name=C4V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I will come to you shortly, if the 
Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but 
the power. <A name=C4V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Kingdom of God is not in word, 
but in power. <A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What do you want? Shall I come to you 
with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness? 
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is actually reported that there is 
sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named 
among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife. <A name=C5V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You are puffed up, 
and didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from 
among you. <A name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I most assuredly, as being absent in 
body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him 
who has done this thing. <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, <A name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>are to deliver such a one to Satan for 
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the 
Lord Jesus. 
<P><A name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Your boasting is not good. Don't you 
know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump? <A name=C5V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Purge out the old 
yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed 
Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place. <A name=C5V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let us 
keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and 
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <A 
name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; <A 
name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yet not at all meaning with the sexual 
sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; 
for then you would have to leave the world. <A name=C5V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as it is, I 
wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a 
sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an 
extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person. <A name=C5V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what have I to 
do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are 
within? <A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But those who are outside, God judges. 
"Put away the wicked man from among yourselves." 
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Dare any of you, having a matter against 
his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? <A 
name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that the saints will 
judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge 
the smallest matters? <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that we will judge 
angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? <A name=C6V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If then, you have to 
judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no 
account in the assembly? <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say this to move you to shame. Isn't 
there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his 
brothers? <A name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But brother goes to law with brother, 
and that before unbelievers! <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore it is already altogether a 
defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be 
wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No, but you yourselves do wrong, and 
defraud, and that against your brothers. <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or don't you know that the unrighteous 
will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived. Neither the sexually 
immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, 
<A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor 
drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God. <A 
name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Such were some of you, but you were 
washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord 
Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God. <A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"All things are lawful for me," but not 
all things are expedient. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be 
brought under the power of anything. <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Foods for the belly, and the belly for 
foods," but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for 
sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. <A 
name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now God raised up the Lord, and will 
also raise us up by his power. <A name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that your bodies are 
members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them 
members of a prostitute? May it never be! <A name=C6V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or don't you know 
that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, "The two," says he, 
"will become one flesh." <A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he who is joined to the Lord is one 
spirit. <A name=C6V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Flee sexual immorality! "Every sin that 
a man does is outside the body," but he who commits sexual immorality sins 
against his own body. <A name=C6V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or don't you know that your body is a 
temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not 
your own, <A name=C6V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for you were bought with a price. 
Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's. 
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now concerning the things about which 
you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman. <A name=C7V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But, because of 
sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her 
own husband. <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let the husband render to his wife the 
affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. <A 
name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The 
wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also 
the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife. <A 
name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't deprive one another, unless it is 
by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and 
may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of 
self-control. 
<P><A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this I say by way of concession, not 
of commandment. <A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yet I wish that all men were like me. 
However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of 
that kind. <A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say to the unmarried and to 
widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am. <A name=C7V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if they don't 
have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn. <A 
name=C7V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to the married I command--not I, 
but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband <A name=C7V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(but if she 
departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and 
that the husband not leave his wife. 
<P><A name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, 
if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let 
him not leave her. <A name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman who has an unbelieving 
husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband. <A 
name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the unbelieving husband is 
sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. 
Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now are they holy. <A 
name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yet if the unbeliever departs, let 
there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such 
cases, but God has called us in peace. <A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For how do you know, wife, whether you 
will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your 
wife? <A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Only, as the Lord has distributed to 
each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the 
assemblies. 
<P><A name=C7V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Was anyone called having been 
circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in 
uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. <A name=C7V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Circumcision is 
nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of 
God. <A name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let each man stay in that calling in 
which he was called. <A name=C7V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Were you called being a bondservant? 
Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it. 
<A name=C7V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he who was called in the Lord being 
a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is 
Christ's bondservant. <A name=C7V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You were bought with a price. Don't 
become bondservants of men. <A name=C7V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brothers, let each man, in whatever 
condition he was called, stay in that condition with God. 
<P><A name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now concerning virgins, I have no 
commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy 
from the Lord to be trustworthy. <A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I think that it is good therefore, 
because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is. 
<A name=C7V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to 
be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don't seek a wife. <A name=C7V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if you marry, 
you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have 
oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you. <A name=C7V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say this, 
brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be 
as though they had none; <A name=C7V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and those who weep, as though they 
didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who 
buy, as though they didn't possess; <A name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and those who use the world, as not 
using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away. <A 
name=C7V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I desire to have you to be free 
from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he 
may please the Lord; <A name=C7V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he who is married is concerned 
about the things of the world, how he may please his wife. <A name=C7V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There is also a 
difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the 
things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who 
is married cares about the things of the world--how she may please her husband. 
<A name=C7V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This I say for your own profit; not 
that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may 
attend to the Lord without distraction. <A name=C7V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if any man thinks that he is 
behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her 
age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin. Let 
them marry. <A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he who stands steadfast in his 
heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own 
virgin, does well. <A name=C7V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then both he who gives his own 
virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does 
better. <A name=C7V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A wife is bound by law for as long as 
her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to 
whoever she desires, only in the Lord. <A name=C7V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But she is happier if she stays as she 
is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit. 
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now concerning things sacrificed to 
idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds 
up. <A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if anyone thinks that he knows 
anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know. <A name=C8V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if anyone loves 
God, the same is known by him. <A name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore concerning the eating of 
things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and 
that there is no other God but one. <A name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though there are things that are 
called "gods," whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many "gods" and 
many "lords;" <A name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yet to us there is one God, the Father, 
of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom 
are all things, and we live through him. <A name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However, that knowledge isn't in all 
men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing 
sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <A 
name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; 
nor, if we eat, are we the better. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But be careful that by no means does 
this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak. <A name=C8V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if a man sees 
you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he 
is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <A name=C8V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And through your 
knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <A 
name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and 
wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. <A 
name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, if food causes my brother to 
stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to 
stumble. 
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? 
Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord? <A 
name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If 
to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of 
my apostleship in the Lord. <A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

this. <A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Have we no right to eat and to drink? <A 
name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Have 
we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the 
apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? <A name=C9V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or have only 
Barnabas and I no right to not work? <A name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What soldier ever serves at his own 
expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a 
flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk? <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do I speak these 
things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing? 
<A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is written in the law of Moses, 
"You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain." Is it for the oxen 
that God cares, <A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>or does he say it assuredly for our 
sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in 
hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope. <A 
name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If 
we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly 
things? <A name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If others partake of this right over 
you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all 
things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Gospel of Christ. <A 
name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that those who serve 
around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on 
the altar have their portion with the altar? <A name=C9V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even so the Lord 
ordained that those who proclaim the Gospel should live from the Gospel. <A 
name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I have used none of these things, 
and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would 
rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void. <A name=C9V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if I preach the 
Gospel, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is 
to me, if I don't preach the Gospel. <A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if I do this of my own will, I have 
a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. <A 
name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What then is my reward? That, when I 
preach the Gospel, I may present the Gospel of Christ without charge, so as not 
to abuse my authority in the Gospel. <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though I was free from all, I 
brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <A 
name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To 
the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the 
law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law; <A 
name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to 
those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but 
under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law. <A 
name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To 
the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things 
to all men, that I may by all means save some. <A name=C9V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I do this for 
the Gospel's sake, that I may be a joint partaker of it. <A name=C9V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that 
those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that 
you may win. <A name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every man who strives in the games 
exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible 
crown, but we an incorruptible. <A name=C9V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I therefore run like that, as not 
uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air, <A name=C9V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but I beat my body 
and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to 
others, I myself should be rejected. 
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I would not have you ignorant, 
brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the 
sea; <A name=C10V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and were all baptized into Moses in the 
cloud and in the sea; <A name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and all ate the same spiritual food; <A 
name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and all drank the same spiritual drink. 
For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. 
<A name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However with most of them, God was not 
well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. <A name=C10V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now these things 
were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they 
also lusted. <A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither be idolaters, as some of them 
were. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to 
play." <A name=C10V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither let us commit sexual 
immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand 
fell. <A name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither let us test the Lord, as some 
of them tested, and perished by the serpents. <A name=C10V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither grumble, 
as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer. <A 
name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now all these things happened to them 
by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of 
the ages have come. <A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let him who thinks he stands 
be careful that he doesn't fall. 
<P><A name=C10V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No temptation has taken you except 
what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted 
above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of 
escape, that you may be able to endure it. <A name=C10V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, my 
beloved, flee from idolatry. <A name=C10V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I speak as to wise men. Judge what I 
say. <A name=C10V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The cup of blessing which we bless, 
isn't it a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn't it 
a communion of the body of Christ? <A name=C10V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because we, who are many, are one 
bread, one body; for we all partake of the one bread. <A name=C10V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Consider Israel 
after the flesh. Don't those who eat the sacrifices have communion with the 
altar? 
<P><A name=C10V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What am I saying then? That a thing 
sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <A 
name=C10V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say that the things which the 
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire 
that you would have communion with demons. <A name=C10V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You can't both 
drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the 
table of the Lord, and of the table of demons. <A name=C10V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or do we provoke 
the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? <A name=C10V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"All things are 
lawful for me," but not all things are profitable. "All things are lawful for 
me," but not all things build up. <A name=C10V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let no one seek his own, but each one 
his neighbor's good. <A name=C10V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, 
eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience, <A name=C10V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for "the earth is 
the Lord's, and its fullness." <A name=C10V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if one of those who don't believe 
invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before 
you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience. <A name=C10V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if anyone says 
to you, "This was offered to idols," don't eat it for the sake of the one who 
told you, and for the sake of conscience. For "the earth is the Lord's, and all 
its fullness." <A name=C10V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Conscience, I say, not your own, but 
the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience? <A 
name=C10V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

I denounced for that for which I give thanks? <A name=C10V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whether therefore 
you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. <A

size=-1><SUP>10:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Give no occasions for stumbling, 
either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God; <A name=C10V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even as I also 
please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the 
many, that they may be saved. 
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be imitators of me, even as I also am 
of Christ. <A name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I praise you, brothers, that you 
remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered 
them to you. <A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I would have you know that the head 
of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of 
Christ is God. <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every man praying or prophesying, 
having his head covered, dishonors his head. <A name=C11V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But every woman 
praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one 
and the same thing as if she were shaved. <A name=C11V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if a woman is 
not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be 
shorn or shaved, let her be covered. <A name=C11V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For a man indeed ought not to have his 
head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the 
glory of the man. <A name=C11V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For man is not from woman, but woman 
from man; <A name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for neither was man created for the 
woman, but woman for the man. <A name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause the woman ought to have 
authority on her head, because of the angels. 
<P><A name=C11V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nevertheless, neither is the woman 
independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord. <A 
name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as woman came from man, so a man 
also comes through a woman; but all things are from God. <A name=C11V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Judge for 
yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled? <A 
name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Doesn't even nature itself teach you 
that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? <A name=C11V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if a woman has 
long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering. <A 
name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if any man seems to be 
contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies. 
<P><A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But in giving you this command, I 
don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
<A name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For first of all, when you come 
together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly 
believe it. <A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there also must be factions among 
you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you. <A name=C11V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore you 
assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper. <A 
name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For in your eating each one takes his 
own supper before others. One is hungry, and another is drunken. <A 
name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What, don't you have houses to eat and 
to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't 
have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you. 
<P><A name=C11V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I received from the Lord that 
which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was 
betrayed took bread. <A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had given thanks, he broke it, 
and said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for 
you. Do this in memory of me."</FONT> <A name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the same way he also took the cup, 
after supper, saying, <FONT color=#ff0000>"This cup is the new covenant in my 
blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me."</FONT> <A 
name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as often as you eat this bread and 
drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <A 
name=C11V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore whoever eats this bread or 
drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the 
body and the blood of the Lord. <A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But let a man examine himself, and so 
let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. <A name=C11V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he who eats 
and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he 
doesn't discern the Lord's body. <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause many among you are weak 
and sickly, and not a few sleep. <A name=C11V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if we discerned ourselves, we 
wouldn't be judged. <A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when we are judged, we are 
punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. <A 
name=C11V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, my brothers, when you come 
together to eat, wait one for another. <A name=C11V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat 
at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order 
whenever I come. 
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now concerning spiritual things, 
brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant. <A name=C12V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You know that when 
you were <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N2">heathen</A>, you 
were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led. <A name=C12V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore I make 
known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No 
one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit. <A name=C12V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there are 
various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
<P><A name=C12V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the same Lord. <A name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There are various kinds of workings, 
but the same God, who works all things in all. <A name=C12V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to each one is 
given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all. <A name=C12V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For to one is given 
through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, 
according to the same Spirit; <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to another faith, by the same Spirit; 
and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit; <A name=C12V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to another 
workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of 
spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the 
interpretation of languages. <A name=C12V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the one and the same Spirit works 
all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires. 
<P><A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as the body is one, and has many 
members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is 
Christ. <A name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For in one Spirit we were all baptized 
into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given 
to drink into one Spirit. <A name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the body is not one member, but 
many. <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If the foot would say, "Because I'm 
not the hand, I'm not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the 
body. <A name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If the ear would say, "Because I'm not 
the eye, I'm not part of the body," it's not therefore not part of the body. <A

one member, where would the body be? <A name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

body. <A name=C12V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. <A

Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you. 
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing. <A name=C13V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If I dole out all 
my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have

<P><A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they 
will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with. <A 
name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

part; <A name=C13V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

fully, even as I was also fully known. <A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. <A name=C14V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he who speaks 
in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but 
in the Spirit he speaks mysteries. <A name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

their edification, exhortation, and consolation. <A name=C14V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He who speaks in 
another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly. <A 
name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I desire to have you all speak with 
other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who 
prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that 
the assembly may be built up. 
<P><A name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N3">brothers,</A> if I come to 
you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to 
you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of 
teaching? <A name=C14V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even things without life, giving a 
voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, 
how would it be known what is piped or harped? <A name=C14V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the trumpet 
gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war? <A name=C14V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So also you, unless 
you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what 
is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air. <A name=C14V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There are, it may 
be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning. 
<A name=C14V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If then I don't know the meaning of 
the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be 
a foreigner to me. <A name=C14V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So also you, since you are zealous for 
spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly. <A 
name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let him who speaks in 
another language pray that he may interpret. <A name=C14V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if I pray in 
another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
<P><A name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What is it then? I will pray with the 
spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the 
spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. <A name=C14V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Otherwise if you 
bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the 
"Amen" at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say? <A 
name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you most assuredly give thanks 
well, but the other person is not built up. <A name=C14V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I thank my God, I 
speak with other languages more than you all. <A name=C14V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However in the 
assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might 
instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language. 
<P><A name=C14V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brothers, don't be children in 
thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature. <A 
name=C14V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the law it is written, "By men of 
strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not 
even thus will they hear me, says the Lord." <A name=C14V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore other 
languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but 
prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe. <A 
name=C14V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore the whole assembly is 
assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or 
unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy? <A 
name=C14V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if all prophesy, and someone 
unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by 
all. <A name=C14V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And thus the secrets of his heart are 
revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God 
is among you indeed. 
<P><A name=C14V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What is it then, brothers? When you 
come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, 
has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build 
each other up. <A name=C14V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If any man speaks in another language, 
let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret. <A 
name=C14V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if there is no interpreter, let 
him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God. <A 
name=C14V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let the prophets speak, two or three, 
and let the others discern. <A name=C14V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if a revelation is made to another 
sitting by, let the first keep silent. <A name=C14V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you all can prophesy one by one, 
that all may learn, and all may be exhorted. <A name=C14V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The spirits of the 
prophets are subject to the prophets, <A name=C14V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for God is not a God of confusion, but 
of peace. 
<P>As in all the assemblies of the saints, <A name=C14V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>let your wives 
keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; 
but let them be in subjection, as the law also says. <A name=C14V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If they desire to 
learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for 
a woman to chatter in the assembly. <A name=C14V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What? Was it from you that the word of 
God went out? Or did it come to you alone? <A name=C14V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If any man thinks 
himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I 
write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord. <A name=C14V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if anyone is 
ignorant, let him be ignorant. <A name=C14V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly 
to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages. <A 
name=C14V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let all things be done decently and in 
order. 
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I declare to you, brothers, the 
Gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also 
stand, <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>by which also you are saved, if you 
hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain. <A 
name=C15V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I delivered to you first of all 
that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the 
Scriptures, <A name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that he was buried, that he was raised 
on the third day according to the Scriptures, <A name=C15V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and that he 
appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. <A name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then he appeared to over five hundred 
brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen 
asleep. <A name=C15V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then he appeared to James, then to all 
the apostles, <A name=C15V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and last of all, as to the child born 
at the wrong time, he appeared to me also. <A name=C15V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I am the least 
of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted 
the assembly of God. <A name=C15V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But by the grace of God I am what I 
am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than 
all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. <A 
name=C15V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whether then it is I or they, so we 
preach, and so you believed. 
<P><A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now if Christ is preached, that he has 
been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no 
resurrection of the dead? <A name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if there is no resurrection of the 
dead, neither has Christ been raised. <A name=C15V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If Christ has not been raised, then 
our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain. <A name=C15V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yes, we are found 
false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, 
whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised. <A 
name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the dead aren't raised, neither 
has Christ been raised. <A name=C15V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If Christ has not been raised, your 
faith is vain; you are still in your sins. <A name=C15V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they also who 
are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. <A name=C15V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If we have only 
hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable. 
<P><A name=C15V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now Christ has been raised from 
the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep. <A 
name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For since death came by man, the 
resurrection of the dead also came by man. <A name=C15V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as in Adam all 
die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. <A name=C15V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But each in his 
own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming. 
<A name=C15V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the end comes, when he will 
deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all 
rule and all authority and power. <A name=C15V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he must reign until he has put all 
his enemies under his feet. <A name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The last enemy that will be abolished 
is death. <A name=C15V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For, "He put all things in subjection 
under his feet." But when he says, "All things are put in subjection," it is 
evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him. <A 
name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When all things have been subjected to 
him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things 
to him, that God may be all in all. <A name=C15V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or else what will they do who are 
baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they 
baptized for the dead? <A name=C15V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every 
hour? <A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I affirm, by the boasting in you which 
I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. <A name=C15V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If I fought with 
animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are 
not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." <A 
name=C15V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't be deceived! "Evil 
companionships corrupt good morals." <A name=C15V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wake up righteously, and don't sin, 
for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. <A 
name=C15V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But someone will say, "How are the 
dead raised?" and, "With what kind of body do they come?" <A name=C15V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You foolish one, 
that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies. <A 
name=C15V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That which you sow, you don't sow the 
body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind. <A 
name=C15V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But God gives it a body even as it 
pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own. <A name=C15V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All flesh is not 
the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another 
of fish, and another of birds. <A name=C15V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There are also celestial bodies, and 
terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the 
terrestrial. <A name=C15V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There is one glory of the sun, another

another star in glory. <A name=C15V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. <A name=C15V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is sown a 
natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there 
is also a spiritual body. 
<P><A name=C15V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So also it is written, "The first man, 
Adam, became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. <A 
name=C15V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>However that which is spiritual isn't 
first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual. <A 
name=C15V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The first man is of the earth, made of 
dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven. <A name=C15V48><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As is the one made 
of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such 
are they also that are heavenly. <A name=C15V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As we have borne the image of those 
made of dust, <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N4">let's</A> 
also bear the image of the heavenly. <A name=C15V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I say this, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N5">brothers,</A> that flesh and 
blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit 
incorruption. 
<P><A name=C15V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will 
not all sleep, but we will all be changed, <A name=C15V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in a moment, in 
the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and 
the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed. <A 
name=C15V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this corruptible must put on 
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. <A name=C15V54><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when this 
corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on 
immortality, then what is written will happen: "Death is swallowed up in 
victory." 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Death, where is your 
sting?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hades, where is your victory?" 
<P><A name=C15V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sting of death is sin, and the 
power of sin is the law. <A name=C15V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But thanks be to God, who gives us the 
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <A name=C15V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be 
steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that 
your labor is not in vain in the Lord. 
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now concerning the collection for the 
saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise. <A 
name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On 
the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no 
collections be made when I come. <A name=C16V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I arrive, I will send whoever you 
approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem. <A 
name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If 
it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me. <A name=C16V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I will come to 
you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia. <A 
name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But with you it may be that I will 
stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go. <A 
name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I do not wish to see you now in 
passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits. <A 
name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I will stay at Ephesus until 
Pentecost, <A name=C16V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for a great and effective door has 
opened to me, and there are many adversaries. <A name=C16V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now if Timothy 
comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, 
as I also do. <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let no one despise him. But 
set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect 
him with the brothers. 
<P><A name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I 
strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his 
desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity. 
<P><A name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be 
courageous! Be strong! <A name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let all that you do be done in love. 
<P><A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I beg you, brothers (you know the 
house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have 
set themselves to minister to the saints), <A name=C16V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that you also be 
in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. <A 
name=C16V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, 
Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they 
supplied. <A name=C16V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they refreshed my spirit and 
yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that. 
<P><A name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The assemblies of Asia greet you. 
Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that 
is in their house. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All the brothers greet you. Greet one 
another with a holy kiss. 
<P><A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This greeting is by me, Paul, with my 
own hand. <A name=C16V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus 
Christ, let him be <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N6">accursed</A>. <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/1Cor.htm#N7">Come, Lord!</A> <A 
name=C16V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you. <A name=C16V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. 
Amen.
