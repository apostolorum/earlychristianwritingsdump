<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Acts</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all 
that Jesus began both to do and teach,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Until the day in which he 
was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto 
the apostles whom he had chosen:<BR>[<B>3</B>] To whom also he shewed himself 
alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty 
days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not 
depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, 
ye have heard of me.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For John truly baptized with water; but ye 
shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<BR>[<B>6</B>] When 
they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at 
this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he said unto 
them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath 
put in his own power.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But ye shall receive power, after that the 
Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in 
Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the 
earth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he 
was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And 
while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood 
by them in white apparel;<BR>[<B>11</B>] Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why 
stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into 
heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into 
heaven.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called 
Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And when 
they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and 
James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James 
the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of 
James.<BR>[<B>14</B>] These all continued with one accord in prayer and 
supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his 
brethren.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the 
disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and 
twenty,)<BR>[<B>16</B>] Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been 
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning 
Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For he was 
numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Now 
this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he 
burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And it 
was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called 
in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of 
blood.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his 
habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let 
another take.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Wherefore of these men which have companied with us 
all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from 
us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his 
resurrection.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who 
was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And they prayed, and said, 
Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou 
hast chosen,<BR>[<B>25</B>] That he may take part of this ministry and 
apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own 
place.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon 
Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they 
were all with one accord in one place.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And suddenly there came a 
sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where 
they were sitting.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And there appeared unto them cloven tongues 
like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And they were all 
filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit 
gave them utterance.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, 
devout men, out of every nation under heaven.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Now when this was 
noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that 
every man heard them speak in his own language.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they were all 
amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which 
speak Galilaeans?<BR>[<B>8</B>] And how hear we every man in our own tongue, 
wherein we were born?<BR>[<B>9</B>] Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the 
dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and 
Asia,<BR>[<B>10</B>] Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya 
about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,<BR>[<B>11</B>] Cretes 
and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of 
God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to 
another, What meaneth this?<BR>[<B>13</B>] Others mocking said, These men are 
full of new wine.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted 
up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at 
Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:<BR>[<B>15</B>] For 
these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the 
day.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But this is that which was spoken by the prophet 
Joel;<BR>[<B>17</B>] And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,I 
will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters 
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall 
dream dreams:<BR>[<B>18</B>] And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will 
pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:<BR>[<B>19</B>] And 
I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and 
fire, and vapour of smoke:<BR>[<B>20</B>] The sun shall be turned into darkness, 
and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord 
come:<BR>[<B>21</B>] And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the 
name of the Lord shall be saved.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Ye men of Israel, hear these 
words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and 
wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves 
also know:<BR>[<B>23</B>] Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and 
foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and 
slain:<BR>[<B>24</B>] Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: 
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.<BR>[<B>25</B>] For 
David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he 
is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:<BR>[<B>26</B>] Therefore did my 
heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in 
hope:<BR>[<B>27</B>] Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt 
thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Thou hast made 
known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy 
countenance.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of 
the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with 
us unto this day.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God 
had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the 
flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;<BR>[<B>31</B>] He seeing 
this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in 
hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.<BR>[<B>32</B>] This Jesus hath God 
raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Therefore being by the 
right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the 
Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.<BR>[<B>34</B>] 
For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said 
unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<BR>[<B>35</B>] Until I make thy foes 
thy footstool.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Therefore let all the house of Israel know 
assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord 
and Christ.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their 
heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, 
what shall we do?<BR>[<B>38</B>] Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be 
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, 
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>39</B>] For the promise 
is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as 
the Lord our God shall call.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And with many other words did he 
testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward 
generation.<BR>[<B>41</B>] Then they that gladly received his word were 
baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand 
souls.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine 
and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And 
fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the 
apostles.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And all that believed were together, and had all things 
common;<BR>[<B>45</B>] And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to 
all men, as every man had need.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And they, continuing daily with 
one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their 
meat with gladness and singleness of heart,<BR>[<B>47</B>] Praising God, and 
having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such 
as should be saved.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at 
the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And a certain man lame 
from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the 
temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the 
temple;<BR>[<B>3</B>] Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple 
asked an alms.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, 
said, Look on us.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive 
something of them.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; 
but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up 
and walk.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: 
and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And he 
leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, 
and leaping, and praising God.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And all the people saw him walking 
and praising God:<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they knew that it was he which sat for alms 
at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and 
amazement at that which had happened unto him.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And as the lame 
man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them 
in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye 
at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or 
holiness we had made this man to walk?<BR>[<B>13</B>] The God of Abraham, and of 
Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom 
ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was 
determined to let him go.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But ye denied the Holy One and the 
Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;<BR>[<B>15</B>] And killed 
the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are 
witnesses.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And his name through faith in his name hath made this 
man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him 
this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And now, 
brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your 
rulers.<BR>[<B>18</B>] But those things, which God before had shewed by the 
mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so 
fulfilled.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins 
may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of 
the Lord;<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was 
preached unto you:<BR>[<B>21</B>] Whom the heaven must receive until the times 
of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy 
prophets since the world began.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For Moses truly said unto the 
fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, 
like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto 
you.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not 
hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Yea, 
and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have 
spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Ye are the children 
of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying 
unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be 
blessed.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent 
him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and 
the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the 
resurrection from the dead.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And they laid hands on them, and put 
them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Howbeit 
many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about 
five thousand.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And it came to pass on the morrow, that their 
rulers, and elders, and scribes,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And Annas the high priest, and 
Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the 
high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when they 
had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye 
done this?<BR>[<B>8</B>] Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, 
Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,<BR>[<B>9</B>] If we this day be 
examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made 
whole;<BR>[<B>10</B>] Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, 
that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised 
from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you 
whole.<BR>[<B>11</B>] This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, 
which is become the head of the corner.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Neither is there 
salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among 
men, whereby we must be saved.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Now when they saw the boldness of 
Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they 
marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, 
they could say nothing against it.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But when they had commanded 
them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among 
themselves,<BR>[<B>16</B>] Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that 
indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that 
dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But that it spread no 
further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak 
henceforth to no man in this name.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And they called them, and 
commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it 
be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge 
ye.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and 
heard.<BR>[<B>21</B>] So when they had further threatened them, they let them 
go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all 
men glorified God for that which was done.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For the man was above 
forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And 
being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief 
priests and elders had said unto them.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when they heard that, 
they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, 
which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them 
is:<BR>[<B>25</B>] Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the 
heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?<BR>[<B>26</B>] The kings of 
the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and 
against his Christ.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, 
whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and 
the people of Israel, were gathered together,<BR>[<B>28</B>] For to do 
whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.<BR>[<B>29</B>] 
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with 
all boldness they may speak thy word,<BR>[<B>30</B>] By stretching forth thine 
hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy 
child Jesus.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where 
they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and 
they spake the word of God with boldness.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And the multitude of 
them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them 
that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things 
common.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And with great power gave the apostles witness of the 
resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them 
all.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as 
were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the 
things that were sold,<BR>[<B>35</B>] And laid them down at the apostles' feet: 
and distribution was made unto every man according as he had 
need.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, 
(which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the 
country of Cyprus,<BR>[<B>37</B>] Having land, sold it, and brought the money, 
and laid it at the apostles' feet.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his 
wife, sold a possession,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And kept back part of the price, his wife 
also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' 
feet.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart 
to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the 
land?<BR>[<B>4</B>] Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was 
sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine 
heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And Ananias 
hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all 
them that heard these things.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the young men arose, wound him 
up, and carried him out, and buried him.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And it was about the 
space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came 
in.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land 
for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then Peter said unto 
her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? 
behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and 
shall carry thee out.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Then fell she down straightway at his feet, 
and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, 
carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And great fear 
came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the 
people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified 
them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes 
both of men and women.)<BR>[<B>15</B>] Insomuch that they brought forth the sick 
into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the 
shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] There 
came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing 
sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed 
every one.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were 
with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with 
indignation,<BR>[<B>18</B>] And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them 
in the common prison.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But the angel of the Lord by night opened 
the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,<BR>[<B>20</B>] Go, stand and 
speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And 
when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and 
taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the 
council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the 
prison to have them brought.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But when the officers came, and 
found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,<BR>[<B>23</B>] Saying, 
The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without 
before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.<BR>[<B>24</B>] 
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests 
heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would 
grow.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom 
ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the 
people.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them 
without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been 
stoned.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And when they had brought them, they set them before the 
council: and the high priest asked them,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Saying, Did not we 
straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have 
filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon 
us.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought 
to obey God rather than men.<BR>[<B>30</B>] The God of our fathers raised up 
Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Him hath God exalted 
with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to 
Israel, and forgiveness of sins.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And we are his witnesses of 
these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that 
obey him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and 
took counsel to slay them.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Then stood there up one in the 
council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation 
among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little 
space;<BR>[<B>35</B>] And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to 
yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.<BR>[<B>36</B>] For before 
these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of 
men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as 
obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.<BR>[<B>37</B>] After this man 
rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people 
after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were 
dispersed.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and 
let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to 
nought:<BR>[<B>39</B>] But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply 
ye be found even to fight against God.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And to him they agreed: 
and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they 
should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And they 
departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted 
worthy to suffer shame for his name.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And daily in the temple, and 
in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] And in those days, when the number of the disciples 
was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, 
because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is 
not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of 
the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the 
word.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose 
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, 
and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of 
Antioch:<BR>[<B>6</B>] Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had 
prayed, they laid their hands on them.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the word of God 
increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and 
a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the 
people.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called 
the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of 
Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they were not 
able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Then 
they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against 
Moses, and against God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they stirred up the people, and the 
elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to 
the council,<BR>[<B>13</B>] And set up false witnesses, which said, This man 
ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the 
law:<BR>[<B>14</B>] For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall 
destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered 
us.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, 
saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then said the high priest, Are these things 
so?<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of 
glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he 
dwelt in Charran,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, 
and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew 
thee.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in 
Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this 
land, wherein ye now dwell.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he gave him none inheritance in 
it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it 
to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no 
child.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in 
a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them 
evil four hundred years.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the nation to whom they shall be in 
bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve 
me in this place.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: 
and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat 
Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the patriarchs, 
moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in 
the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all 
his house.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and 
Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no 
sustenance.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he 
sent out our fathers first.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And at the second time Joseph was 
made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto 
Pharaoh.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, 
and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.<BR>[<B>15</B>] So Jacob went 
down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,<BR>[<B>16</B>] And were carried 
over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of 
money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But when the 
time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew 
and multiplied in Egypt,<BR>[<B>18</B>] Till another king arose, which knew not 
Joseph.<BR>[<B>19</B>] The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil 
entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end 
they might not live.<BR>[<B>20</B>] In which time Moses was born, and was 
exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three 
months:<BR>[<B>21</B>] And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, 
and nourished him for her own son.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And Moses was learned in all 
the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in 
deeds.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when he was full forty years old, it came into his 
heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And seeing 
one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, 
and smote the Egyptian:<BR>[<B>25</B>] For he supposed his brethren would have 
understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood 
not.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, 
and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye 
wrong one to another?<BR>[<B>27</B>] But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust 
him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?<BR>[<B>28</B>] Wilt 
thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then fled 
Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat 
two sons.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And when forty years were expired, there appeared to 
him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a 
bush.<BR>[<B>31</B>] When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew 
near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,<BR>[<B>32</B>] Saying, I 
am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abrham, and the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Then said 
the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou 
standest is holy ground.<BR>[<B>34</B>] I have seen, I have seen the affliction 
of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come 
down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the 
same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which 
appeared to him in the bush.<BR>[<B>36</B>] He brought them out, after that he 
had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in 
the wilderness forty years.<BR>[<B>37</B>] This is that Moses, which said unto 
the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of 
your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.<BR>[<B>38</B>] This is he, that 
was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the 
mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto 
us:<BR>[<B>39</B>] To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, 
and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,<BR>[<B>40</B>] Saying unto 
Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out 
of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And they 
made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in 
the works of their own hands.<BR>[<B>42</B>] Then God turned, and gave them up 
to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O 
ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the 
space of forty years in the wilderness?<BR>[<B>43</B>] Yea, ye took up the 
tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to 
worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.<BR>[<B>44</B>] Our 
fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, 
speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had 
seen.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Which also our fathers that came after brought in with 
Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of 
our fathers, unto the days of David;<BR>[<B>46</B>] Who found favour before God, 
and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.<BR>[<B>47</B>] But 
Solomon built him an house.<BR>[<B>48</B>] Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in 
temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,<BR>[<B>49</B>] Heaven is my 
throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: 
or what is the place of my rest?<BR>[<B>50</B>] Hath not my hand made all these 
things?<BR>[<B>51</B>] Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do 
always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.<BR>[<B>52</B>] 
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them 
which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the 
betrayers and murderers:<BR>[<B>53</B>] Who have received the law by the 
disposition of angels, and have not kept it.<BR>[<B>54</B>] When they heard 
these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their 
teeth.<BR>[<B>55</B>] But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly 
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of 
God,<BR>[<B>56</B>] And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of 
man standing on the right hand of God.<BR>[<B>57</B>] Then they cried out with a 
loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one 
accord,<BR>[<B>58</B>] And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the 
witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was 
Saul.<BR>[<B>59</B>] And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord 
Jesus, receive my spirit.<BR>[<B>60</B>] And he kneeled down, and cried with a 
loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, 
he fell asleep.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that 
time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; 
and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, 
except the apostles.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, 
and made great lamentation over him.<BR>[<B>3</B>] As for Saul, he made havock 
of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed 
them to prison.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Therefore they that were scattered abroad went 
every where preaching the word.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Then Philip went down to the city 
of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the people with one 
accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the 
miracles which he did.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For unclean spirits, crying with loud 
voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with 
palsies, and that were lame, were healed.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And there was great joy 
in that city.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But there was a certain man, called Simon, which 
beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, 
giving out that himself was some great one:<BR>[<B>10</B>] To whom they all gave 
heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of 
God.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had 
bewitched them with sorceries.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But when they believed Philip 
preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus 
Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then Simon 
himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and 
wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Now 
when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the 
word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<BR>[<B>15</B>] Who, when they 
were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy 
Ghost:<BR>[<B>16</B>] (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they 
were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<BR>[<B>17</B>] Then laid they 
their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And when 
Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was 
given, he offered them money,<BR>[<B>19</B>] Saying, Give me also this power, 
that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought 
that the gift of God may be purchased with money.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Thou hast 
neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of 
God.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if 
perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<BR>[<B>23</B>] For I 
perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of 
iniquity.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for 
me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to 
Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the 
Samaritans.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, 
Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto 
Gaza, which is desert.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he arose and went: and, behold, a man 
of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, 
who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to 
worship,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias 
the prophet.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join 
thyself to this chariot.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Philip ran thither to him, and heard 
him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou 
readest?<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? 
And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.<BR>[<B>32</B>] The 
place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the 
slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his 
mouth:<BR>[<B>33</B>] In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who 
shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the 
earth.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of 
whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto 
him Jesus.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And as they went on their way, they came unto a 
certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to 
be baptized?<BR>[<B>37</B>] And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine 
heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the 
Son of God.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they 
went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized 
him.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of 
the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his 
way rejoicing.<BR>[<B>40</B>] But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing 
through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter 
against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And 
desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of 
this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and 
suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he 
fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord 
said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the 
pricks.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou 
have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it 
shall be told thee what thou must do.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the men which journeyed 
with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but 
they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he 
was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And 
there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the 
Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called 
Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, 
behold, he prayeth,<BR>[<B>12</B>] And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias 
coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his 
sight.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this 
man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy 
name.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen 
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children 
of Israel:<BR>[<B>16</B>] For I will shew him how great things he must suffer 
for my name's sake.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And Ananias went his way, and entered into 
the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even 
Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that 
thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy 
Ghost.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been 
scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was 
baptized.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. 
Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at 
Damascus.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, 
that he is the Son of God.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But all that heard him were amazed, 
and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in 
Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto 
the chief priests?<BR>[<B>22</B>] But Saul increased the more in strength, and 
confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very 
Christ.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took 
counsel to kill him:<BR>[<B>24</B>] But their laying await was known of Saul. 
And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then the 
disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a 
basket.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join 
himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that 
he was a disciple.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the 
apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that 
he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And he was with them coming in and going out at 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and 
disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.<BR>[<B>30</B>] 
Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him 
forth to Tarsus.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea 
and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, 
and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And it 
came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the 
saints which dwelt at Lydda.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And there he found a certain man 
named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the 
palsy.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee 
whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And all 
that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation 
is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she 
did.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and 
died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper 
chamber.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the 
disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring 
him that he would not delay to come to them.<BR>[<B>39</B>] Then Peter arose and 
went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and 
all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which 
Dorcas made, while she was with them.<BR>[<B>40</B>] But Peter put them all 
forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, 
arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat 
up.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had 
called the saints and widows, presented her alive.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And it was 
known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And it 
came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, 
a centurion of the band called the Italian band,<BR>[<B>2</B>] A devout man, and 
one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and 
prayed to God alway.<BR>[<B>3</B>] He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth 
hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, 
Cornelius.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, 
What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up 
for a memorial before God.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And now send men to Joppa, and call for 
one Simon, whose surname is Peter:<BR>[<B>6</B>] He lodgeth with one Simon a 
tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to 
do.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he 
called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited 
on him continually;<BR>[<B>8</B>] And when he had declared all these things unto 
them, he sent them to Joppa.<BR>[<B>9</B>] On the morrow, as they went on their 
journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray 
about the sixth hour:<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he became very hungry, and would have 
eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,<BR>[<B>11</B>] And saw 
heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great 
sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and 
creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And there came a voice to 
him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But Peter said, Not so, Lord; 
for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that 
call not thou common.<BR>[<B>16</B>] This was done thrice: and the vessel was 
received up again into heaven.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Now while Peter doubted in himself 
what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent 
from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the 
gate,<BR>[<B>18</B>] And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed 
Peter, were lodged there.<BR>[<B>19</B>] While Peter thought on the vision, the 
Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Arise 
therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have 
sent them.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto 
him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause 
wherefore ye are come?<BR>[<B>22</B>] And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a 
just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of 
the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, 
and to hear words of thee.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Then called he them in, and lodged 
them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from 
Joppa accompanied him.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And the morrow after they entered into 
Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and 
near friends.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and 
fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But Peter took him up, 
saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And as he talked with 
him, he went in, and found many that were come together.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And he 
said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew 
to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that 
I should not call any man common or unclean.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Therefore came I 
unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what 
intent ye have sent for me?<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Cornelius said, Four days ago I 
was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, 
behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,<BR>[<B>31</B>] And said, 
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the 
sight of God.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, 
whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the 
sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Immediately 
therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now 
therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are 
commanded thee of God.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of 
a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:<BR>[<B>35</B>] But in 
every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with 
him.<BR>[<B>36</B>] The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, 
preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)<BR>[<B>37</B>] That word, 
I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from 
Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;<BR>[<B>38</B>] How God anointed 
Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, 
and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with 
him.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the 
land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a 
tree:<BR>[<B>40</B>] Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him 
openly;<BR>[<B>41</B>] Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before 
of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the 
dead.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to 
testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and 
dead.<BR>[<B>43</B>] To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name 
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.<BR>[<B>44</B>] While 
Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the 
word.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And they of the circumcision which believed were 
astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was 
poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>46</B>] For they heard them speak 
with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,<BR>[<B>47</B>] Can any man 
forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy 
Ghost as well as we?<BR>[<B>48</B>] And he commanded them to be baptized in the 
name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea 
heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And 
when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision 
contended with him,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, 
and didst eat with them.<BR>[<B>4</B>] But Peter rehearsed the matter from the 
beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,<BR>[<B>5</B>] I was in 
the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel 
descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and 
it came even to me:<BR>[<B>6</B>] Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, 
I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and 
creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And I heard a voice saying 
unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But I said, Not so, Lord: for 
nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call 
not thou common.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And this was done three times: and all were 
drawn up again into heaven.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And, behold, immediately there were 
three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto 
me.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. 
Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's 
house:<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, 
which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose 
surname is Peter;<BR>[<B>14</B>] Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all 
thy house shall be saved.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost 
fell on them, as on us at the beginning.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then remembered I the 
word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye 
shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Forasmuch then as God gave 
them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; 
what was I, that I could withstand God?<BR>[<B>18</B>] When they heard these 
things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to 
the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Now they which were 
scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far 
as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the 
Jews only.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, 
when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number 
believed, and turned unto the Lord.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then tidings of these things 
came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth 
Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Who, when he came, 
and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with 
purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For he was a 
good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added 
unto the Lord.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek 
Saul:<BR>[<B>26</B>] And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And 
it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, 
and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in 
Antioch.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto 
Antioch.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and 
signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the 
world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then 
the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief 
unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:<BR>[<B>30</B>] Which also they did, and 
sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth 
his hands to vex certain of the church.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he killed James the 
brother of John with the sword.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And because he saw it pleased the 
Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened 
bread.)<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and 
delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after 
Easter to bring him forth to the people.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Peter therefore was kept 
in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for 
him.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night 
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers 
before the door kept the prison.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And, behold, the angel of the 
Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the 
side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from 
his hands.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on 
thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, 
and follow me.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he went out, and followed him; and wist not 
that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a 
vision.<BR>[<B>10</B>] When they were past the first and the second ward, they 
came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his 
own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith 
the angel departed from him.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And when Peter was come to himself, 
he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath 
delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the 
people of the Jews.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when he had considered the thing, he came 
to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were 
gathered together praying.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And as Peter knocked at the door of 
the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when she 
knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told 
how Peter stood before the gate.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And they said unto her, Thou art 
mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his 
angel.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the 
door, and saw him, they were astonished.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But he, beckoning unto 
them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had 
brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and 
to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was 
become of Peter.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when Herod had sought for him, and found him 
not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. 
And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one 
accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, 
desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's 
country.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat 
upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the people 
gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.<BR>[<B>23</B>] 
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the 
glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But the 
word of God grew and multiplied.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And Barnabas and Saul returned 
from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, 
whose surname was Mark.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now there were in the church that was at Antioch 
certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, 
and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the 
tetrarch, and Saul.<BR>[<B>2</B>] As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, 
the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have 
called them.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their 
hands on them, they sent them away.<BR>[<B>4</B>] So they, being sent forth by 
the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to 
Cyprus.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of 
God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their 
minister.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, 
they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was 
Bar-jesus:<BR>[<B>7</B>] Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius 
Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the 
word of God.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by 
interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the 
faith.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy 
Ghost, set his eyes on him,<BR>[<B>10</B>] And said, O full of all subtilty and 
all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt 
thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?<BR>[<B>11</B>] And now, 
behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing 
the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; 
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then the 
deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of 
the Lord.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they 
came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But when they departed from Perga, they came to 
Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat 
down.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And after the reading of the law and the prophets the 
rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have 
any word of exhortation for the people, say on.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then Paul stood 
up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give 
audience.<BR>[<B>17</B>] The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and 
exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with 
an high arm brought he them out of it.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And about the time of 
forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when 
he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to 
them by lot.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And after that he gave unto them judges about the 
space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a 
man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And 
when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom 
also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man 
after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Of this 
man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, 
Jesus:<BR>[<B>24</B>] When John had first preached before his coming the baptism 
of repentance to all the people of Israel.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And as John fulfilled 
his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there 
cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to 
loose.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and 
whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation 
sent.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because 
they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every 
sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And 
though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he 
should be slain.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And when they had fulfilled all that was written 
of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a 
sepulchre.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But God raised him from the dead:<BR>[<B>31</B>] And 
he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, 
who are his witnesses unto the people.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And we declare unto you 
glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the 
fathers,<BR>[<B>33</B>] God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in 
that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, 
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And as concerning 
that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he 
said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One 
to see corruption.<BR>[<B>36</B>] For David, after he had served his own 
generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and 
saw corruption:<BR>[<B>37</B>] But he, whom God raised again, saw no 
corruption.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, 
that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of 
sins:<BR>[<B>39</B>] And by him all that believe are justified from all things, 
from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.<BR>[<B>40</B>] Beware 
therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the 
prophets;<BR>[<B>41</B>] Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I 
work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man 
declare it unto you.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And when the Jews were gone out of the 
synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the 
next sabbath.<BR>[<B>43</B>] Now when the congregation was broken up, many of 
the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to 
them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And the 
next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of 
God.<BR>[<B>45</B>] But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with 
envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting 
and blaspheming.<BR>[<B>46</B>] Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It 
was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but 
seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, 
lo, we turn to the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>47</B>] For so hath the Lord commanded us, 
saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be 
for salvation unto the ends of the earth.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And when the Gentiles 
heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as 
were ordained to eternal life believed.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And the word of the Lord 
was published throughout all the region.<BR>[<B>50</B>] But the Jews stirred up 
the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised 
persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their 
coasts.<BR>[<B>51</B>] But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, 
and came unto Iconium.<BR>[<B>52</B>] And the disciples were filled with joy, 
and with the Holy Ghost.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both 
together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude 
both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.<BR>[<B>2</B>] But the 
unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected 
against the brethren.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Long time therefore abode they speaking 
boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted 
signs and wonders to be done by their hands.<BR>[<B>4</B>] But the multitude of 
the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the 
apostles.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, 
and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone 
them,<BR>[<B>6</B>] They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities 
of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:<BR>[<B>7</B>] And there 
they preached the gospel.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And there sat a certain man at Lystra, 
impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had 
walked:<BR>[<B>9</B>] The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, 
and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,<BR>[<B>10</B>] Said with a loud 
voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And 
when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in 
the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of 
men.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, 
because he was the chief speaker.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then the priest of Jupiter, 
which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would 
have done sacrifice with the people.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Which when the apostles, 
Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the 
people, crying out,<BR>[<B>15</B>] And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We 
also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn 
from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the 
sea, and all things that are therein:<BR>[<B>16</B>] Who in times past suffered 
all nations to walk in their own ways.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Nevertheless he left not 
himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and 
fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And 
with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done 
sacrifice unto them.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And there came thither certain Jews from 
Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him 
out of the city, supposing he had been dead.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Howbeit, as the 
disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the 
next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And when they had 
preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to 
Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,<BR>[<B>22</B>] Confirming the souls of the 
disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through 
much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when they had 
ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they 
commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And after they 
had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And when 
they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace 
of God for the work which they fulfilled.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And when they were 
come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done 
with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the 
Gentiles.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And there they abode long time with the disciples.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] And certain men which came down from Judaea taught 
the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye 
cannot be saved.<BR>[<B>2</B>] When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small 
dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, 
and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and 
elders about this question.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And being brought on their way by the 
church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the 
Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And 
when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the 
apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with 
them.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which 
believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to 
keep the law of Moses.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the apostles and elders came together 
for to consider of this matter.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when there had been much 
disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that 
a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should 
hear the word of the gospel, and believe.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And God, which knoweth 
the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto 
us;<BR>[<B>9</B>] And put no difference between us and them, purifying their 
hearts by faith.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke 
upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to 
bear?<BR>[<B>11</B>] But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus 
Christ we shall be saved, even as they.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then all the multitude 
kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles 
and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And after 
they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken 
unto me:<BR>[<B>14</B>] Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the 
Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And to this 
agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,<BR>[<B>16</B>] After this I 
will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; 
and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:<BR>[<B>17</B>] 
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon 
whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these 
things.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of 
the world.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, 
which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:<BR>[<B>20</B>] But that we 
write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from 
fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.<BR>[<B>21</B>] For Moses 
of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the 
synagogues every sabbath day.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then pleased it the apostles and 
elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to 
Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, 
chief men among the brethren:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And they wrote letters by them 
after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the 
brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and 
Cilicia:<BR>[<B>24</B>] Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out 
from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be 
circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such 
commandment:<BR>[<B>25</B>] It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one 
accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and 
Paul,<BR>[<B>26</B>] Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord 
Jesus Christ.<BR>[<B>27</B>] We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall 
also tell you the same things by mouth.<BR>[<B>28</B>] For it seemed good to the 
Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary 
things;<BR>[<B>29</B>] That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from 
blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep 
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.<BR>[<B>30</B>] So when they were 
dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude 
together, they delivered the epistle:<BR>[<B>31</B>] Which when they had read, 
they rejoiced for the consolation.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And Judas and Silas, being 
prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed 
them.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go 
in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Notwithstanding it 
pleased Silas to abide there still.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Paul also and Barnabas 
continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many 
others also.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us 
go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of 
the Lord, and see how they do.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And Barnabas determined to take 
with them John, whose surname was Mark.<BR>[<B>38</B>] But Paul thought not good 
to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with 
them to the work.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And the contention was so sharp between them, 
that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and 
sailed unto Cyprus;<BR>[<B>40</B>] And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being 
recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And he went 
through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a 
certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which 
was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:<BR>[<B>2</B>] Which was 
well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because 
of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was 
a Greek.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And as they went through the cities, they delivered them 
the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which 
were at Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And so were the churches established in the 
faith, and increased in number daily.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Now when they had gone 
throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy 
Ghost to preach the word in Asia,<BR>[<B>7</B>] After they were come to Mysia, 
they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them 
not.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and 
prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And 
after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, 
assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto 
them.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight 
course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;<BR>[<B>12</B>] And from 
thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a 
colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And on the 
sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be 
made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted 
thither.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of 
the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord 
opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of 
Paul.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought 
us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, 
and abide there. And she constrained us.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And it came to pass, as 
we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met 
us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:<BR>[<B>17</B>] The same 
followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most 
high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And this did 
she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command 
thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same 
hour.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was 
gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the 
rulers,<BR>[<B>20</B>] And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, 
being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,<BR>[<B>21</B>] And teach customs, 
which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being 
Romans.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the multitude rose up together against them: and the 
magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.<BR>[<B>23</B>] 
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, 
charging the jailor to keep them safely:<BR>[<B>24</B>] Who, having received 
such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in 
the stocks.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang 
praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And suddenly 
there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: 
and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were 
loosed.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, 
and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed 
himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But Paul 
cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all 
here.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came 
trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,<BR>[<B>30</B>] And brought them 
out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?<BR>[<B>31</B>] And they said, 
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy 
house.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all 
that were in his house.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he took them the same hour of the 
night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, 
straightway.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And when he had brought them into his house, he set 
meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his 
house.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, 
saying, Let those men go.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And the keeper of the prison told this 
saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, 
and go in peace.<BR>[<B>37</B>] But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us 
openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they 
thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us 
out.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and 
they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And they came 
and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the 
city.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house 
of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and 
departed.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.17</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and 
Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the 
Jews:<BR>[<B>2</B>] And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three 
sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Opening and 
alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; 
and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And some 
of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a 
great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But the Jews 
which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the 
baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and 
assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the 
people.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain 
brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world 
upside down are come hither also;<BR>[<B>7</B>] Whom Jason hath received: and 
these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another 
king, one Jesus.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they troubled the people and the rulers of 
the city, when they heard these things.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when they had taken 
security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the 
brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming 
thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.<BR>[<B>11</B>] These were more 
noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all 
readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were 
so.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women 
which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But when the Jews of 
Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, 
they came thither also, and stirred up the people.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And then 
immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas 
and Timotheus abode there still.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And they that conducted Paul 
brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus 
for to come to him with all speed, they departed.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Now while Paul 
waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city 
wholly given to idolatry.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Therefore disputed he in the synagogue 
with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them 
that met with him.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, 
and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? 
other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached 
unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And they took him, and 
brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof 
thou speakest, is?<BR>[<B>20</B>] For thou bringest certain strange things to 
our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.<BR>[<B>21</B>] (For 
all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing 
else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then Paul 
stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in 
all things ye are too superstitious.<BR>[<B>23</B>] For as I passed by, and 
beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN 
GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto 
you.<BR>[<B>24</B>] God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that 
he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with 
hands;<BR>[<B>25</B>] Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he 
needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all 
things;<BR>[<B>26</B>] And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to 
dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before 
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;<BR>[<B>27</B>] That they should 
seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be 
not far from every one of us:<BR>[<B>28</B>] For in him we live, and move, and 
have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his 
offspring.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we 
ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, 
graven by art and man's device.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And the times of this ignorance 
God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:<BR>[<B>31</B>] 
Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in 
righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance 
unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And when 
they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We 
will hear thee again of this matter.<BR>[<B>33</B>] So Paul departed from among 
them.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the 
which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with 
them.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.18</H3>[<B>1</B>] After these things Paul departed from Athens, and 
came to Corinth;<BR>[<B>2</B>] And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in 
Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius 
had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by 
their occupation they were tentmakers.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he reasoned in the 
synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the 
spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when 
they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto 
them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go 
unto the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he departed thence, and entered into a 
certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined 
hard to the synagogue.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And Crispus, the chief ruler of the 
synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians 
hearing believed, and were baptized.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then spake the Lord to Paul 
in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy 
peace:<BR>[<B>10</B>] For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt 
thee: for I have much people in this city.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he continued there 
a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord 
against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,<BR>[<B>13</B>] Saying, This 
fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were 
a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear 
with you:<BR>[<B>15</B>] But if it be a question of words and names, and of your 
law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And 
he drave them from the judgment seat.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Then all the Greeks took 
Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment 
seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Paul after 
this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, 
and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn 
his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he came to Ephesus, 
and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned 
with the Jews.<BR>[<B>20</B>] When they desired him to tarry longer time with 
them, he consented not;<BR>[<B>21</B>] But bade them farewell, saying, I must by 
all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto 
you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And when he had 
landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to 
Antioch.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and 
went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the 
disciples.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, 
an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, 
he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism 
of John.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when 
Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him 
the way of God more perfectly.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And when he was disposed to pass 
into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, 
when he was come, helped them much which had believed through 
grace:<BR>[<B>28</B>] For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, 
shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.19</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at 
Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and 
finding certain disciples,<BR>[<B>2</B>] He said unto them, Have ye received the 
Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as 
heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he said unto them, Unto 
what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto 
the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that 
is, on Christ Jesus.<BR>[<B>5</B>] When they heard this, they were baptized in 
the name of the Lord Jesus.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when Paul had laid his hands upon 
them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and 
prophesied.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And all the men were about twelve.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, 
disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way 
before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, 
disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And this continued 
by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word 
of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And God wrought special 
miracles by the hands of Paul:<BR>[<B>12</B>] So that from his body were brought 
unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and 
the evil spirits went out of them.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then certain of the vagabond 
Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the 
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul 
preacheth.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and 
chief of the priests, which did so.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And the evil spirit answered 
and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the 
man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed 
against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and 
wounded.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also 
dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus 
was magnified.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And many that believed came, and confessed, and 
shewed their deeds.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Many of them also which used curious arts 
brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted 
the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.<BR>[<B>21</B>] After these 
things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through 
Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I 
must also see Rome.<BR>[<B>22</B>] So he sent into Macedonia two of them that 
ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a 
season.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And the same time there arose no small stir about that 
way.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made 
silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the 
craftsmen;<BR>[<B>25</B>] Whom he called together with the workmen of like 
occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our 
wealth.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but 
almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much 
people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:<BR>[<B>27</B>] 
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that 
the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence 
should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And 
when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, 
Great is Diana of the Ephesians.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And the whole city was filled 
with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, 
Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the 
theatre.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the 
disciples suffered him not.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And certain of the chief of Asia, 
which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure 
himself into the theatre.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Some therefore cried one thing, and 
some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not 
wherefore they were come together.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And they drew Alexander out of 
the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the 
hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.<BR>[<B>34</B>] But when 
they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours 
cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And when the 
townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there 
that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great 
goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, 
and to do nothing rashly.<BR>[<B>37</B>] For ye have brought hither these men, 
which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your 
goddess.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with 
him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let 
them implead one another.<BR>[<B>39</B>] But if ye inquire any thing concerning 
other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.<BR>[<B>40</B>] For 
we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no 
cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And when 
he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.20</H3>[<B>1</B>] And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him 
the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into 
Macedonia.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when he had gone over those parts, and had given 
them much exhortation, he came into Greece,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And there abode three 
months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, 
he purposed to return through Macedonia.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And there accompanied him 
into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; 
and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and 
Trophimus.<BR>[<B>5</B>] These going before tarried for us at 
Troas.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of 
unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven 
days.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came 
together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; 
and continued his speech until midnight.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And there were many 
lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into 
a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell 
down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And Paul went 
down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his 
life is in him.<BR>[<B>11</B>] When he therefore was come up again, and had 
broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he 
departed.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they brought the young man alive, and were not a 
little comforted.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And we went before to ship, and sailed unto 
Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself 
to go afoot.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, 
and came to Mitylene.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And we sailed thence, and came the next day 
over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at 
Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.<BR>[<B>16</B>] For Paul had 
determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for 
he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of 
Pentecost.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the 
elders of the church.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And when they were come to him, he said 
unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner 
I have been with you at all seasons,<BR>[<B>19</B>] Serving the Lord with all 
humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the 
lying in wait of the Jews:<BR>[<B>20</B>] And how I kept back nothing that was 
profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and 
from house to house,<BR>[<B>21</B>] Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the 
Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus 
Christ.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, 
not knowing the things that shall befall me there:<BR>[<B>23</B>] Save that the 
Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide 
me.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But none of these things move me, neither count I my life 
dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, 
which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of 
God.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone 
preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all 
men.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel 
of God.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the 
flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church 
of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<BR>[<B>29</B>] For I know 
this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not 
sparing the flock.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Also of your own selves shall men arise, 
speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.<BR>[<B>31</B>] 
Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to 
warn every one night and day with tears.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And now, brethren, I 
commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, 
and to give you an inheritance among all them which are 
sanctified.<BR>[<B>33</B>] I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or 
apparel.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have 
ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.<BR>[<B>35</B>] I 
have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, 
and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to 
give than to receive.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled 
down, and prayed with them all.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And they all wept sore, and fell 
on Paul's neck, and kissed him,<BR>[<B>38</B>] Sorrowing most of all for the 
words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they 
accompanied him unto the ship.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.21</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from 
them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day 
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:<BR>[<B>2</B>] And finding a 
ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into 
Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her 
burden.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who 
said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when we had accomplished those days, we departed 
and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, 
till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and 
prayed.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took 
ship; and they returned home again.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when we had finished our 
course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with 
them one day.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the next day we that were of Paul's company 
departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the 
evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And 
the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And 
as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, 
named Agabus.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's 
girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, 
So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall 
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when we heard 
these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break 
mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem 
for the name of the Lord Jesus.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when he would not be 
persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>16</B>] There went with us also certain of the disciples of 
Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom 
we should lodge.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren 
received us gladly.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the day following Paul went in with us 
unto James; and all the elders were present.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when he had 
saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the 
Gentiles by his ministry.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And when they heard it, they glorified 
the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews 
there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:<BR>[<B>21</B>] And 
they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the 
Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their 
children, neither to walk after the customs.<BR>[<B>22</B>] What is it 
therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou 
art come.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men 
which have a vow on them;<BR>[<B>24</B>] Them take, and purify thyself with 
them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may 
know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; 
but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they 
observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered 
to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from 
fornication.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying 
himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the 
days of purifcation, until that an offering should be offered for every one of 
them.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which 
were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and 
laid hands on him,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the 
man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this 
place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this 
holy place.<BR>[<B>29</B>] (For they had seen before with him in the city 
Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the 
temple.)<BR>[<B>30</B>] And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: 
and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were 
shut.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the 
chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.<BR>[<B>32</B>] 
Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when 
they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of 
Paul.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and 
commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he 
had done.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And some cried one thing, some another, among the 
multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded 
him to be carried into the castle.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And when he came upon the 
stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the 
people.<BR>[<B>36</B>] For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, 
Away with him.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said 
unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak 
Greek?<BR>[<B>38</B>] Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest 
an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were 
murderers?<BR>[<B>39</B>] But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a 
city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to 
speak unto the people.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And when he had given him licence, Paul 
stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there 
was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.22</H3>[<B>1</B>] Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which 
I make now unto you.<BR>[<B>2</B>] (And when they heard that he spake in the 
Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought 
up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect 
manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this 
day.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and 
delivering into prisons both men and women.<BR>[<B>5</B>] As also the high 
priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I 
received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which 
were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And it came 
to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, 
suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And 
I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me?<BR>[<B>8</B>] And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he 
said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And 
they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not 
the voice of him that spake to me.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And I said, What shall I do, 
Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall 
be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of 
them that were with me, I came into Damascus.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And one Ananias, a 
devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which 
dwelt there,<BR>[<B>13</B>] Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother 
Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know 
his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his 
mouth.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou 
hast seen and heard.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be 
baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the 
Lord.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to 
Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: 
for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And I 
said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that 
believed on thee:<BR>[<B>20</B>] And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was 
shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the 
raiment of them that slew him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he said unto me, Depart: for I 
will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And they gave him 
audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with 
such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should 
live.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and 
threw dust into the air,<BR>[<B>24</B>] The chief captain commanded him to be 
brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that 
he might know wherefore they cried so against him.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And as they 
bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful 
for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?<BR>[<B>26</B>] When 
the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed 
what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Then the chief captain 
came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.<BR>[<B>28</B>] 
And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And 
Paul said, But I was free born.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then straightway they departed 
from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, 
after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.<BR>[<B>30</B>] 
On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was 
accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief 
priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him 
before them.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.23</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men 
and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this 
day.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him 
to smite him on the mouth.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Then said Paul unto him, God shall 
smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and 
commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?<BR>[<B>4</B>] And they that 
stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?<BR>[<B>5</B>] Then said Paul, I 
wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt 
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But when Paul perceived 
that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the 
council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope 
and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when he 
had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: 
and the multitude was divided.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For the Sadducees say that there is 
no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess 
both.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of 
the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but 
if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against 
God.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, 
fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the 
soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him 
into the castle.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the night following the Lord stood by him, 
and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, 
so must thou bear witness also at Rome.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when it was day, 
certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying 
that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves 
under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain 
Paul.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief 
captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire 
something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready 
to kill him.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in 
wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Then 
Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto 
the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.<BR>[<B>18</B>] So he 
took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner 
called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath 
something to say unto thee.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Then the chief captain took him by 
the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou 
hast to tell me?<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee 
that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they 
would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But do not thou 
yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, 
which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink 
till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from 
thee.<BR>[<B>22</B>] So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and 
charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to 
me.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two 
hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and 
spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;<BR>[<B>24</B>] And provide 
them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the 
governor.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And he wrote a letter after this manner:<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth 
greeting.<BR>[<B>27</B>] This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been 
killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood 
that he was a Roman.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And when I would have known the cause 
wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their 
council:<BR>[<B>29</B>] Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their 
law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of 
bonds.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for 
the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also 
to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Then the 
soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to 
Antipatris.<BR>[<B>32</B>] On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, 
and returned to the castle:<BR>[<B>33</B>] Who, when they came to Caesarea, and 
delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before 
him.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what 
province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;<BR>[<B>35</B>] I 
will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him 
to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.24</H3>[<B>1</B>] And after five days Ananias the high priest descended 
with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the 
governor against Paul.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when he was called forth, Tertullus 
began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and 
that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy 
providence,<BR>[<B>3</B>] We accept it always, and in all places, most noble 
Felix, with all thankfulness.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Notwithstanding, that I be not 
further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy 
clemency a few words.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For we have found this man a pestilent 
fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a 
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:<BR>[<B>6</B>] Who also hath gone about 
to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our 
law.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great 
violence took him away out of our hands,<BR>[<B>8</B>] Commanding his accusers 
to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all 
these things, whereof we accuse him.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the Jews also assented, 
saying that these things were so.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Then Paul, after that the 
governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou 
hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully 
answer for myself:<BR>[<B>11</B>] Because that thou mayest understand, that 
there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to 
worship.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they neither found me in the temple disputing with 
any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the 
city:<BR>[<B>13</B>] Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse 
me.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they 
call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are 
written in the law and in the prophets:<BR>[<B>15</B>] And have hope toward God, 
which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the 
dead, both of the just and unjust.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And herein do I exercise 
myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward 
men.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and 
offerings.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in 
the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Who ought to 
have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against 
me.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil 
doing in me, while I stood before the council,<BR>[<B>21</B>] Except it be for 
this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of 
the dead I am called in question by you this day.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And when Felix 
heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, 
and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the 
uttermost of your matter.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he commanded a centurion to keep 
Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his 
acquaintance to minister or come unto him.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And after certain 
days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for 
Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And as he 
reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and 
answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call 
for thee.<BR>[<B>26</B>] He hoped also that money should have been given him of 
Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and 
communed with him.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But after two years Porcius Festus came into 
Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul 
bound.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.25</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now when Festus was come into the province, after 
three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Then the high 
priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought 
him,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to 
Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] But Festus 
answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart 
shortly thither.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Let them therefore, said he, which among you are 
able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in 
him.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he 
went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded 
Paul to be brought.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when he was come, the Jews which came down 
from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against 
Paul, which they could not prove.<BR>[<B>8</B>] While he answered for himself, 
Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against 
Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But Festus, willing to 
do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, 
and there be judged of these things before me?<BR>[<B>10</B>] Then said Paul, I 
stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I 
done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For if I be an 
offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but 
if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me 
unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then Festus, when he had 
conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto 
Caesar shalt thou go.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And after certain days king Agrippa and 
Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when they had 
been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There 
is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:<BR>[<B>15</B>] About whom, when I was 
at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring 
to have judgment against him.<BR>[<B>16</B>] To whom I answered, It is not the 
manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused 
have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself 
concerning the crime laid against him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Therefore, when they were 
come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and 
commanded the man to be brought forth.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Against whom when the 
accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I 
supposed:<BR>[<B>19</B>] But had certain questions against him of their own 
superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be 
alive.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked 
him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these 
matters.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the 
hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to 
Caesar.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man 
myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And on the 
morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered 
into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the 
city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And Festus 
said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, 
about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, 
and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But 
when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself 
hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Of whom 
I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him 
forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after 
examination had, I might have somewhat to write.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For it seemeth 
to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid 
against him.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.26</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to 
speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for 
himself:<BR>[<B>2</B>] I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall 
answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am 
accused of the Jews:<BR>[<B>3</B>] Especially because I know thee to be expert 
in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee 
to hear me patiently.<BR>[<B>4</B>] My manner of life from my youth, which was 
at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the 
Jews;<BR>[<B>5</B>] Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, 
that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a 
Pharisee.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the 
promise made of God unto our fathers:<BR>[<B>7</B>] Unto which promise our 
twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which 
hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Why should it 
be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the 
dead?<BR>[<B>9</B>] I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things 
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Which thing I also did 
in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received 
authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my 
voice against them.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And I punished them oft in every synagogue, 
and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I 
persecuted them even unto strange cities.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Whereupon as I went to 
Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,<BR>[<B>13</B>] At 
midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of 
the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and 
saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for 
thee to kick against the pricks.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And I said, Who art thou, Lord? 
And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But rise, and 
stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make 
thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of 
those things in the which I will appear unto thee;<BR>[<B>17</B>] Delivering 
thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send 
thee,<BR>[<B>18</B>] To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to 
light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness 
of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in 
me.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the 
heavenly vision:<BR>[<B>20</B>] But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at 
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, 
that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for 
repentance.<BR>[<B>21</B>] For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, 
and went about to kill me.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Having therefore obtained help of God, 
I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other 
things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should 
come:<BR>[<B>23</B>] That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first 
that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to 
the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with 
a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee 
mad.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak 
forth the words of truth and soberness.<BR>[<B>26</B>] For the king knoweth of 
these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of 
these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a 
corner.<BR>[<B>27</B>] King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that 
thou believest.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou 
persuadest me to be a Christian.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And Paul said, I would to God, 
that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and 
altogether such as I am, except these bonds.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And when he had thus 
spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with 
them:<BR>[<B>31</B>] And when they were gone aside, they talked between 
themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of 
bonds.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been 
set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.27</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when it was determined that we should sail into 
Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a 
centurion of Augustus' band.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And entering into a ship of 
Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one 
Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And the 
next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave 
him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when we 
had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were 
contrary.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and 
Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And there the 
centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us 
therein.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were 
come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over 
against Salmone;<BR>[<B>8</B>] And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which 
is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the 
fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,<BR>[<B>10</B>] And said unto 
them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not 
only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Nevertheless 
the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those 
things which were spoken by Paul.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And because the haven was not 
commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any 
means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of 
Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And when 
the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, 
loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But not long after 
there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her 
drive.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, 
we had much work to come by the boat:<BR>[<B>17</B>] Which when they had taken 
up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall 
into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And we 
being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the 
ship;<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the third day we cast out with our own hands the 
tackling of the ship.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And when neither sun nor stars in many days 
appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was 
then taken away.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in 
the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not 
have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any 
man's life among you, but of the ship.<BR>[<B>23</B>] For there stood by me this 
night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,<BR>[<B>24</B>] Saying, 
Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee 
all them that sail with thee.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: 
for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But when the 
fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about 
midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;<BR>[<B>28</B>] 
And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little 
further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then 
fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the 
stern, and wished for the day.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And as the shipmen were about to 
flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour 
as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,<BR>[<B>31</B>] Paul 
said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye 
cannot be saved.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, 
and let her fall off.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And while the day was coming on, Paul 
besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye 
have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.<BR>[<B>34</B>] 
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there 
shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And when he 
had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: 
and when he had broken it, he began to eat.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Then were they all of 
good cheer, and they also took some meat.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And we were in all in 
the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And when they 
had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the 
sea.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they 
discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it 
were possible, to thrust in the ship.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And when they had taken up 
the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder 
bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward 
shore.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the 
ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the 
hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And the 
soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, 
and escape.<BR>[<B>43</B>] But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them 
from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast 
themselves first into the sea, and get to land:<BR>[<B>44</B>] And the rest, 
some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, 
that they escaped all safe to land.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Acts.28</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when they were escaped, then they knew that the 
island was called Melita.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the barbarous people shewed us no 
little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of 
the present rain, and because of the cold.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And when Paul had 
gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out 
of the heat, and fastened on his hand.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when the barbarians saw 
the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this 
man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth 
not to live.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no 
harm.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen 
down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm 
come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.<BR>[<B>7</B>] 
In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name 
was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days 
courteously.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay 
sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and 
laid his hands on him, and healed him.<BR>[<B>9</B>] So when this was done, 
others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were 
healed:<BR>[<B>10</B>] Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we 
departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And 
after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in 
the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And landing at 
Syracuse, we tarried there three days.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And from thence we fetched 
a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we 
came the next day to Puteoli:<BR>[<B>14</B>] Where we found brethren, and were 
desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward 
Rome.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came 
to meet us as far as Appiiforum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he 
thanked God, and took courage.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And when we came to Rome, the 
centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was 
suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And it 
came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: 
and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I 
have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I 
delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause 
of death in me.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But when the Jews spake against it, I was 
constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation 
of.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, 
and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this 
chain.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of 
Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake 
any harm of thee.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But we desire to hear of thee what thou 
thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken 
against.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when they had appointed him a day, there came many 
to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, 
persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the 
prophets, from morning till evening.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And some believed the things 
which were spoken, and some believed not.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And when they agreed 
not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well 
spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not 
understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:<BR>[<B>27</B>] For the 
heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and 
their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with 
their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I 
should heal them.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Be it known therefore unto you, that the 
salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear 
it.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had 
great reasoning among themselves.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Paul dwelt two whole years 
in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,<BR>[<B>31</B>] 
Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord 
Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.<BR>
