<P>Having been informed of your godly
love, so well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in 
the faith of Jesus Christ. For as one who has been thought worthy of the most 
honourable of all names,
in those bonds which I bear about, I commend the Churches, in which I pray for a 
union both of the flesh and spirit of Jesus Christ, the constant source of our 
life, and of faith and love, to which nothing is to be preferred, but especially 
of Jesus and the Father, in whom, if we endure all the assaults of the prince of 
this world, and escape them, we shall enjoy God.</P>

<P>Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most 
worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and 
through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose friendship may I ever enjoy, 
inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of God, and to the 
presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ, [I now write
to you].</P>

bishop, and through your worthy
presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon

<UL>
  <P><A name=P1427_252408></A><FONT size=3>Chapter III.-Honour Your Youthful 
  Bishop.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of 
his youth,
but to yield him all reverence, having respect to
the power of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do, not 
judging rashly, from the manifest youthful appearance
[of their bishop], but as being themselves prudent in God, submitting to him, or 
rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It 
is therefore fitting that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey [your 
bishop], in honour of Him who has wired us [so to do], since he that does not so 
deceives not [by such conduct] the bishop that is visible, but seeks to mock Him 
that is invisible. And all such conduct has reference not to man,
but to God, who knows all secrets.</P>
<P>Now it becomes you also not to despise the age of your bishop, but to yield 
him all reverence, according to the will of God the Father, as I have known even 
holy presbyters do, not having regard to the manifest youth [of their bishop], 
but to his knowledge in God; inasmuch as "not the ancient are [necessarily] 
wise, nor do the aged understand prudence; but there is a spirit in men."
For Daniel the wise, at twelve years of age, became possessed of the divine 
Spirit, and convicted the elders, who in vain carried their grey hairs, of being 
false accusers, and of lusting after the beauty of another man's wife.
Samuel also, when he was but a little child, reproved Eli, who was ninety years 
old, for giving honour to his sons rather than to God. 
In like manner, Jeremiah also received this message from God, "Say not, I am a 
child."
Solomon too, and Josiah, [exemplified the same thing.] The former, being made 
king at twelve years of age, gave that terrible and difficult judgment in the 
case of the two women concerning their children.
The latter, coming to the throne when eight years old
cast down the altars and temples [of the idols], and burned down the groves, for 
they were dedicated to demons, and not to God. And he slew the false priests, as 
the corrupters and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity. 
Wherefore youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he is to be 
despised who is of a wicked mind, although he be old, and full of wicked 
days. 
Timothy the Christ-bearer was young, but hear what his teacher writes to him: 
"Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the believers in word 
and in conduct."
It is becoming, therefore, that ye also should be obedient to your bishop, and 
contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful thing to contradict any such 
person. For no one does [by such conduct] deceive him that is visible, but does 
[in reality] seek to mock Him that is invisible, who, however, cannot be mocked 
by any one. And every such act has respect not to man, but to God. For God says 
to Samuel, "They have not mocked thee, but Me."
And Moses declares, "For their murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord 
God."
No one of those has, [in fact, ] remained unpunished, who rose up against their 
superiors. For Dathan and Abiram did not speak against the law, but against 
Moses, 
and were cast down alive into Hades. Korah also,
and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were 
destroyed by fire. Absalom, again,
who had slain his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had his 
evil-designing heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was 
Abeddadan
beheaded for the same reason. Uzziah, 
when he presumed to oppose the priests and the priesthood, was smitten with 
leprosy. Saul also was dishonoured,
because he did not wait for Samuel the high priest. It behoves you, therefore, 
also to reverence your superiors.</P>

  Independently of the Bishop.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in 
reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop, but do all things without 
him. Now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good conscience, 
seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according to the 
commandment.</P>
<P>It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in 
reality. For it is not the being called so, but the being really so, that 
renders a man blessed. To those who indeed talk of the bishop, but do all things 
without him, will He who is the true and first Bishop, and the only High Priest 
by nature, declare, "Why call ye Me Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
For such persons seem to me not possessed of a good conscience, but to be simply 
dissemblers and hypocrites.</P>

  <P><A name=P1462_257545></A><FONT size=3>Chapter V.-Death is the Fate of All 
  Such.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are simultaneously set 
before us-death and life; and every one shall go unto his own place. For as 
there are two kinds of coins, the one of God, the other of the world, and each 
of these has its special character stamped upon it, [so is it also here.]
The unbelieving are of this world; but the believing have, in love, the 
character of God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in readiness 
to die into His passion,
His life is not in us.</P>
<P>Seeing, then, all things have an end, and there is set before us life upon 
our observance [of God's precepts], but death as the result of disobedience, and 
every one, according to the choice he makes, shall go to his own place, let us 
flee from death, and make choice of life. For I remark, that two different 
characters are found among men-the one true coin, the other spurious. The truly 
devout man is the right kind of coin, stamped by God Himself. The ungodly man, 
again, is false coin, unlawful, spurious, counterfeit, wrought not by God, but 
by the devil. I do not mean to say that there are two different human natures, 
but that there is one humanity, sometimes belonging to God, and sometimes to the 
devil. If any one is truly religious, he is a man of God; but if he is 
irreligious, he is a man of the devil, made such, not by nature, but by his own 
choice. The unbelieving bear the image of the prince of wickedness. The 
believing possess the image of their Prince, God the Father, and Jesus Christ, 
through whom, if we are not in readiness to die for the truth into His 
passion, His life is not in us.</P>

  Harmony.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole 
multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all things with 
a divine harmony,
while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place 
of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to 
me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father 
before the beginning of time,
and in the end was revealed. Do ye all then, imitating the same divine 
conduct,
pay respect to one another, and let no one look upon his neighbour after the 
flesh, but do ye continually love each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist 
among you that may divide you ; but be ye united with your bishop, and those 
that preside over you, as a type and evidence of your immortality.

while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place

me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ. He, being begotten by 
the Father before the beginning of time,
was God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and remains the same for ever; for "of 
His kingdom there shall be no end," 
says Daniel the prophet. Let us all therefore love one another in harmony, and 
let no one look upon his neighbour according to the flesh, but in Christ Jesus. 
Let nothing exist among you which may divide you; but be ye united with your 
bishop, being through him subject to God in Christ.</P>

  <P><A name=P1486_261369></A><FONT size=3>Chapter VII.-Do Nothing Without the 
  Bishop and Presbyters.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to Him, 
neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do ye anything without the 
bishop and presbyters. Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and 
proper to yourselves apart; but being come together into the same place, let 
there be one prayer, one supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy 
undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more excellent. Do ye 
therefore all run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar, as to one 
Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to 
one.</P>
<P>As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, "I can of 
mine own self do nothing,"
so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without the 
bishop. Nor let anything appear commendable to you which is destitute of his 
approval.
For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to the will of] God. Do ye all come 
together into the same place for prayer. Let there be one common supplication, 
one mind, one hope, with faith unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing 
is more excellent. Do ye all, as one man, run together into the temple of God, 
as unto one altar, to one Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the unbegotten 
God.</P>

  <P><A name=P1494_262771></A><FONT size=3>Chapter VIII.-Caution Against False 
  Doctrines.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are 
unprofitable. For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge 
that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to 
Christ Jesus. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His 
grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has 
manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not 
proceeding forth from silence,
and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.</P>
<P>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, "nor give heed to fables and endless 
genealogies,"
and things in which the Jews make their boast. "Old things are passed away: 
behold, all things have become new."
For if we still live according to the Jewish law, and the circumcision of the 
flesh, we deny that we have received grace. For the divinest prophets lived 
according to Jesus Christ. On this account also they were persecuted, being 
inspired by grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, the 
Almighty, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, 
not spoken, but essential. For He is not the voice of an articulate utterance, 
but a substance begotten by divine power, who has in all things pleased Him that 
sent Him.

  <P><A name=P1504_264385></A><FONT size=3>Chapter IX.-Let Us Live with 
  Christ.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of 
things 
have come to the possession of a new
hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance 
of the Lord's Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His 
death-whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained faith,
and therefore endure, that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our 
only Master-how shall we be able to live apart from Him, whose disciples the 
prophets themselves in the Spirit did wait for Him as their Teacher? And 
therefore He whom they rightly waited for, being come, raised them from the 
dead.
</P>
<P>If, then, those who were conversant with the ancient Scriptures came to 
newness of hope, expecting the coming of Christ, as the Lord teaches us when He 
says, "If ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me;" 
and again, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was 
glad; for before Abraham was, I am; "
how shall we be able to live without Him? The prophets were His servants, and 
foresaw Him by the Spirit, and waited for Him as their Teacher, and expected Him 
as their Lord and Saviour, saying, "He will come and save us."
Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice 
in days of idleness; for "he that does not work, let him not eat."
For say the [holy] oracles, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy 
bread." 
But let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in 
meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship 
of God, and not eating things prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm 
drinks, and walking within a prescribed space, nor finding delight in dancing 
and plaudits which have no sense in them.
And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the 
Lord's Day as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the 
days [of the week]. Looking forward to this, the prophet declared, "To the end, 
for the eighth day,"
on which our life both sprang up again, and the victory over death was obtained 
in Christ, whom the children of perdition, the enemies of the Saviour, deny, 
"whose god is their belly, who mind earthly things,"
who are "lovers of pleasure, and not lovers of God, having a form of godliness, 
but denying the power thereof."
These make merchandise of Christ, corrupting His word, and giving up Jesus to 
sale: they are corrupters of women, and covetous of other men's possessions, 
swallowing up wealth
insatiably; from whom may ye be delivered by the mercy of God through our Lord 
Jesus Christ!</P>

  <P><A name=P1527_267641></A><FONT size=3>Chapter X.-Beware of 
  Judaizing.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward 
us according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His 
disciples, let us learn to live according to the principles of 
Christianity.
For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, is not of God. Lay 
aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed into the 
new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among you 
should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to 
profess
Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace
Judaism, but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believeth might be 
gathered together to God.</P>
<P>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward 
us according to our works, we should cease to be. For "if Thou, Lord, shalt mark 
iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? "
Let us therefore prove ourselves worthy of that name which we have received. For 
whosoever is called by any other name besides this, he is not of God; for he has 
not received the prophecy which speaks thus concerning us: "The people shall be 
called by a new name, which the Lord shall name them, and shall be a holy 
people." 
This was first fulfilled in Syria; for "the disciples were called Christians at 
Antioch,"
when Paul and Peter were laying the foundations of the Church. Lay aside, 
therefore, the evil, the old, the corrupt leaven, 
and be ye changed into the new leaven of grace. Abide in Christ, that the 
stranger
may not have dominion over you. It is absurd to speak of Jesus Christ with the 
tongue, and to cherish in the mind a Judaism which has now come to an end. For 
where there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism. For Christ is one, in whom 
every nation that believes, and every tongue that confesses, is gathered unto 
God. And those that were of a stony heart have become the children of Abraham, 
the friend of God;
and in his seed all those have been blessed
who were ordained to eternal life
in Christ.</P>

  Warn You.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you to be 
in such a state;
but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not 
upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that ye attain to full assurance in regard 
to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the 
government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by Jesus 
Christ, who is our hope,
from which may no one of you ever be turned aside.</P>
<P>These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you to be 
in such a state;
but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not 
upon the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you may rather attain to a full 
assurance in Christ, who was begotten by the Father before all ages, but was 
afterwards born of the Virgin Mary without any intercourse with man. He also 
lived a holy life, and healed every kind of sickness and disease among the 
people, and wrought signs and wonders for the benefit of men; and to those who 
had fallen into the error of polytheism He made known the one and only true God, 
His Father, and underwent the passion, and endured the cross at the hands of the 
Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the governor and Herod the king. He 
also died, and rose again, and ascended into the heavens to Him that sent Him, 
and is sat down at His right hand, and shall come at the end of the world, with 
His Father's glory, to judge the living and the dead, and to render to every one 
according to his works.
He who knows these things with a full assurance, and believes them, is happy; 
even as ye are now the lovers of God and of Christ, in the full assurance of our 
hope, from which may no one of us
ever be turned aside!</P>

  Me.</FONT></P></UL>
<P>May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For though I am 
bound, I am not worthy to be compared to any of you that are at liberty. I know 
that ye are not puffed up, for ye have Jesus Christ in yourselves. And all the 
more when I commend you, I know that ye cherish modesty
of spirit; as it is written, "The righteous man is his own accuser."

that ye are not puffed up, for ye have Jesus in yourselves. And all the more 
when I commend you, I know that ye cherish modesty 
of spirit; as it is written, "The righteous man is his own accuser; " 
and again, "Declare thou first thine iniquities, that thou mayest be justified;"
and again, "When ye shall have done all things that are commanded you," say, "We 
are unprofitable servants; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of 
God."
For says [the Scripture], "God be merciful to me a sinner." 
Therefore those great ones, Abraham and Job, 
styled themselves "dust and ashes 
before God. And David says, "Who am I before Thee, 0 Lord, that Thou hast 
glorified me hitherto? "
And Moses, who was "the meekest of all men," 
saith to God, "I am of a feeble voice, and of a slow tongue." 
Be ye therefore also of a humble spirit, that ye may be exalted; for "he that 
abaseth himself shall be exalted, and he that exalteth himself shall be 
abased."

<P>Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the
