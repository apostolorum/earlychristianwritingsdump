<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Luke</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in 
order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among 
us,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning 
were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;<BR>[<B>3</B>] It seemed good to me 
also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to 
write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,<BR>[<B>4</B>] That thou 
mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been 
instructed.<BR>[<B>5</B>] There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a 
certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the 
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And they were both 
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord 
blameless.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was 
barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And it came 
to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of 
his course,<BR>[<B>9</B>] According to the custom of the priest's office, his 
lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of 
incense.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord 
standing on the right side of the altar of incense.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when 
Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But 
the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy 
wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name 
John.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall 
rejoice at his birth.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For he shall be great in the sight of the 
Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with 
the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And many of the 
children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he 
shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the 
fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make 
ready a people prepared for the Lord.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Zacharias said unto the 
angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken 
in years.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, 
that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew 
thee these glad tidings.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not 
able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou 
believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in 
the temple.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: 
and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto 
them, and remained speechless.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And it came to pass, that, as soon 
as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own 
house.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid 
herself five months, saying,<BR>[<B>25</B>] Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in 
the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among 
men.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God 
unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<BR>[<B>27</B>] To a virgin espoused to a 
man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was 
Mary.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that 
art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among 
women.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and 
cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And 
the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with 
God.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring 
forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<BR>[<B>32</B>] He shall be great, 
and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him 
the throne of his father David:<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he shall reign over the house 
of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Then 
said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a 
man?<BR>[<B>35</B>] And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost 
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: 
therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the 
Son of God.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also 
conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was 
called barren.<BR>[<B>37</B>] For with God nothing shall be 
impossible.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it 
unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.<BR>[<B>39</B>] 
And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a 
city of Juda;<BR>[<B>40</B>] And entered into the house of Zacharias, and 
saluted Elisabeth.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth 
heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was 
filled with the Holy Ghost:<BR>[<B>42</B>] And she spake out with a loud voice, 
and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy 
womb.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should 
come to me?<BR>[<B>44</B>] For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation 
sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And 
blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things 
which were told her from the Lord.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And Mary said, My soul doth 
magnify the Lord,<BR>[<B>47</B>] And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my 
Saviour.<BR>[<B>48</B>] For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: 
for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me 
blessed.<BR>[<B>49</B>] For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and 
holy is his name.<BR>[<B>50</B>] And his mercy is on them that fear him from 
generation to generation.<BR>[<B>51</B>] He hath shewed strength with his arm; 
he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<BR>[<B>52</B>] 
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low 
degree.<BR>[<B>53</B>] He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich 
he hath sent empty away.<BR>[<B>54</B>] He hath holpen his servant Israel, in 
remembrance of his mercy;<BR>[<B>55</B>] As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, 
and to his seed for ever.<BR>[<B>56</B>] And Mary abode with her about three 
months, and returned to her own house.<BR>[<B>57</B>] Now Elisabeth's full time 
came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.<BR>[<B>58</B>] 
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy 
upon her; and they rejoiced with her.<BR>[<B>59</B>] And it came to pass, that 
on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him 
Zacharias, after the name of his father.<BR>[<B>60</B>] And his mother answered 
and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.<BR>[<B>61</B>] And they said unto 
her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.<BR>[<B>62</B>] 
And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.<BR>[<B>63</B>] 
And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they 
marvelled all.<BR>[<B>64</B>] And his mouth was opened immediately, and his 
tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.<BR>[<B>65</B>] And fear came on 
all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad 
throughout all the hill country of Judaea.<BR>[<B>66</B>] And all they that 
heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this 
be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.<BR>[<B>67</B>] And his father 
Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,<BR>[<B>68</B>] 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his 
people,<BR>[<B>69</B>] And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the 
house of his servant David;<BR>[<B>70</B>] As he spake by the mouth of his holy 
prophets, which have been since the world began:<BR>[<B>71</B>] That we should 
be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;<BR>[<B>72</B>] 
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy 
covenant;<BR>[<B>73</B>] The oath which he sware to our father 
Abraham,<BR>[<B>74</B>] That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out 
of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,<BR>[<B>75</B>] In 
holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.<BR>[<B>76</B>] 
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go 
before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;<BR>[<B>77</B>] To give 
knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their 
sins,<BR>[<B>78</B>] Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring 
from on high hath visited us,<BR>[<B>79</B>] To give light to them that sit in 
darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of 
peace.<BR>[<B>80</B>] And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in 
the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass in those days, that there went out 
a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of 
Syria.)<BR>[<B>3</B>] And all went to be taxed, every one into his own 
city.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of 
Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; 
(because he was of the house and lineage of David:)<BR>[<B>5</B>] To be taxed 
with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And so it 
was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be 
delivered.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped 
him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room 
for them in the inn.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And there were in the same country shepherds 
abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone 
round about them: and they were sore afraid.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the angel said 
unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which 
shall be to all people.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For unto you is born this day in the city 
of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And this shall be a 
sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a 
manger.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the 
heavenly host praising God, and saying,<BR>[<B>14</B>] Glory to God in the 
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And it came to 
pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one 
to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come 
to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And they came 
with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a 
manger.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the 
saying which was told them concerning this child.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And all they 
that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the 
shepherds.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in 
her heart.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising 
God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto 
them.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising 
of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before 
he was conceived in the womb.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And when the days of her 
purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him 
to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;<BR>[<B>23</B>] (As it is written in 
the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to 
the Lord;)<BR>[<B>24</B>] And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is 
said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young 
pigeons.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name 
was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of 
Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And it was revealed unto 
him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the 
Lord's Christ.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and 
when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of 
the law,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and 
said,<BR>[<B>29</B>] Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, 
according to thy word:<BR>[<B>30</B>] For mine eyes have seen thy 
salvation,<BR>[<B>31</B>] Which thou hast prepared before the face of all 
people;<BR>[<B>32</B>] A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy 
people Israel.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those 
things which were spoken of him.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And Simeon blessed them, and 
said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising 
again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken 
against;<BR>[<B>35</B>] (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) 
that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And there was 
one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was 
of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her 
virginity;<BR>[<B>37</B>] And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, 
which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers 
night and day.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And she coming in that instant gave thanks 
likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption 
in Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And when they had performed all things according to 
the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city 
Nazareth.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled 
with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.<BR>[<B>41</B>] Now his parents 
went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And 
when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the 
feast.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, 
the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not 
of it.<BR>[<B>44</B>] But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went 
a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and 
acquaintance.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And when they found him not, they turned back again 
to Jerusalem, seeking him.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And it came to pass, that after three 
days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both 
hearing them, and asking them questions.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And all that heard him 
were astonished at his understanding and answers.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And when they 
saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus 
dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee 
sorrowing.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? 
wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<BR>[<B>50</B>] And they 
understood not the saying which he spake unto them.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And he went 
down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother 
kept all these sayings in her heart.<BR>[<B>52</B>] And Jesus increased in 
wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius 
Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of 
Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of 
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Annas and 
Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of 
Zacharias in the wilderness.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he came into all the country 
about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of 
sins;<BR>[<B>4</B>] As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the 
prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way 
of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Every valley shall be 
filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall 
be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;<BR>[<B>6</B>] And all 
flesh shall see the salvation of God.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Then said he to the 
multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who 
hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<BR>[<B>8</B>] Bring forth 
therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, 
We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these 
stones to raise up children unto Abraham.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And now also the axe is 
laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth 
good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the people 
asked him, saying, What shall we do then?<BR>[<B>11</B>] He answereth and saith 
unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he 
that hath meat, let him do likewise.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then came also publicans to 
be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he 
said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he 
said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be 
content with your wages.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And as the people were in expectation, 
and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or 
not;<BR>[<B>16</B>] John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you 
with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not 
worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with 
fire:<BR>[<B>17</B>] Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his 
floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn 
with fire unquenchable.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And many other things in his exhortation 
preached he unto the people.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But Herod the tetrarch, being 
reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils 
which Herod had done,<BR>[<B>20</B>] Added yet this above all, that he shut up 
John in prison.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Now when all the people were baptized, it came to 
pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was 
opened,<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a 
dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved 
Son; in thee I am well pleased.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And Jesus himself began to be 
about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was 
the son of Heli,<BR>[<B>24</B>] Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son 
of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the 
son of Joseph,<BR>[<B>25</B>] Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son

the son of Juda,<BR>[<B>27</B>] Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son 
of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which 
was the son of Neri,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Which was the son of Melchi, which was the 
son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was 
the son of Er,<BR>[<B>29</B>] Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of 
Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the 
son of Levi,<BR>[<B>30</B>] Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of 
Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son 
of Eliakim,<BR>[<B>31</B>] Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of 
Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the 
son of David,<BR>[<B>32</B>] Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of 
Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son 
of Naasson,<BR>[<B>33</B>] Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of 
Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son 
of Juda,<BR>[<B>34</B>] Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, 
which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of 
Nachor,<BR>[<B>35</B>] Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, 
which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of 
Sala,<BR>[<B>36</B>] Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, 
which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of 
Lamech,<BR>[<B>37</B>] Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of 
Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the 
son of Cainan,<BR>[<B>38</B>] Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of 
Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from 
Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Being forty 
days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they 
were ended, he afterward hungered.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And the devil said unto him, If 
thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread 
alone, but by every word of God.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And the devil, taking him up into 
an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of 
time.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give 
thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I 
will I give it.<BR>[<B>7</B>] If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be 
thine.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, 
Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only 
shalt thou serve.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on 
a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast 
thyself down from hence:<BR>[<B>10</B>] For it is written, He shall give his 
angels charge over thee, to keep thee:<BR>[<B>11</B>] And in their hands they 
shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a 
stone.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt 
not tempt the Lord thy God.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And when the devil had ended all the 
temptation, he departed from him for a season.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And Jesus returned 
in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him 
through all the region round about.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he taught in their 
synagogues, being glorified of all.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he came to Nazareth, 
where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue 
on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And there was 
delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the 
book, he found the place where it was written,<BR>[<B>18</B>] The Spirit of the 
Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; 
he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the 
captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are 
bruised,<BR>[<B>19</B>] To preach the acceptable year of the 
Lord.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the 
minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were 
fastened on him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he began to say unto them, This day is this 
scripture fulfilled in your ears.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And all bare him witness, and 
wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, 
Is not this Joseph's son?<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he said unto them, Ye will surely 
say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done 
in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And he said, Verily I 
say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But I 
tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the 
heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout 
all the land;<BR>[<B>26</B>] But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto 
Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And many 
lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was 
cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And all they in the 
synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,<BR>[<B>29</B>] 
And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the 
hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down 
headlong.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But he passing through the midst of them went his 
way,<BR>[<B>31</B>] And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught 
them on the sabbath days.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they were astonished at his 
doctrine: for his word was with power.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And in the synagogue there 
was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud 
voice,<BR>[<B>34</B>] Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou 
Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the 
Holy One of God.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, 
and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out 
of him, and hurt him not.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And they were all amazed, and spake 
among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he 
commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And the fame 
of him went out into every place of the country round about.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And 
he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's 
wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for 
her.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left 
her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.<BR>[<B>40</B>] Now when 
the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought 
them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed 
them.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, 
Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: 
for they knew that he was Christ.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And when it was day, he 
departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto 
him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And he 
said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for 
therefore am I sent.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And he preached in the synagogues of 
Galilee.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon 
him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, 
and were washing their nets.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he entered into one of the ships, 
which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the 
land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Now 
when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let 
down your nets for a draught.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And Simon answering said unto him, 
Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at 
thy word I will let down the net.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when they had this done, 
they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.<BR>[<B>7</B>] 
And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they 
should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that 
they began to sink.<BR>[<B>8</B>] When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at 
Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O 
Lord.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the 
draught of the fishes which they had taken:<BR>[<B>10</B>] And so was also 
James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus 
said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed 
him.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a 
man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, 
saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he put 
forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately 
the leprosy departed from him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And he charged him to tell no man: 
but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according 
as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But so much the 
more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to 
hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he 
withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And it came to 
pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors 
of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, 
and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal 
them.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken 
with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before 
him.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when they could not find by what way they might bring 
him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down 
through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven 
thee.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, 
Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God 
alone?<BR>[<B>22</B>] But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said 
unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?<BR>[<B>23</B>] Whether is easier, to 
say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?<BR>[<B>24</B>] But 
that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he 
said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, 
and go into thine house.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And immediately he rose up before them, 
and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying 
God.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were 
filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And 
after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the 
receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And he left 
all, rose up, and followed him.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And Levi made him a great feast 
in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that 
sat down with them.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But their scribes and Pharisees murmured 
against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and 
sinners?<BR>[<B>31</B>] And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole 
need not a physician; but they that are sick.<BR>[<B>32</B>] I came not to call 
the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And they said unto him, 
Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the 
disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?<BR>[<B>34</B>] And he said 
unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the 
bridegroom is with them?<BR>[<B>35</B>] But the days will come, when the 
bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those 
days.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a 
piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a 
rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the 
old.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new 
wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall 
perish.<BR>[<B>38</B>] But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are 
preserved.<BR>[<B>39</B>] No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth 
new: for he saith, The old is better.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the 
first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears 
of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And certain of 
the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the 
sabbath days?<BR>[<B>3</B>] And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so 
much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were 
with him;<BR>[<B>4</B>] How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat 
the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful 
to eat but for the priests alone?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he said unto them, That the 
Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And it came to pass also 
on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was 
a man whose right hand was withered.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And the scribes and Pharisees 
watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an 
accusation against him.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But he knew their thoughts, and said to 
the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And 
he arose and stood forth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask 
you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to 
save life, or to destroy it?<BR>[<B>10</B>] And looking round about upon them 
all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand 
was restored whole as the other.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And they were filled with 
madness; and communed one with another what they might do to 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a 
mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, 
whom also he named apostles;<BR>[<B>14</B>] Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) 
and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called 
Zelotes,<BR>[<B>16</B>] And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, 
which also was the traitor.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he came down with them, and stood 
in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people 
out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which 
came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;<BR>[<B>18</B>] And they 
that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And 
the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and 
healed them all.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and 
said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep 
now: for ye shall laugh.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, 
and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and 
cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Rejoice ye 
in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for 
in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But woe 
unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! 
for ye shall mourn and weep.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Woe unto you, when all men shall 
speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false 
prophets.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do 
good to them which hate you,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Bless them that curse you, and pray 
for them which despitefully use you.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And unto him that smiteth 
thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke 
forbid not to take thy coat also.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Give to every man that asketh 
of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not 
again.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to 
them likewise.<BR>[<B>32</B>] For if ye love them which love you, what thank 
have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And if ye do 
good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even 
the same.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what 
thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much 
again.<BR>[<B>35</B>] But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping 
for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children 
of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the 
evil.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is 
merciful.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and 
ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<BR>[<B>38</B>] 
Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken 
together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same 
measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.<BR>[<B>39</B>] 
And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not 
both fall into the ditch?<BR>[<B>40</B>] The disciple is not above his master: 
but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And why 
beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the 
beam that is in thine own eye?<BR>[<B>42</B>] Either how canst thou say to thy 
brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou 
thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast 
out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull 
out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.<BR>[<B>43</B>] For a good tree 
bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good 
fruit.<BR>[<B>44</B>] For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns 
men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.<BR>[<B>45</B>] 
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is 
good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that 
which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth 
speaketh.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things 
which I say?<BR>[<B>47</B>] Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and 
doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:<BR>[<B>48</B>] He is like a man 
which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and 
when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not 
shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.<BR>[<B>49</B>] But he that heareth, 
and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the 
earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; 
and the ruin of that house was great.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience 
of the people, he entered into Capernaum.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And a certain 
centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to 
die.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of 
the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was 
worthy for whom he should do this:<BR>[<B>5</B>] For he loveth our nation, and 
he hath built us a synagogue.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Then Jesus went with them. And when 
he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying 
unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest 
enter under my roof:<BR>[<B>7</B>] Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to 
come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.<BR>[<B>8</B>] 
For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say 
unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my 
servant, Do this, and he doeth it.<BR>[<B>9</B>] When Jesus heard these things, 
he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that 
followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in 
Israel.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they that were sent, returning to the house, found 
the servant whole that had been sick.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And it came to pass the day 
after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with 
him, and much people.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now when he came nigh to the gate of the 
city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and 
she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep 
not.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him 
stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his 
mother.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, 
saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited 
his people.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And this rumour of him went forth throughout all 
Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the 
disciples of John shewed him of all these things.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And John 
calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he 
that should come? or look we for another?<BR>[<B>20</B>] When the men were come 
unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he 
that should come? or look we for another?<BR>[<B>21</B>] And in that same hour 
he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto 
many that were blind he gave sight.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then Jesus answering said 
unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how 
that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the 
dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And blessed 
is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when the 
messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning 
John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the 
wind?<BR>[<B>25</B>] But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft 
raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are 
in kings' courts.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? 
Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.<BR>[<B>27</B>] This is he, of 
whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall 
prepare thy way before thee.<BR>[<B>28</B>] For I say unto you, Among those that 
are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he 
that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And all 
the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with 
the baptism of John.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the 
counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And 
the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to 
what are they like?<BR>[<B>32</B>] They are like unto children sitting in the 
marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and 
ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.<BR>[<B>33</B>] 
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He 
hath a devil.<BR>[<B>34</B>] The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye 
say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and 
sinners!<BR>[<B>35</B>] But wisdom is justified of all her 
children.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat 
with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to 
meat.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when 
she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster 
box of ointment,<BR>[<B>38</B>] And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and 
began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, 
and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.<BR>[<B>39</B>] Now 
when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, 
This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman 
this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And Jesus 
answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, 
Master, say on.<BR>[<B>41</B>] There was a certain creditor which had two 
debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<BR>[<B>42</B>] 
And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me 
therefore, which of them will love him most?<BR>[<B>43</B>] Simon answered and 
said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou 
hast rightly judged.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And he turned to the woman, and said unto 
Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no 
water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with 
the hairs of her head.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman 
since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<BR>[<B>46</B>] My head 
with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with 
ointment.<BR>[<B>47</B>] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, 
are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same 
loveth little.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And he said unto her, Thy sins are 
forgiven.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And they that sat at meat with him began to say within 
themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<BR>[<B>50</B>] And he said to 
the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout 
every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of 
God: and the twelve were with him,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And certain women, which had 
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom 
went seven devils,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, 
and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their 
substance.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when much people were gathered together, and were 
come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:<BR>[<B>5</B>] A sower went 
out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was 
trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And some fell 
upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it 
lacked moisture.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang 
up with it, and choked it.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And other fell on good ground, and 
sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he 
cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And his disciples 
asked him, saying, What might this parable be?<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he said, Unto 
you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in 
parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not 
understand.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of 
God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the 
devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe 
and be saved.<BR>[<B>13</B>] They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, 
receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, 
and in time of temptation fall away.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And that which fell among 
thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with 
cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to 
perfection.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But that on the good ground are they, which in an 
honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit 
with patience.<BR>[<B>16</B>] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it 
with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that 
they which enter in may see the light.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For nothing is secret, 
that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known 
and come abroad.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever 
hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken 
even that which he seemeth to have.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Then came to him his mother 
and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And it 
was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, 
desiring to see thee.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he answered and said unto them, My 
mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do 
it.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a 
ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other 
side of the lake. And they launched forth.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But as they sailed he 
fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were 
filled with water, and were in jeopardy.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And they came to him, 
and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the 
wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a 
calm.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being 
afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he 
commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they 
arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against 
Galilee.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the 
city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither 
abode in any house, but in the tombs.<BR>[<B>28</B>] When he saw Jesus, he cried 
out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do 
with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me 
not.<BR>[<B>29</B>] (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the 
man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in 
fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the 
wilderness.)<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And 
he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And 
they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the 
deep.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the 
mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. 
And he suffered them.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Then went the devils out of the man, and 
entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the 
lake, and were choked.<BR>[<B>34</B>] When they that fed them saw what was done, 
they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, 
out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and 
in his right mind: and they were afraid.<BR>[<B>36</B>] They also which saw it 
told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was 
healed.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes 
round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great 
fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Now 
the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with 
him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,<BR>[<B>39</B>] Return to thine own house, 
and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and 
published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto 
him.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the 
people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.<BR>[<B>41</B>] 
And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: 
and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his 
house:<BR>[<B>42</B>] For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, 
and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And 
a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living 
upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,<BR>[<B>44</B>] Came behind him, 
and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood 
stanched.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter 
and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press 
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?<BR>[<B>46</B>] And Jesus said, Somebody 
hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.<BR>[<B>47</B>] 
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling 
down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she 
had touched him and how she was healed immediately.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And he said 
unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in 
peace.<BR>[<B>49</B>] While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the 
synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the 
Master.<BR>[<B>50</B>] But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear 
not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And when he came 
into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, 
and the father and the mother of the maiden.<BR>[<B>52</B>] And all wept, and 
bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but 
sleepeth.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was 
dead.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and 
called, saying, Maid, arise.<BR>[<B>55</B>] And her spirit came again, and she 
arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.<BR>[<B>56</B>] And her 
parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what 
was done.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave 
them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the 
sick.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, 
neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats 
apiece.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and 
thence depart.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out 
of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against 
them.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the 
gospel, and healing every where.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Now Herod the tetrarch heard of 
all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of 
some, that John was risen from the dead;<BR>[<B>8</B>] And of some, that Elias 
had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen 
again.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of 
whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the 
apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took 
them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called 
Bethsaida.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and 
he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them 
that had need of healing.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when the day began to wear away, 
then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may 
go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we 
are here in a desert place.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But he said unto them, Give ye them 
to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we 
should go and buy meat for all this people.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For they were about 
five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties 
in a company.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And they did so, and made them all sit 
down.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and 
looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to 
set before the multitude.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And they did eat, and were all filled: 
and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve 
baskets.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his 
disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I 
am?<BR>[<B>19</B>] They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; 
and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.<BR>[<B>20</B>] He 
said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of 
God.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no 
man that thing;<BR>[<B>22</B>] Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, 
and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and 
be raised the third day.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he said to them all, If any man will 
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow 
me.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever 
will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.<BR>[<B>25</B>] For what 
is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast 
away?<BR>[<B>26</B>] For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of 
him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in 
his Father's, and of the holy angels.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But I tell you of a truth, 
there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the 
kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And it came to pass about an eight days after 
these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to 
pray.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was 
altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And, behold, 
there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:<BR>[<B>31</B>] Who 
appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>32</B>] But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with 
sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood 
with him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter 
said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three 
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing 
what he said.<BR>[<B>34</B>] While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and 
overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the 
cloud.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is 
my beloved Son: hear him.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And when the voice was past, Jesus was 
found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those 
things which they had seen.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And it came to pass, that on the next 
day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.<BR>[<B>38</B>] 
And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, 
look upon my son: for he is mine only child.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And, lo, a spirit 
taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth 
again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And I besought 
thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And Jesus 
answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with 
you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And as he was yet a 
coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean 
spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his 
father.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But 
while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his 
disciples,<BR>[<B>44</B>] Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the 
Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.<BR>[<B>45</B>] But they 
understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it 
not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.<BR>[<B>46</B>] Then there arose 
a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And 
Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by 
him,<BR>[<B>48</B>] And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my 
name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: 
for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And 
John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and 
we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.<BR>[<B>50</B>] And Jesus said 
unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for 
us.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be 
received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,<BR>[<B>52</B>] And 
sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of 
the Samaritans, to make ready for him.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And they did not receive 
him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And 
when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we 
command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias 
did?<BR>[<B>55</B>] But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what 
manner of spirit ye are of.<BR>[<B>56</B>] For the Son of man is not come to 
destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another 
village.<BR>[<B>57</B>] And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a 
certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou 
goest.<BR>[<B>58</B>] And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of 
the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his 
head.<BR>[<B>59</B>] And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, 
suffer me first to go and bury my father.<BR>[<B>60</B>] Jesus said unto him, 
Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of 
God.<BR>[<B>61</B>] And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me 
first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.<BR>[<B>62</B>] And 
Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking 
back, is fit for the kingdom of God.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] After these things the Lord appointed other seventy 
also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, 
whither he himself would come.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Therefore said he unto them, The 
harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of 
the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the 
way.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to 
this house.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall 
rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And in the same 
house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is 
worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And into 
whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set 
before you:<BR>[<B>9</B>] And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, 
The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.<BR>[<B>10</B>] But into whatsoever 
city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of 
the same, and say,<BR>[<B>11</B>] Even the very dust of your city, which 
cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, 
that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But I say unto 
you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that 
city.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if 
the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, 
they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and 
ashes.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the 
judgment, than for you.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to 
heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.<BR>[<B>16</B>] He that heareth you heareth 
me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth 
him that sent me.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And the seventy returned again with joy, 
saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy 
name.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall 
from heaven.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents 
and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any 
means hurt you.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the 
spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written 
in heaven.<BR>[<B>21</B>] In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I 
thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things 
from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; 
for so it seemed good in thy sight.<BR>[<B>22</B>] All things are delivered to 
me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the 
Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.<BR>[<B>23</B>] 
And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes 
which see the things that ye see:<BR>[<B>24</B>] For I tell you, that many 
prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not 
seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard 
them.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, 
saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<BR>[<B>26</B>] He said 
unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he 
answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with 
all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy 
neighbour as thyself.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And he said unto him, Thou hast answered 
right: this do, and thou shalt live.<BR>[<B>29</B>] But he, willing to justify 
himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Jesus 
answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell 
among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, 
leaving him half dead.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And by chance there came down a certain 
priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other 
side.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and 
looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<BR>[<B>33</B>] But a certain 
Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had 
compassion on him,<BR>[<B>34</B>] And went to him, and bound up his wounds, 
pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an 
inn, and took care of him.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And on the morrow when he departed, he 
took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of 
him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay 
thee.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto 
him that fell among the thieves?<BR>[<B>37</B>] And he said, He that shewed 
mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<BR>[<B>38</B>] 
Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a 
certain woman named Martha received him into her house.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And she 
had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his 
word.<BR>[<B>40</B>] But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to 
him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve 
alone? bid her therefore that she help me.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And Jesus answered and 
said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many 
things:<BR>[<B>42</B>] But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good 
part, which shall not be taken away from her.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a 
certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach 
us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he said unto 
them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. 
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Give us day by day our daily bread.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And forgive us our sins; for 
we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into 
temptation; but deliver us from evil.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he said unto them, Which 
of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, 
Friend, lend me three loaves;<BR>[<B>6</B>] For a friend of mine in his journey 
is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he from 
within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my 
children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<BR>[<B>8</B>] I say 
unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet 
because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he 
needeth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, 
and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For 
every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that 
knocketh it shall be opened.<BR>[<B>11</B>] If a son shall ask bread of any of 
you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for 
a fish give him a serpent?<BR>[<B>12</B>] Or if he shall ask an egg, will he 
offer him a scorpion?<BR>[<B>13</B>] If ye then, being evil, know how to give 
good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the 
Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<BR>[<B>14</B>] And he was casting out a devil, 
and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb 
spake; and the people wondered.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But some of them said, He casteth 
out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And others, 
tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But he, knowing 
their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought 
to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.<BR>[<B>18</B>] If 
Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye 
say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And if I by 
Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall 
they be your judges.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But if I with the finger of God cast out 
devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.<BR>[<B>21</B>] When a 
strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:<BR>[<B>22</B>] But 
when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from 
him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.<BR>[<B>23</B>] 
He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me 
scattereth.<BR>[<B>24</B>] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he 
walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will 
return unto my house whence I came out.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And when he cometh, he 
findeth it swept and garnished.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Then goeth he, and taketh to him 
seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell 
there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.<BR>[<B>27</B>] 
And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company 
lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and 
the paps which thou hast sucked.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But he said, Yea rather, blessed 
are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And when the 
people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil 
generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign 
of Jonas the prophet.<BR>[<B>30</B>] For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, 
so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.<BR>[<B>31</B>] The queen of 
the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and 
condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom 
of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.<BR>[<B>32</B>] The men 
of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn 
it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than 
Jonas is here.<BR>[<B>33</B>] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it 
in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which 
come in may see the light.<BR>[<B>34</B>] The light of the body is the eye: 
therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but 
when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Take 
heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole 
shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee 
light.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine 
with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And when the 
Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before 
dinner.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make 
clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of 
ravening and wickedness.<BR>[<B>40</B>] Ye fools, did not he that made that 
which is without make that which is within also?<BR>[<B>41</B>] But rather give 
alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto 
you.<BR>[<B>42</B>] But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and 
all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye 
to have done, and not to leave the other undone.<BR>[<B>43</B>] Woe unto you, 
Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in 
the markets.<BR>[<B>44</B>] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for 
ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware 
of them.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, 
Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And he said, Woe 
unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, 
and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.<BR>[<B>47</B>] 
Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers 
killed them.<BR>[<B>48</B>] Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of 
your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their 
sepulchres.<BR>[<B>49</B>] Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send 
them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and 
persecute:<BR>[<B>50</B>] That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed 
from the foundation of the world, may be required of this 
generation;<BR>[<B>51</B>] From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, 
which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall 
be required of this generation.<BR>[<B>52</B>] Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye 
have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them 
that were entering in ye hindered.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And as he said these things 
unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to 
provoke him to speak of many things:<BR>[<B>54</B>] Laying wait for him, and 
seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] In the mean time, when there were gathered together 
an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, 
he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the 
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For there is nothing covered, that 
shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and 
that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the 
housetops.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them 
that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed 
hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Are 
not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten 
before God?<BR>[<B>7</B>] But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Also 
I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man 
also confess before the angels of God:<BR>[<B>9</B>] But he that denieth me 
before men shall be denied before the angels of God.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And 
whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: 
but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be 
forgiven.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto 
magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, 
or what ye shall say:<BR>[<B>12</B>] For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the 
same hour what ye ought to say.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And one of the company said unto 
him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with 
me.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider 
over you?<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of 
covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things 
which he possesseth.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he spake a parable unto them, saying, 
The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And 
he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where 
to bestow my fruits?<BR>[<B>18</B>] And he said, This will I do: I will pull 
down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my 
goods.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid 
up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But 
God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: 
then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?<BR>[<B>21</B>] So is 
he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward 
God.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, 
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye 
shall put on.<BR>[<B>23</B>] The life is more than meat, and the body is more 
than raiment.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; 
which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are 
ye better than the fowls?<BR>[<B>25</B>] And which of you with taking thought 
can add to his stature one cubit?<BR>[<B>26</B>] If ye then be not able to do 
that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?<BR>[<B>27</B>] 
Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say 
unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of 
these.<BR>[<B>28</B>] If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the 
field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O 
ye of little faith?<BR>[<B>29</B>] And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye 
shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.<BR>[<B>30</B>] For all these things 
do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have 
need of these things.<BR>[<B>31</B>] But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and 
all these things shall be added unto you.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Fear not, little flock; 
for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.<BR>[<B>33</B>] 
Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a 
treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither 
moth corrupteth.<BR>[<B>34</B>] For where your treasure is, there will your 
heart be also.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Let your loins be girded about, and your lights 
burning;<BR>[<B>36</B>] And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their 
lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, 
they may open unto him immediately.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Blessed are those servants, 
whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he 
shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and 
serve them.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in 
the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.<BR>[<B>39</B>] 
And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief 
would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken 
through.<BR>[<B>40</B>] Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at 
an hour when ye think not.<BR>[<B>41</B>] Then Peter said unto him, Lord, 
speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?<BR>[<B>42</B>] And the Lord 
said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler 
over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due 
season?<BR>[<B>43</B>] Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh 
shall find so doing.<BR>[<B>44</B>] Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make 
him ruler over all that he hath.<BR>[<B>45</B>] But and if that servant say in 
his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants 
and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;<BR>[<B>46</B>] The lord of 
that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when 
he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion 
with the unbelievers.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And that servant, which knew his lord's 
will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be 
beaten with many stripes.<BR>[<B>48</B>] But he that knew not, and did commit 
things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever 
much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed 
much, of him they will ask the more.<BR>[<B>49</B>] I am come to send fire on 
the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?<BR>[<B>50</B>] But I have a 
baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be 
accomplished!<BR>[<B>51</B>] Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I 
tell you, Nay; but rather division:<BR>[<B>52</B>] For from henceforth there 
shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against 
three.<BR>[<B>53</B>] The father shall be divided against the son, and the son 
against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against 
the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in 
law against her mother in law.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And he said also to the people, 
When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a 
shower; and so it is.<BR>[<B>55</B>] And when ye see the south wind blow, ye 
say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.<BR>[<B>56</B>] Ye hypocrites, ye 
can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not 
discern this time?<BR>[<B>57</B>] Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not 
what is right?<BR>[<B>58</B>] When thou goest with thine adversary to the 
magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered 
from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the 
officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.<BR>[<B>59</B>] I tell thee, thou 
shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] There were present at that season some that told him 
of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their 
sacrifices.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that 
these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered 
such things?<BR>[<B>3</B>] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all 
likewise perish.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam 
fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in 
Jerusalem?<BR>[<B>5</B>] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all 
likewise perish.<BR>[<B>6</B>] He spake also this parable; A certain man had a 
fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and 
found none.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, 
these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it 
down; why cumbereth it the ground?<BR>[<B>8</B>] And he answering said unto him, 
Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung 
it:<BR>[<B>9</B>] And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou 
shalt cut it down.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he was teaching in one of the synagogues 
on the sabbath.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit 
of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift 
up herself.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and 
said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified 
God.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, 
because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, 
There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be 
healed, and not on the sabbath day.<BR>[<B>15</B>] The Lord then answered him, 
and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox 
or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?<BR>[<B>16</B>] And 
ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, 
these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath 
day?<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were 
ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done 
by him.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and 
whereunto shall I resemble it?<BR>[<B>19</B>] It is like a grain of mustard 
seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great 
tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?<BR>[<B>21</B>] It is 
like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the 
whole was leavened.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he went through the cities and villages, 
teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Then said one unto 
him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,<BR>[<B>24</B>] 
Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to 
enter in, and shall not be able.<BR>[<B>25</B>] When once the master of the 
house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and 
to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and 
say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:<BR>[<B>26</B>] Then shall ye begin 
to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our 
streets.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye 
are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<BR>[<B>28</B>] There shall be 
weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, 
and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust 
out.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and 
from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of 
God.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there 
are first which shall be last.<BR>[<B>31</B>] The same day there came certain of 
the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will 
kill thee.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, 
Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third 
day I shall be perfected.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to 
morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>34</B>] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, 
and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy 
children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would 
not!<BR>[<B>35</B>] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I 
say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, 
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one 
of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched 
him.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the 
dropsy.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, 
saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?<BR>[<B>4</B>] And they held 
their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a 
pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?<BR>[<B>6</B>] And 
they could not answer him again to these things.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he put forth 
a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the 
chief rooms; saying unto them,<BR>[<B>8</B>] When thou art bidden of any man to 
a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than 
thou be bidden of him;<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he that bade thee and him come and say 
to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest 
room.<BR>[<B>10</B>] But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest 
room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up 
higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat 
with thee.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he 
that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then said he also to him 
that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor 
thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid 
thee again, and a recompence be made thee.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But when thou makest a 
feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:<BR>[<B>14</B>] And thou 
shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed 
at the resurrection of the just.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And when one of them that sat at 
meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat 
bread in the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then said he unto him, A certain man 
made a great supper, and bade many:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And sent his servant at 
supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now 
ready.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The 
first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and 
see it: I pray thee have me excused.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And another said, I have 
bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me 
excused.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I 
cannot come.<BR>[<B>21</B>] So that servant came, and shewed his lord these 
things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out 
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, 
and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the servant 
said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is 
room.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the 
highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be 
filled.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For I say unto you, That none of those men which were 
bidden shall taste of my supper.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And there went great multitudes 
with him: and he turned, and said unto them,<BR>[<B>26</B>] If any man come to 
me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, 
and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my 
disciple.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after 
me, cannot be my disciple.<BR>[<B>28</B>] For which of you, intending to build a 
tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient 
to finish it?<BR>[<B>29</B>] Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and 
is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,<BR>[<B>30</B>] 
Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Or 
what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and 
consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against 
him with twenty thousand?<BR>[<B>32</B>] Or else, while the other is yet a great 
way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of 
peace.<BR>[<B>33</B>] So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all 
that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Salt is good: but if the 
salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?<BR>[<B>35</B>] It is 
neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that 
hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners 
for to hear him.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, 
This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he spake 
this parable unto them, saying,<BR>[<B>4</B>] What man of you, having an hundred 
sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the 
wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<BR>[<B>6</B>] 
And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying 
unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was 
lost.<BR>[<B>7</B>] I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over 
one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which 
need no repentance.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, 
if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek 
diligently till she find it?<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when she hath found it, she 
calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I 
have found the piece which I had lost.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Likewise, I say unto you, 
there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that 
repenteth.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he said, A certain man had two 
sons:<BR>[<B>12</B>] And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me 
the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his 
living.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And not many days after the younger son gathered all 
together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his 
substance with riotous living.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when he had spent all, there 
arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him 
into his fields to feed swine.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he would fain have filled his 
belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto 
him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired 
servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with 
hunger!<BR>[<B>18</B>] I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, 
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,<BR>[<B>19</B>] And am no 
more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired 
servants.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was 
yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell 
on his neck, and kissed him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the son said unto him, Father, I 
have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called 
thy son.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the 
best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his 
feet:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us 
eat, and be merry:<BR>[<B>24</B>] For this my son was dead, and is alive again; 
he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Now his 
elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard 
musick and dancing.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And he called one of the servants, and asked 
what these things meant.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he said unto him, Thy brother is 
come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him 
safe and sound.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore 
came his father out, and intreated him.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he answering said to 
his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any 
time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make 
merry with my friends:<BR>[<B>30</B>] But as soon as this thy son was come, 
which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted 
calf.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all 
that I have is thine.<BR>[<B>32</B>] It was meet that we should make merry, and 
be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is 
found.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he said also unto his disciples, There was a 
certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he 
had wasted his goods.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he called him, and said unto him, How is 
it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest 
be no longer steward.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Then the steward said within himself, What 
shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to 
beg I am ashamed.<BR>[<B>4</B>] I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put 
out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<BR>[<B>5</B>] So 
he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How 
much owest thou unto my lord?<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he said, An hundred measures of 
oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write 
fifty.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he 
said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and 
write fourscore.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the lord commended the unjust steward, 
because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their 
generation wiser than the children of light.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And I say unto you, 
Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, 
they may receive you into everlasting habitations.<BR>[<B>10</B>] He that is 
faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust 
in the least is unjust also in much.<BR>[<B>11</B>] If therefore ye have not 
been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true 
riches?<BR>[<B>12</B>] And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another 
man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<BR>[<B>13</B>] No servant can 
serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else 
he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and 
mammon.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all 
these things: and they derided him.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he said unto them, Ye are 
they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that 
which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of 
God.<BR>[<B>16</B>] The law and the prophets were until John: since that time 
the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.<BR>[<B>17</B>] 
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to 
fail.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, 
committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her 
husband committeth adultery.<BR>[<B>19</B>] There was a certain rich man, which 
was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every 
day:<BR>[<B>20</B>] And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid 
at his gate, full of sores,<BR>[<B>21</B>] And desiring to be fed with the 
crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked 
his sores.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was 
carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was 
buried;<BR>[<B>23</B>] And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and 
seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And he cried 
and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip 
the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this 
flame.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime 
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is 
comforted, and thou art tormented.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And beside all this, between 
us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence 
to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from 
thence.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou 
wouldest send him to my father's house:<BR>[<B>28</B>] For I have five brethren; 
that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of 
torment.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the 
prophets; let them hear them.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: 
but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he 
said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be 
persuaded, though one rose from the dead.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.17</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but 
that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast 
into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and 
if he repent, forgive him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And if he trespass against thee seven 
times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; 
thou shalt forgive him.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And the apostles said unto the Lord, 
Increase our faith.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain 
of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the 
root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But 
which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by 
and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?<BR>[<B>8</B>] 
And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird 
thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt 
eat and drink?<BR>[<B>9</B>] Doth he thank that servant because he did the 
things that were commanded him? I trow not.<BR>[<B>10</B>] So likewise ye, when 
ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are 
unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to 
do.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed 
through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And as he entered into 
a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar 
off:<BR>[<B>13</B>] And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, 
have mercy on us.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go 
shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they 
were cleansed.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, 
turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,<BR>[<B>16</B>] And fell down 
on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a 
Samaritan.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? 
but where are the nine?<BR>[<B>18</B>] There are not found that returned to give 
glory to God, save this stranger.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he said unto him, Arise, go 
thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And when he was demanded 
of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and 
said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:<BR>[<B>21</B>] Neither 
shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within 
you.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye 
shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see 
it.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not 
after them, nor follow them.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For as the lightning, that 
lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under 
heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But first 
must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of 
man.<BR>[<B>27</B>] They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were 
given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood 
came, and destroyed them all.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Likewise also as it was in the days 
of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they 
builded;<BR>[<B>29</B>] But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained 
fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Even thus 
shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.<BR>[<B>31</B>] In that 
day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him 
not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not 
return back.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Remember Lot's wife.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Whosoever shall 
seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall 
preserve it.<BR>[<B>34</B>] I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in 
one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Two 
women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other 
left.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and 
the other left.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? 
And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be 
gathered together.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.18</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that 
men ought always to pray, and not to faint;<BR>[<B>2</B>] Saying, There was in a 
city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:<BR>[<B>3</B>] And 
there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine 
adversary.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he would not for a while: but afterward he said 
within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<BR>[<B>5</B>] Yet because 
this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she 
weary me.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge 
saith.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and 
night unto him, though he bear long with them?<BR>[<B>8</B>] I tell you that he 
will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he 
find faith on the earth?<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he spake this parable unto certain 
which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised 
others:<BR>[<B>10</B>] Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a 
Pharisee, and the other a publican.<BR>[<B>11</B>] The Pharisee stood and prayed 
thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, 
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.<BR>[<B>12</B>] I 
fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto 
heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a 
sinner.<BR>[<B>14</B>] I tell you, this man went down to his house justified 
rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and 
he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And they brought unto 
him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they 
rebuked them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer 
little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom 
of God.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the 
kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit 
eternal life?<BR>[<B>19</B>] And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? 
none is good, save one, that is, God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Thou knowest the 
commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear 
false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he said, All 
these have I kept from my youth up.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Now when Jesus heard these 
things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, 
and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, 
follow me.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he 
was very rich.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he 
said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of 
God!<BR>[<B>25</B>] For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, 
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they 
that heard it said, Who then can be saved?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he said, The 
things which are impossible with men are possible with God.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Then 
Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he said 
unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or 
parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's 
sake,<BR>[<B>30</B>] Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, 
and in the world to come life everlasting.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Then he took unto him 
the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things 
that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be 
accomplished.<BR>[<B>32</B>] For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and 
shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:<BR>[<B>33</B>] And 
they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise 
again.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And they understood none of these things: and this saying 
was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were 
spoken.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto 
Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:<BR>[<B>36</B>] And 
hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And they 
told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he cried, 
saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And they 
which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so 
much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And Jesus 
stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he 
asked him,<BR>[<B>41</B>] Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And 
he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And Jesus said unto 
him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And 
immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the 
people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.19</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Jesus entered and passed through 
Jericho.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was 
the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he sought to 
see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of 
stature.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to 
see him: for he was to pass that way.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when Jesus came to the 
place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and 
come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he made 
haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when they saw 
it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a 
sinner.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, 
the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any 
man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And Jesus said 
unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a 
son of Abraham.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For the Son of man is come to seek and to save 
that which was lost.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And as they heard these things, he added and 
spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that 
the kingdom of God should immediately appear.<BR>[<B>12</B>] He said therefore, 
A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and 
to return.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten 
pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But his citizens 
hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to 
reign over us.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And it came to pass, that when he was returned, 
having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto 
him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had 
gained by trading.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound 
hath gained ten pounds.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he said unto him, Well, thou good 
servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority 
over ten cities.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound 
hath gained five pounds.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he said likewise to him, Be thou 
also over five cities.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And another came, saying, Lord, behold, 
here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:<BR>[<B>21</B>] For I 
feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst 
not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he saith unto 
him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest 
that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I 
did not sow:<BR>[<B>23</B>] Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the 
bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with 
usury?<BR>[<B>24</B>] And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the 
pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.<BR>[<B>25</B>] (And they said 
unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)<BR>[<B>26</B>] For I say unto you, That 
unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that 
he hath shall be taken away from him.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But those mine enemies, 
which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them 
before me.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending 
up to Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to 
Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of 
his disciples,<BR>[<B>30</B>] Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; 
in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man 
sat: loose him, and bring him hither.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And if any man ask you, Why 
do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of 
him.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he 
had said unto them.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And as they were loosing the colt, the owners 
thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?<BR>[<B>34</B>] And they said, The 
Lord hath need of him.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And they brought him to Jesus: and they 
cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And when he 
was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole 
multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for 
all the mighty works that they had seen;<BR>[<B>38</B>] Saying, Blessed be the 
King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the 
highest.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said 
unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And he answered and said 
unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would 
immediately cry out.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And when he was come near, he beheld the 
city, and wept over it,<BR>[<B>42</B>] Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, 
at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they 
are hid from thine eyes.<BR>[<B>43</B>] For the days shall come upon thee, that 
thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep 
thee in on every side,<BR>[<B>44</B>] And shall lay thee even with the ground, 
and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon 
another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And 
he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them 
that bought;<BR>[<B>46</B>] Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the 
house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And he 
taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief 
of the people sought to destroy him,<BR>[<B>48</B>] And could not find what they 
might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.20</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he 
taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and 
the scribes came upon him with the elders,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And spake unto him, 
saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that 
gave thee this authority?<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he answered and said unto them, I 
will also ask you one thing; and answer me:<BR>[<B>4</B>] The baptism of John, 
was it from heaven, or of men?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And they reasoned with themselves, 
saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him 
not?<BR>[<B>6</B>] But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for 
they be persuaded that John was a prophet.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they answered, that 
they could not tell whence it was.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And Jesus said unto them, 
Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then began 
he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and 
let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long 
time.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that 
they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, 
and sent him away empty.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And again he sent another servant: and 
they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away 
empty.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and 
cast him out.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I 
do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see 
him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among 
themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the 
inheritance may be ours.<BR>[<B>15</B>] So they cast him out of the vineyard, 
and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto 
them?<BR>[<B>16</B>] He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give 
the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God 
forbid.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is 
written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of 
the corner?<BR>[<B>18</B>] Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; 
but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And 
the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and 
they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable 
against them.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which 
should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that 
so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the 
governor.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou 
sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but 
teachest the way of God truly:<BR>[<B>22</B>] Is it lawful for us to give 
tribute unto Caesar, or no?<BR>[<B>23</B>] But he perceived their craftiness, 
and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?<BR>[<B>24</B>] Shew me a penny. Whose image 
and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And 
he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, 
and unto God the things which be God's.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they could not take 
hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held 
their peace.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which 
deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,<BR>[<B>28</B>] Saying, 
Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die 
without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto 
his brother.<BR>[<B>29</B>] There were therefore seven brethren: and the first 
took a wife, and died without children.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And the second took her 
to wife, and he died childless.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And the third took her; and in 
like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.<BR>[<B>32</B>] 
Last of all the woman died also.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Therefore in the resurrection 
whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And Jesus 
answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in 
marriage:<BR>[<B>35</B>] But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that 
world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in 
marriage:<BR>[<B>36</B>] Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto 
the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the 
resurrection.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at 
the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and 
the God of Jacob.<BR>[<B>38</B>] For he is not a God of the dead, but of the 
living: for all live unto him.<BR>[<B>39</B>] Then certain of the scribes 
answering said, Master, thou hast well said.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And after that they 
durst not ask him any question at all.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And he said unto them, How 
say they that Christ is David's son?<BR>[<B>42</B>] And David himself saith in 
the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right 
hand,<BR>[<B>43</B>] Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.<BR>[<B>44</B>] 
David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?<BR>[<B>45</B>] Then in 
the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,<BR>[<B>46</B>] Beware 
of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the 
markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at 
feasts;<BR>[<B>47</B>] Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long 
prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.21</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their 
gifts into the treasury.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he saw also a certain poor widow 
casting in thither two mites.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he said, Of a truth I say unto 
you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:<BR>[<B>4</B>] For all 
these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her 
penury hath cast in all the living that she had.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And as some spake 
of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he 
said,<BR>[<B>6</B>] As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in 
the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be 
thrown down.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall 
these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to 
pass?<BR>[<B>8</B>] And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many 
shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not 
therefore after them.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But when ye shall hear of wars and 
commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the 
end is not by and by.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise 
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:<BR>[<B>11</B>] And great 
earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful 
sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But before all 
these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up 
to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for 
my name's sake.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And it shall turn to you for a 
testimony.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate 
before what ye shall answer:<BR>[<B>15</B>] For I will give you a mouth and 
wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor 
resist.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, 
and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to 
death.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's 
sake.<BR>[<B>18</B>] But there shall not an hair of your head 
perish.<BR>[<B>19</B>] In your patience possess ye your souls.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the 
desolation thereof is nigh.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Then let them which are in Judaea 
flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and 
let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For these 
be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be 
fulfilled.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But woe unto them that are with child, and to them 
that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, 
and wrath upon this people.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And they shall fall by the edge of 
the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall 
be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be 
fulfilled.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, 
and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the 
sea and the waves roaring;<BR>[<B>26</B>] Men's hearts failing them for fear, 
and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers 
of heaven shall be shaken.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And then shall they see the Son of man 
coming in a cloud with power and great glory.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And when these 
things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your 
redemption draweth nigh.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he spake to them a parable; Behold 
the fig tree, and all the trees;<BR>[<B>30</B>] When they now shoot forth, ye 
see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.<BR>[<B>31</B>] 
So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom 
of God is nigh at hand.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Verily I say unto you, This generation 
shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Heaven and earth 
shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And take heed 
to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and 
drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you 
unawares.<BR>[<B>35</B>] For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on 
the face of the whole earth.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Watch ye therefore, and pray always, 
that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to 
pass, and to stand before the Son of man.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And in the day time he 
was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount 
that is called the mount of Olives.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And all the people came early 
in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.22</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is 
called the Passover.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the chief priests and scribes sought how 
they might kill him; for they feared the people.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Then entered 
Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the 
twelve.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests 
and captains, how he might betray him unto them.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And they were 
glad, and covenanted to give him money.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he promised, and 
sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the 
multitude.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the 
passover must be killed.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go 
and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they said unto 
him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he said unto them, 
Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a 
pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, 
Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my 
disciples?<BR>[<B>12</B>] And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: 
there make ready.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And they went, and found as he had said unto 
them: and they made ready the passover.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when the hour was 
come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he said 
unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I 
suffer:<BR>[<B>16</B>] For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, 
until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he took the cup, 
and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among 
yourselves:<BR>[<B>18</B>] For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of 
the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he took bread, 
and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which 
is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Likewise also the 
cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is 
shed for you.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is 
with me on the table.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was 
determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!<BR>[<B>23</B>] And 
they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this 
thing.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And there was also a strife among them, which of them 
should be accounted the greatest.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And he said unto them, The 
kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise 
authority upon them are called benefactors.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But ye shall not be 
so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is 
chief, as he that doth serve.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For whether is greater, he that 
sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am 
among you as he that serveth.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Ye are they which have continued 
with me in my temptations.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as 
my Father hath appointed unto me;<BR>[<B>30</B>] That ye may eat and drink at my 
table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of 
Israel.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath 
desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:<BR>[<B>32</B>] But I have 
prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, 
strengthen thy brethren.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready 
to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And he said, I 
tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt 
thrice deny that thou knowest me.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And he said unto them, When I 
sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they 
said, Nothing.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a 
purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let 
him sell his garment, and buy one.<BR>[<B>37</B>] For I say unto you, that this 
that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the 
transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And they 
said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is 
enough.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount 
of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And when he was 
at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into 
temptation.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, 
and kneeled down, and prayed,<BR>[<B>42</B>] Saying, Father, if thou be willing, 
remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be 
done.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, 
strengthening him.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And being in an agony he prayed more 
earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the 
ground.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his 
disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,<BR>[<B>46</B>] And said unto them, 
Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And 
while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the 
twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.<BR>[<B>48</B>] 
But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a 
kiss?<BR>[<B>49</B>] When they which were about him saw what would follow, they 
said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?<BR>[<B>50</B>] And one of 
them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right 
ear.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he 
touched his ear, and healed him.<BR>[<B>52</B>] Then Jesus said unto the chief 
priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be 
ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?<BR>[<B>53</B>] When I 
was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but 
this is your hour, and the power of darkness.<BR>[<B>54</B>] Then took they him, 
and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed 
afar off.<BR>[<B>55</B>] And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the 
hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.<BR>[<B>56</B>] But 
a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, 
and said, This man was also with him.<BR>[<B>57</B>] And he denied him, saying, 
Woman, I know him not.<BR>[<B>58</B>] And after a little while another saw him, 
and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.<BR>[<B>59</B>] 
And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a 
truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.<BR>[<B>60</B>] And 
Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet 
spake, the cock crew.<BR>[<B>61</B>] And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. 
And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the 
cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>[<B>62</B>] And Peter went out, and 
wept bitterly.<BR>[<B>63</B>] And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote 
him.<BR>[<B>64</B>] And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the 
face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?<BR>[<B>65</B>] 
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.<BR>[<B>66</B>] And 
as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the 
scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,<BR>[<B>67</B>] 
Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not 
believe:<BR>[<B>68</B>] And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me 
go.<BR>[<B>69</B>] Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the 
power of God.<BR>[<B>70</B>] Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? 
And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.<BR>[<B>71</B>] And they said, What need 
we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.23</H3>[<B>1</B>] And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him 
unto Pilate.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this 
fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying 
that he himself is Christ a King.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And Pilate asked him, saying, 
Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest 
it.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I 
find no fault in this man.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And they were the more fierce, saying, 
He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee 
to this place.<BR>[<B>6</B>] When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the 
man were a Galilaean.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto 
Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at 
that time.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he 
was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of 
him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then he 
questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused 
him.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked 
him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to 
Pilate.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends 
together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the 
people,<BR>[<B>14</B>] Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one 
that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have 
found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse 
him:<BR>[<B>15</B>] No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing 
worthy of death is done unto him.<BR>[<B>16</B>] I will therefore chastise him, 
and release him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] (For of necessity he must release one unto them 
at the feast.)<BR>[<B>18</B>] And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with 
this man, and release unto us Barabbas:<BR>[<B>19</B>] (Who for a certain 
sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he said 
unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of 
death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And 
they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And 
the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And Pilate 
gave sentence that it should be as they required.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And he released 
unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had 
desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And as they led 
him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, 
and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And there followed him a great company of people, and of 
women, which also bewailed and lamented him.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But Jesus turning 
unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for 
yourselves, and for your children.<BR>[<B>29</B>] For, behold, the days are 
coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that 
never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Then shall they 
begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover 
us.<BR>[<B>31</B>] For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be 
done in the dry?<BR>[<B>32</B>] And there were also two other, malefactors, led 
with him to be put to death.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And when they were come to the 
place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, 
one on the right hand, and the other on the left.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Then said 
Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his 
raiment, and cast lots.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And the people stood beholding. And the 
rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save 
himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And the soldiers 
also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,<BR>[<B>37</B>] And 
saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And a 
superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and 
Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And one of the malefactors 
which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and 
us.<BR>[<B>40</B>] But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou 
fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<BR>[<B>41</B>] And we indeed 
justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done 
nothing amiss.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when 
thou comest into thy kingdom.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And Jesus said unto him, Verily I 
say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And it 
was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the 
ninth hour.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple 
was rent in the midst.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And when Jesus had cried with a loud 
voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said 
thus, he gave up the ghost.<BR>[<B>47</B>] Now when the centurion saw what was 
done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous 
man.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And all the people that came together to that sight, 
beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and 
returned.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed 
him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.<BR>[<B>50</B>] And, 
behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a 
just:<BR>[<B>51</B>] (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of 
them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the 
kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>52</B>] This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it 
in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was 
laid.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew 
on.<BR>[<B>55</B>] And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, 
followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was 
laid.<BR>[<B>56</B>] And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and 
rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Luke.24</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the 
morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had 
prepared, and certain others with them.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And they found the stone 
rolled away from the sepulchre.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And they entered in, and found not 
the body of the Lord Jesus.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And it came to pass, as they were much 
perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining 
garments:<BR>[<B>5</B>] And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to 
the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the 
dead?<BR>[<B>6</B>] He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you 
when he was yet in Galilee,<BR>[<B>7</B>] Saying, The Son of man must be 
delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise 
again.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they remembered his words,<BR>[<B>9</B>] And returned 
from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the 
rest.<BR>[<B>10</B>] It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of 
James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the 
apostles.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they 
believed them not.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; 
and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, 
wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And, behold, 
two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from 
Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And they talked together of 
all these things which had happened.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And it came to pass, that, 
while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went 
with them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But their eyes were holden that they should not know 
him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he said unto them, What manner of communications are 
these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<BR>[<B>18</B>] And 
the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only 
a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass 
therein these days?<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he said unto them, What things? And they 
said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed 
and word before God and all the people:<BR>[<B>20</B>] And how the chief priests 
and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified 
him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But we trusted that it had been he which should have 
redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things 
were done.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Yea, and certain women also of our company made us 
astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when they 
found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of 
angels, which said that he was alive.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And certain of them which 
were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: 
but him they saw not.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow 
of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<BR>[<B>26</B>] Ought not 
Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his 
glory?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded 
unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<BR>[<B>28</B>] 
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he 
would have gone further.<BR>[<B>29</B>] But they constrained him, saying, Abide 
with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to 
tarry with them.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with 
them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<BR>[<B>31</B>] 
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their 
sight.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn 
within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the 
scriptures?<BR>[<B>33</B>] And they rose up the same hour, and returned to 
Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with 
them,<BR>[<B>34</B>] Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to 
Simon.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And they told what things were done in the way, and how he 
was known of them in breaking of bread.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And as they thus spake, 
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto 
you.<BR>[<B>37</B>] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that 
they had seen a spirit.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he said unto them, Why are ye 
troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?<BR>[<B>39</B>] Behold my 
hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath 
not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And when he had thus 
spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And while they yet 
believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any 
meat?<BR>[<B>42</B>] And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an 
honeycomb.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And he took it, and did eat before 
them.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake 
unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which 
were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, 
concerning me.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Then opened he their understanding, that they 
might understand the scriptures,<BR>[<B>46</B>] And said unto them, Thus it is 
written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the 
third day:<BR>[<B>47</B>] And that repentance and remission of sins should be 
preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>48</B>] 
And ye are witnesses of these things.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And, behold, I send the 
promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye 
be endued with power from on high.<BR>[<B>50</B>] And he led them out as far as 
to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And it 
came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up 
into heaven.<BR>[<B>52</B>] And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem 
with great joy:<BR>[<B>53</B>] And were continually in the temple, praising and 
blessing God. Amen.<BR>
