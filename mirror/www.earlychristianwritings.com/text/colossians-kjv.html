<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Colossians</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Col.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, 
and Timotheus our brother,<BR>[<B>2</B>] To the saints and faithful brethren in 
Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father 
and the Lord Jesus Christ.<BR>[<B>3</B>] We give thanks to God and the Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,<BR>[<B>4</B>] Since we heard of 
your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the 
saints,<BR>[<B>5</B>] For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof 
ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;<BR>[<B>6</B>] Which is 
come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth 
also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in 
truth:<BR>[<B>7</B>] As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who 
is for you a faithful minister of Christ;<BR>[<B>8</B>] Who also declared unto 
us your love in the Spirit.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For this cause we also, since the day 
we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled 
with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual 
understanding;<BR>[<B>10</B>] That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all 
pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of 
God;<BR>[<B>11</B>] Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious 
power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the 
inheritance of the saints in light:<BR>[<B>13</B>] Who hath delivered us from 
the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear 
Son:<BR>[<B>14</B>] In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the 
forgiveness of sins:<BR>[<B>15</B>] Who is the image of the invisible God, the 
firstborn of every creature:<BR>[<B>16</B>] For by him were all things created, 
that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they 
be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created 
by him, and for him:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he is before all things, and by him all 
things consist.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And he is the head of the body, the church: who 
is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have 
the preeminence.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For it pleased the Father that in him should all 
fulness dwell;<BR>[<B>20</B>] And, having made peace through the blood of his 
cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they 
be things in earth, or things in heaven.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And you, that were 
sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he 
reconciled<BR>[<B>22</B>] In the body of his flesh through death, to present you 
holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:<BR>[<B>23</B>] If ye 
continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope 
of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature 
which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;<BR>[<B>24</B>] Who now 
rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the 
afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the 
church:<BR>[<B>25</B>] Whereof I am made a minister, according to the 
dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of 
God;<BR>[<B>26</B>] Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from 
generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:<BR>[<B>27</B>] To whom God 
would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the 
Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:<BR>[<B>28</B>] Whom we 
preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may 
present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:<BR>[<B>29</B>] Whereunto I also 
labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Col.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for 
you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the 
flesh;<BR>[<B>2</B>] That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together 
in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the 
acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of 
Christ;<BR>[<B>3</B>] In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and 
knowledge.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with 
enticing words.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with 
you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your 
faith in Christ.<BR>[<B>6</B>] As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the 
Lord, so walk ye in him:<BR>[<B>7</B>] Rooted and built up in him, and 
stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with 
thanksgiving.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and 
vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and 
not after Christ.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the 
Godhead bodily.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And ye are complete in him, which is the head of 
all principality and power:<BR>[<B>11</B>] In whom also ye are circumcised with 
the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the 
flesh by the circumcision of Christ:<BR>[<B>12</B>] Buried with him in baptism, 
wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, 
who hath raised him from the dead.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And you, being dead in your 
sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, 
having forgiven you all trespasses;<BR>[<B>14</B>] Blotting out the handwriting 
of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of 
the way, nailing it to his cross;<BR>[<B>15</B>] And having spoiled 
principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them 
in it.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in 
respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath 
days:<BR>[<B>17</B>] Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of 
Christ.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary 
humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath 
not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,<BR>[<B>19</B>] And not holding 
the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment 
ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of 
God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of 
the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to 
ordinances,<BR>[<B>21</B>] (Touch not; taste not; handle not;<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of 
men?<BR>[<B>23</B>] Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, 
and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of 
the flesh.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Col.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things 
which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<BR>[<B>4</B>] When 
Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in 
glory.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; 
fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and 
covetousness, which is idolatry:<BR>[<B>6</B>] For which things' sake the wrath 
of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<BR>[<B>7</B>] In the which ye 
also walked some time, when ye lived in them.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But now ye also put 
off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your 
mouth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old 
man with his deeds;<BR>[<B>10</B>] And have put on the new man, which is renewed 
in knowledge after the image of him that created him:<BR>[<B>11</B>] Where there 
is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, 
bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Put on therefore, 
as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness 
of mind, meekness, longsuffering;<BR>[<B>13</B>] Forbearing one another, and 
forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ 
forgave you, so also do ye.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And above all these things put on 
charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And let the peace of 
God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye 
thankful.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all 
wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual 
songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And 
whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving 
thanks to God and the Father by him.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Wives, submit yourselves 
unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Husbands, love 
your wives, and be not bitter against them.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Children, obey your 
parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be 
discouraged.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Servants, obey in all things your masters according 
to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, 
fearing God:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the 
Lord, and not unto men;<BR>[<B>24</B>] Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive 
the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But 
he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is 
no respect of persons.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Col.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and 
equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Continue in 
prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;<BR>[<B>3</B>] Withal praying 
also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the 
mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:<BR>[<B>4</B>] That I may make 
it manifest, as I ought to speak.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Walk in wisdom toward them that 
are without, redeeming the time.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Let your speech be alway with 
grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every 
man.<BR>[<B>7</B>] All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a 
beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the 
Lord:<BR>[<B>8</B>] Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he 
might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;<BR>[<B>9</B>] With Onesimus, a 
faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you 
all things which are done here.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Aristarchus my fellowprisoner 
saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received 
commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)<BR>[<B>11</B>] And Jesus, which 
is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers 
unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring 
fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the 
will of God.<BR>[<B>13</B>] For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for 
you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Luke, 
the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Salute the brethren 
which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his 
house.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be 
read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle 
from Laodicea.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry 
which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.<BR>[<B>18</B>] The 
salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. 
Amen.<BR>
