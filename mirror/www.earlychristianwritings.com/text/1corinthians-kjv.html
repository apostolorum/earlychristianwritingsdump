<P>
<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>1 Corinthians</H2>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through 
the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Unto the church of God 
which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be 
saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our 
Lord, both theirs and ours:<BR>[<B>3</B>] Grace be unto you, and peace, from God 
our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<BR>[<B>4</B>] I thank my God always 
on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus 
Christ;<BR>[<B>5</B>] That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all 
utterance, and in all knowledge;<BR>[<B>6</B>] Even as the testimony of Christ 
was confirmed in you:<BR>[<B>7</B>] So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting 
for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR>[<B>8</B>] Who shall also confirm 
you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus 
Christ.<BR>[<B>9</B>] God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the 
fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Now I beseech you, 
brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same 
thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined 
together in the same mind and in the same judgment.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For it hath 
been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of 
Chloe, that there are contentions among you.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now this I say, that 
every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I 
of Christ.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were 
ye baptized in the name of Paul?<BR>[<B>14</B>] I thank God that I baptized none 
of you, but Crispus and Gaius;<BR>[<B>15</B>] Lest any should say that I had 
baptized in mine own name.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And I baptized also the household of 
Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For 
Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of 
words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us 
which are saved it is the power of God.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For it is written, I will 
destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of 
the prudent.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the 
disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this 
world?<BR>[<B>21</B>] For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom 
knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that 
believe.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after 
wisdom:<BR>[<B>23</B>] But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a 
stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;<BR>[<B>24</B>] But unto them 
which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom 
of God.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the 
weakness of God is stronger than men.<BR>[<B>26</B>] For ye see your calling, 
brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many 
noble, are called:<BR>[<B>27</B>] But God hath chosen the foolish things of the 
world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to 
confound the things which are mighty;<BR>[<B>28</B>] And base things of the 
world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are 
not, to bring to nought things that are:<BR>[<B>29</B>] That no flesh should 
glory in his presence.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of 
God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and 
redemption:<BR>[<B>31</B>] That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, 
let him glory in the Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with 
excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of 
God.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus 
Christ, and him crucified.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And I was with you in weakness, and in 
fear, and in much trembling.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And my speech and my preaching was 
not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and 
of power:<BR>[<B>5</B>] That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, 
but in the power of God.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that 
are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, 
that come to nought:<BR>[<B>7</B>] But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, 
even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our 
glory:<BR>[<B>8</B>] Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they 
known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But as 
it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the 
heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love 
him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the 
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For 
what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? 
even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of 
God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of 
God.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's 
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things 
with spiritual.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But the natural man receiveth not the things of 
the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, 
because they are spiritually discerned.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But he that is spiritual 
judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.<BR>[<B>16</B>] For who 
hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind 
of Christ.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto 
spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.<BR>[<B>2</B>] I 
have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear 
it, neither yet now are ye able.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For ye are yet carnal: for 
whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not 
carnal, and walk as men?<BR>[<B>4</B>] For while one saith, I am of Paul; and 
another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?<BR>[<B>5</B>] Who then is Paul, and 
who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to 
every man?<BR>[<B>6</B>] I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the 
increase.<BR>[<B>7</B>] So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither 
he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Now he that 
planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own 
reward according to his own labour.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For we are labourers together 
with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I 
have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take 
heed how he buildeth thereupon.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For other foundation can no man 
lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now if any man 
build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, 
stubble;<BR>[<B>13</B>] Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day 
shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try 
every man's work of what sort it is.<BR>[<B>14</B>] If any man's work abide 
which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<BR>[<B>15</B>] If any 
man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; 
yet so as by fire.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and 
that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<BR>[<B>17</B>] If any man defile the 
temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which 
temple ye are.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you 
seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be 
wise.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For 
it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are 
vain.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are 
yours;<BR>[<B>22</B>] Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or 
life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are 
yours;<BR>[<B>23</B>] And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of 
Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Moreover it is 
required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But with me it 
is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, 
I judge not mine own self.<BR>[<B>4</B>] For I know nothing by myself; yet am I 
not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will 
bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the 
counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of 
God.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to 
myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of 
men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against 
another.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast 
thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou 
glory, as if thou hadst not received it?<BR>[<B>8</B>] Now ye are full, now ye 
are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, 
that we also might reign with you.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For I think that God hath set 
forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a 
spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.<BR>[<B>10</B>] We are fools 
for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye 
are honourable, but we are despised.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Even unto this present hour 
we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain 
dwellingplace;<BR>[<B>12</B>] And labour, working with our own hands: being 
reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:<BR>[<B>13</B>] Being defamed, 
we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of 
all things unto this day.<BR>[<B>14</B>] I write not these things to shame you, 
but as my beloved sons I warn you.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For though ye have ten 
thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ 
Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Wherefore I beseech 
you, be ye followers of me.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For this cause have I sent unto you 
Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you 
into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every 
church.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to 
you.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will 
know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.<BR>[<B>21</B>] What will 
ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of 
meekness?<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] It is reported commonly that there is fornication 
among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, 
that one should have his father's wife.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And ye are puffed up, and 
have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away 
from among you.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For I verily, as absent in body, but present in 
spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath 
so done this deed,<BR>[<B>4</B>] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye 
are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus 
Christ,<BR>[<B>5</B>] To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of 
the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord 
Jesus.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven 
leaveneth the whole lump?<BR>[<B>7</B>] Purge out therefore the old leaven, that 
ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is 
sacrificed for us:<BR>[<B>8</B>] Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old 
leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the 
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<BR>[<B>9</B>] I wrote unto you in an 
epistle not to company with fornicators:<BR>[<B>10</B>] Yet not altogether with 
the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with 
idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.<BR>[<B>11</B>] But now I 
have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother 
be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an 
extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For what have I to 
do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are 
within?<BR>[<B>13</B>] But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away 
from among yourselves that wicked person.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go 
to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?<BR>[<B>2</B>] Do ye not 
know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by 
you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?<BR>[<B>3</B>] Know ye not 
that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this 
life?<BR>[<B>4</B>] If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, 
set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.<BR>[<B>5</B>] I speak to 
your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that 
shall be able to judge between his brethren?<BR>[<B>6</B>] But brother goeth to 
law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Now therefore 
there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why 
do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be 
defrauded?<BR>[<B>8</B>] Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your 
brethren.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the 
kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor 
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with 
mankind,<BR>[<B>10</B>] Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, 
nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And such were 
some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in 
the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] All 
things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are 
lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and 
them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for 
the body.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also 
raise up us by his own power.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Know ye not that your bodies are 
the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them 
the members of an harlot? God forbid.<BR>[<B>16</B>] What? know ye not that he 
which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one 
flesh.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But he that is joined unto the Lord is one 
spirit.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without 
the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own 
body.<BR>[<B>19</B>] What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy 
Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your 
own?<BR>[<B>20</B>] For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in 
your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It 
is good for a man not to touch a woman.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Nevertheless, to avoid 
fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own 
husband.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and 
likewise also the wife unto the husband.<BR>[<B>4</B>] The wife hath not power 
of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power 
of his own body, but the wife.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Defraud ye not one the other, 
except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and 
prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your 
incontinency.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But I speak this by permission, and not of 
commandment.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For I would that all men were even as I myself. But 
every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after 
that.<BR>[<B>8</B>] I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for 
them if they abide even as I.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But if they cannot contain, let them 
marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And unto the 
married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her 
husband:<BR>[<B>11</B>] But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be 
reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his 
wife.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath 
a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put 
her away.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, 
and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife 
is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they 
holy.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or 
a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to 
peace.<BR>[<B>16</B>] For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy 
husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy 
wife?<BR>[<B>17</B>] But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath 
called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all 
churches.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become 
uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be 
circumcised.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is 
nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Let every 
man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Art thou 
called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it 
rather.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is 
the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's 
servant.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of 
men.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide 
with God.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the 
Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be 
faithful.<BR>[<B>26</B>] I suppose therefore that this is good for the present 
distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Art thou 
bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not 
a wife.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a 
virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the 
flesh: but I spare you.<BR>[<B>29</B>] But this I say, brethren, the time is 
short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had 
none;<BR>[<B>30</B>] And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that 
rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they 
possessed not;<BR>[<B>31</B>] And they that use this world, as not abusing it: 
for the fashion of this world passeth away.<BR>[<B>32</B>] But I would have you 
without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to 
the Lord, how he may please the Lord:<BR>[<B>33</B>] But he that is married 
careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his 
wife.<BR>[<B>34</B>] There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The 
unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in 
body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, 
how she may please her husband.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And this I speak for your own 
profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and 
that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.<BR>[<B>36</B>] But if any 
man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the 
flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: 
let them marry.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his 
heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so 
decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.<BR>[<B>38</B>] So 
then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in 
marriage doeth better.<BR>[<B>39</B>] The wife is bound by the law as long as 
her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married 
to whom she will; only in the Lord.<BR>[<B>40</B>] But she is happier if she so 
abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know 
that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity 
edifieth.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he 
knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But if any man love God, 
the same is known of him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] As concerning therefore the eating of 
those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is 
nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as 
there be gods many, and lords many,)<BR>[<B>6</B>] But to us there is but one 
God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus 
Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Howbeit there is 
not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this 
hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is 
defiled.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we 
eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to 
them that are weak.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For if any man see thee which hast knowledge 
sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak 
be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;<BR>[<B>11</B>] And 
through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ 
died?<BR>[<B>12</B>] But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their 
weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Wherefore, if meat make 
my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make 
my brother to offend.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen 
Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?<BR>[<B>2</B>] If I be not 
an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine 
apostleship are ye in the Lord.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Mine answer to them that do 
examine me is this,<BR>[<B>4</B>] Have we not power to eat and to 
drink?<BR>[<B>5</B>] Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well 
as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?<BR>[<B>6</B>] Or 
I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?<BR>[<B>7</B>] Who 
goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth 
not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of 
the flock?<BR>[<B>8</B>] Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the 
same also?<BR>[<B>9</B>] For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not 
muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for 
oxen?<BR>[<B>10</B>] Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no 
doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he 
that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.<BR>[<B>11</B>] If we have 
sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal 
things?<BR>[<B>12</B>] If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we 
rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we 
should hinder the gospel of Christ.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Do ye not know that they 
which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they 
which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?<BR>[<B>14</B>] Even so 
hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the 
gospel.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But I have used none of these things: neither have I 
written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for 
me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.<BR>[<B>16</B>] For 
though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid 
upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!<BR>[<B>17</B>] For if 
I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a 
dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.<BR>[<B>18</B>] What is my 
reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of 
Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.<BR>[<B>19</B>] 
For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that 
I might gain the more.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that 
I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I 
might gain them that are under the law;<BR>[<B>21</B>] To them that are without 
law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to 
Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.<BR>[<B>22</B>] To the weak 
became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, 
that I might by all means save some.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And this I do for the 
gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Know ye 
not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, 
that ye may obtain.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And every man that striveth for the mastery 
is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we 
an incorruptible.<BR>[<B>26</B>] I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so 
fight I, not as one that beateth the air:<BR>[<B>27</B>] But I keep under my 
body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached 
to others, I myself should be a castaway.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be 
ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through 
the sea;<BR>[<B>2</B>] And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the 
sea;<BR>[<B>3</B>] And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<BR>[<B>4</B>] And 
did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock 
that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But with many of 
them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the 
wilderness.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Now these things were our examples, to the intent we 
should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Neither be 
ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat 
and drink, and rose up to play.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Neither let us commit fornication, 
as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty 
thousand.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also 
tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Neither murmur ye, as 
some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for 
our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he 
fall.<BR>[<B>13</B>] There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to 
man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye 
are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be 
able to bear it.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from 
idolatry.<BR>[<B>15</B>] I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I 
say.<BR>[<B>16</B>] The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion 
of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the 
body of Christ?<BR>[<B>17</B>] For we being many are one bread, and one body: 
for we are all partakers of that one bread.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Behold Israel after 
the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the 
alter?<BR>[<B>19</B>] What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which 
is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?<BR>[<B>20</B>] But I say, that 
the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to 
God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be 
partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Do we 
provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?<BR>[<B>23</B>] All things 
are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for 
me, but all things edify not.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Let no man seek his own, but every 
man another's wealth.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that 
eat, asking no question for conscience sake:<BR>[<B>26</B>] For the earth is the 
Lord's, and the fulness thereof.<BR>[<B>27</B>] If any of them that believe not 
bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, 
asking no question for conscience sake.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But if any man say unto 
you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed 
it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness 
thereof:<BR>[<B>29</B>] Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for 
why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?<BR>[<B>30</B>] For if I by 
grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give 
thanks?<BR>[<B>31</B>] Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, 
do all to the glory of God.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Give none offence, neither to the 
Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:<BR>[<B>33</B>] Even as I 
please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of 
many, that they may be saved.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of 
Christ.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all 
things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But I 
would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the 
woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Every man praying 
or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth 
her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.<BR>[<B>6</B>] For if 
the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a 
woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For a man indeed 
ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but 
the woman is the glory of the man.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For the man is not of the 
woman; but the woman of the man.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Neither was the man created for 
the woman; but the woman for the man.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For this cause ought the 
woman to have power on her head because of the angels.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the 
man, in the Lord.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For as the woman is of the man, even so is the 
man also by the woman; but all things of god.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Judge in 
yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a 
shame unto him?<BR>[<B>15</B>] But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to 
her: for her hair is given her for a covering.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But if any man 
seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of 
God.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that 
ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For first 
of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions 
among you; and I partly believe it.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For there must be also 
heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among 
you.<BR>[<B>20</B>] When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not 
to eat the Lord's supper.<BR>[<B>21</B>] For in eating every one taketh before 
other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of 
God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you 
in this? I praise you not.<BR>[<B>23</B>] For I have received of the Lord that 
which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he 
was betrayed took bread:<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when he had given thanks, he brake 
it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in 
remembrance of me.<BR>[<B>25</B>] After the same manner also he took the cup, 
when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do 
ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<BR>[<B>26</B>] For as often as 
ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he 
come.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this 
cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the 
Lord.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that 
bread, and drink of that cup.<BR>[<B>29</B>] For he that eateth and drinketh 
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's 
body.<BR>[<B>30</B>] For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many 
sleep.<BR>[<B>31</B>] For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be 
judged.<BR>[<B>32</B>] But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, 
that we should not be condemned with the world.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Wherefore, my 
brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<BR>[<B>34</B>] 
And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto 
condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not 
have you ignorant.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away 
unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Wherefore I give you 
to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: 
and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy 
Ghost.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same 
Spirit.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And there are differences of administrations, but the same 
Lord.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same 
God which worketh all in all.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But the manifestation of the Spirit 
is given to every man to profit withal.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For to one is given by the 
Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same 
Spirit;<BR>[<B>9</B>] To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts 
of healing by the same Spirit;<BR>[<B>10</B>] To another the working of 
miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another 
divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of 
tongues:<BR>[<B>11</B>] But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, 
dividing to every man severally as he will.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For as the body is 
one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, 
are one body: so also is Christ.<BR>[<B>13</B>] For by one Spirit are we all 
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or 
free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For the 
body is not one member, but many.<BR>[<B>15</B>] If the foot shall say, Because 
I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the 
body?<BR>[<B>16</B>] And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am 
not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR>[<B>17</B>] If the whole 
body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were 
the smelling?<BR>[<B>18</B>] But now hath God set the members every one of them 
in the body, as it hath pleased him.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And if they were all one 
member, where were the body?<BR>[<B>20</B>] But now are they many members, yet 
but one body.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no 
need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of 
you.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be 
more feeble, are necessary:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And those members of the body, which 
we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and 
our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For our comely 
parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more 
abundant honour to that part which lacked:<BR>[<B>25</B>] That there should be 
no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for 
another.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer 
with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with 
it.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in 
particular.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, 
secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of 
healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Are all 
apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of 
miracles?<BR>[<B>30</B>] Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with 
tongues? do all interpret?<BR>[<B>31</B>] But covet earnestly the best gifts: 
and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, 
and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling 
cymbal.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all 
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could 
remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And though I 
bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, 
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Charity suffereth 
long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not 
puffed up,<BR>[<B>5</B>] Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, 
is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;<BR>[<B>6</B>] Rejoiceth not in 
iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;<BR>[<B>7</B>] Beareth all things, 
believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.<BR>[<B>8</B>] 
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether 
there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish 
away.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done 
away.<BR>[<B>11</B>] When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a 
child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish 
things.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to 
face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am 
known.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the 
greatest of these is charity.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but 
rather that ye may prophesy.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For he that speaketh in an unknown 
tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; 
howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But he that 
prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and 
comfort.<BR>[<B>4</B>] He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; 
but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.<BR>[<B>5</B>] I would that ye all 
spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that 
prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the 
church may receive edifying.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Now, brethren, if I come unto you 
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you 
either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by 
doctrine?<BR>[<B>7</B>] And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe 
or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known 
what is piped or harped?<BR>[<B>8</B>] For if the trumpet give an uncertain 
sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?<BR>[<B>9</B>] So likewise ye, 
except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known 
what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.<BR>[<B>10</B>] There are, it 
may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without 
signification.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, 
I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a 
barbarian unto me.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of 
spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the 
church.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray 
that he may interpret.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my 
spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.<BR>[<B>15</B>] What is it 
then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: 
I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding 
also.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he 
that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, 
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?<BR>[<B>17</B>] For thou verily 
givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.<BR>[<B>18</B>] I thank my God, 
I speak with tongues more than ye all:<BR>[<B>19</B>] Yet in the church I had 
rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach 
others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, 
but in understanding be men.<BR>[<B>21</B>] In the law it is written, With men 
of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all 
that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Wherefore tongues are 
for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but 
prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which 
believe.<BR>[<B>23</B>] If therefore the whole church be come together into one 
place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, 
or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?<BR>[<B>24</B>] But if all 
prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is 
convinced of all, he is judged of all:<BR>[<B>25</B>] And thus are the secrets 
of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, 
and report that God is in you of a truth.<BR>[<B>26</B>] How is it then, 
brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, 
hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done 
unto edifying.<BR>[<B>27</B>] If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be 
by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one 
interpret.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence 
in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Let the 
prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.<BR>[<B>30</B>] If any 
thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his 
peace.<BR>[<B>31</B>] For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, 
and all may be comforted.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And the spirits of the prophets are 
subject to the prophets.<BR>[<B>33</B>] For God is not the author of confusion, 
but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Let your women 
keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but 
they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is 
a shame for women to speak in the church.<BR>[<B>36</B>] What? came the word of 
God out from you? or came it unto you only?<BR>[<B>37</B>] If any man think 
himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that 
I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.<BR>[<B>38</B>] But if any man 
be ignorant, let him be ignorant.<BR>[<B>39</B>] Wherefore, brethren, covet to 
prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.<BR>[<B>40</B>] Let all things be 
done decently and in order.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel 
which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye 
stand;<BR>[<B>2</B>] By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I 
preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For I 
delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died 
for our sins according to the scriptures;<BR>[<B>4</B>] And that he was buried, 
and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:<BR>[<B>6</B>] After that, he 
was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain 
unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.<BR>[<B>7</B>] After that, he was 
seen of James; then of all the apostles.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And last of all he was 
seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For I am the 
least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I 
persecuted the church of God.<BR>[<B>10</B>] But by the grace of God I am what I 
am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured 
more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with 
me.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye 
believed.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, 
how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not 
risen:<BR>[<B>14</B>] And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, 
and your faith is also vain.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Yea, and we are found false 
witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: 
whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.<BR>[<B>16</B>] For if 
the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And if Christ be 
not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Then 
they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.<BR>[<B>19</B>] If in 
this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most 
miserable.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the 
firstfruits of them that slept.<BR>[<B>21</B>] For since by man came death, by 
man came also the resurrection of the dead.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For as in Adam all 
die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But every man in 
his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his 
coming.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the 
kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all 
authority and power.<BR>[<B>25</B>] For he must reign, till he hath put all 
enemies under his feet.<BR>[<B>26</B>] The last enemy that shall be destroyed is 
death.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he 
saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which 
did put all things under him.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And when all things shall be 
subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put 
all things under him, that God may be all in all.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Else what shall 
they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are 
they then baptized for the dead?<BR>[<B>30</B>] And why stand we in jeopardy 
every hour?<BR>[<B>31</B>] I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ 
Jesus our Lord, I die daily.<BR>[<B>32</B>] If after the manner of men I have 
fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let 
us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Be not deceived: evil 
communications corrupt good manners.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Awake to righteousness, and 
sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your 
shame.<BR>[<B>35</B>] But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and 
with what body do they come?<BR>[<B>36</B>] Thou fool, that which thou sowest is 
not quickened, except it die:<BR>[<B>37</B>] And that which thou sowest, thou 
sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or 
of some other grain:<BR>[<B>38</B>] But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased 
him, and to every seed his own body.<BR>[<B>39</B>] All flesh is not the same 
flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another 
of fishes, and another of birds.<BR>[<B>40</B>] There are also celestial bodies, 
and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of 
the terrestrial is another.<BR>[<B>41</B>] There is one glory of the sun, and 
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star 
differeth from another star in glory.<BR>[<B>42</B>] So also is the resurrection 
of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in 
incorruption:<BR>[<B>43</B>] It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it 
is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:<BR>[<B>44</B>] It is sown a natural 
body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a 
spiritual body.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And so it is written, The first man Adam was made 
a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.<BR>[<B>46</B>] 
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and 
afterward that which is spiritual.<BR>[<B>47</B>] The first man is of the earth, 
earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.<BR>[<B>48</B>] As is the earthy, 
such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also 
that are heavenly.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And as we have borne the image of the earthy, 
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<BR>[<B>50</B>] Now this I say, 
brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth 
corruption inherit incorruption.<BR>[<B>51</B>] Behold, I shew you a mystery; We 
shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,<BR>[<B>52</B>] In a moment, in 
the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the 
dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<BR>[<B>53</B>] For 
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on 
immortality.<BR>[<B>54</B>] So when this corruptible shall have put on 
incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be 
brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in 
victory.<BR>[<B>55</B>] O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy 
victory?<BR>[<B>56</B>] The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is 
the law.<BR>[<B>57</B>] But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory 
through our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR>[<B>58</B>] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be 
ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as 
ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>1Cor.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I 
have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Upon 
the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath 
prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And when I 
come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring 
your liberality unto Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And if it be meet that I go also, 
they shall go with me.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass 
through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And it may be 
that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey 
whithersoever I go.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For I will not see you now by the way; but I 
trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But I will 
tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For a great door and effectual 
is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Now if 
Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the 
work of the Lord, as I also do.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Let no man therefore despise him: 
but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him 
with the brethren.<BR>[<B>12</B>] As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly 
desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to 
come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient 
time.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be 
strong.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Let all your things be done with charity.<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the 
firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of 
the saints,)<BR>[<B>16</B>] That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every 
one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.<BR>[<B>17</B>] I am glad of the coming 
of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your 
part they have supplied.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For they have refreshed my spirit and 
yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.<BR>[<B>19</B>] The churches 
of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the 
church that is in their house.<BR>[<B>20</B>] All the brethren greet you. Greet 
ye one another with an holy kiss.<BR>[<B>21</B>] The salutation of me Paul with 
mine own hand.<BR>[<B>22</B>] If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him 
be Anathema Maranatha.<BR>[<B>23</B>] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with 
you.<BR>[<B>24</B>] My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.<BR>
