<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Mark</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of God;<BR>[<B>2</B>] As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my 
messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before 
thee.<BR>[<B>3</B>] The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the 
way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR>[<B>4</B>] John did baptize in the 
wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of 
sins.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they 
of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing 
their sins.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a 
girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild 
honey;<BR>[<B>7</B>] And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I 
after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and 
unloose.<BR>[<B>8</B>] I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall 
baptize you with the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And it came to pass in those 
days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in 
Jordan.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the 
heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I 
am well pleased.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the 
wilderness.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he was there in the wilderness forty days, 
tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto 
him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into 
Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<BR>[<B>15</B>] And saying, 
The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe 
the gospel.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon 
and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were 
fishers.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will 
make you to become fishers of men.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And straightway they forsook 
their nets, and followed him.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when he had gone a little 
further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also 
were in the ship mending their nets.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And straightway he called 
them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, 
and went after him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And they went into Capernaum; and straightway 
on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And 
they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had 
authority, and not as the scribes.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And there was in their 
synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,<BR>[<B>24</B>] Saying, 
Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou 
come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of 
God.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out 
of him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with 
a loud voice, he came out of him.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And they were all amazed, 
insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what 
new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, 
and they do obey him.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And immediately his fame spread abroad 
throughout all the region round about Galilee.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And forthwith, 
when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon 
and Andrew, with James and John.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But Simon's wife's mother lay 
sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he came and 
took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and 
she ministered unto them.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And at even, when the sun did set, they 
brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with 
devils.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And all the city was gathered together at the 
door.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and 
cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew 
him.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he 
went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And 
when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for 
thee.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that 
I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he 
preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out 
devils.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and 
kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me 
clean.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and 
touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And as 
soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was 
cleansed.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him 
away;<BR>[<B>44</B>] And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go 
thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things 
which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<BR>[<B>45</B>] But he went 
out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that 
Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert 
places: and they came to him from every quarter.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] And again he entered into Capernaum, after some days; 
and it was noised that he was in the house.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And straightway many 
were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not 
so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And 
they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of 
four.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, 
they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let 
down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.<BR>[<B>5</B>] When Jesus saw 
their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven 
thee.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and 
reasoning in their hearts,<BR>[<B>7</B>] Why doth this man thus speak 
blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?<BR>[<B>8</B>] And immediately 
when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he 
said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?<BR>[<B>9</B>] Whether 
is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to 
say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?<BR>[<B>10</B>] But that ye may know 
that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick 
of the palsy,)<BR>[<B>11</B>] I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and 
go thy way into thine house.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And immediately he arose, took up 
the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and 
glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he 
went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and 
he taught them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of 
Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he 
arose and followed him.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat 
at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus 
and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.<BR>[<B>16</B>] 
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they 
said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans 
and sinners?<BR>[<B>17</B>] When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that 
are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to 
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the disciples 
of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why 
do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast 
not?<BR>[<B>19</B>] And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the 
bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the 
bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But the days will come, 
when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in 
those days.<BR>[<B>21</B>] No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old 
garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the 
rent is made worse.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: 
else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the 
bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new 
bottles.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And it came to pass, that he went through the corn 
fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the 
ears of corn.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do 
they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?<BR>[<B>25</B>] And he said 
unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an 
hungred, he, and they that were with him?<BR>[<B>26</B>] How he went into the 
house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, 
which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were 
with him?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, 
and not man for the sabbath:<BR>[<B>28</B>] Therefore the Son of man is Lord 
also of the sabbath.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was 
a man there which had a withered hand.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And they watched him, 
whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse 
him.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand 
forth.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the 
sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their 
peace.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when he had looked round about on them with anger, 
being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch 
forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as 
the other.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took 
counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy 
him.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and 
a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre 
and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came 
unto him.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should 
wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng 
him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him 
for to touch him, as many as had plagues.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And unclean spirits, 
when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of 
God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And he straitly charged them that they should not make him 
known.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom 
he would: and they came unto him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And he ordained twelve, that 
they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to 
preach,<BR>[<B>15</B>] And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out 
devils:<BR>[<B>16</B>] And Simon he surnamed Peter;<BR>[<B>17</B>] And James the 
son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, 
which is, The sons of thunder:<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Andrew, and Philip, and 
Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and 
Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,<BR>[<B>19</B>] And Judas Iscariot, which 
also betrayed him: and they went into an house.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And the multitude 
cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat 
bread.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay 
hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the scribes 
which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the 
devils casteth he out devils.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he called them unto him, and 
said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?<BR>[<B>24</B>] And if 
a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot 
stand.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he 
cannot stand, but hath an end.<BR>[<B>27</B>] No man can enter into a strong 
man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and 
then he will spoil his house.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Verily I say unto you, All sins 
shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they 
shall blaspheme:<BR>[<B>29</B>] But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy 
Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal 
damnation:<BR>[<B>30</B>] Because they said, He hath an unclean 
spirit.<BR>[<B>31</B>] There came then his brethren and his mother, and, 
standing without, sent unto him, calling him.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And the multitude 
sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren 
without seek for thee.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he answered them, saying, Who is my 
mother, or my brethren?<BR>[<B>34</B>] And he looked round about on them which 
sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<BR>[<B>35</B>] For 
whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and 
mother.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there 
was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat 
in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his 
doctrine,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to 
sow:<BR>[<B>4</B>] And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, 
and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And some fell on 
stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because 
it had no depth of earth:<BR>[<B>6</B>] But when the sun was up, it was 
scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And some 
fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no 
fruit.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that 
sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and 
some an hundred.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, 
let him hear.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And when he was alone, they that were about him 
with the twelve asked of him the parable.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he said unto them, 
Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them 
that are without, all these things are done in parables:<BR>[<B>12</B>] That 
seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not 
understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be 
forgiven them.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? 
and how then will ye know all parables?<BR>[<B>14</B>] The sower soweth the 
word.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; 
but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word 
that was sown in their hearts.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And these are they likewise which 
are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately 
receive it with gladness;<BR>[<B>17</B>] And have no root in themselves, and so 
endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the 
word's sake, immediately they are offended.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And these are they 
which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the cares 
of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things 
entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive 
it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an 
hundred.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put 
under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a 
candlestick?<BR>[<B>22</B>] For there is nothing hid, which shall not be 
manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come 
abroad.<BR>[<B>23</B>] If any man have ears to hear, let him 
hear.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what 
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more 
be given.<BR>[<B>25</B>] For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that 
hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And he 
said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the 
ground;<BR>[<B>27</B>] And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed 
should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.<BR>[<B>28</B>] For the earth 
bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the 
full corn in the ear.<BR>[<B>29</B>] But when the fruit is brought forth, 
immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is 
come.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? 
or with what comparison shall we compare it?<BR>[<B>31</B>] It is like a grain 
of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds 
that be in the earth:<BR>[<B>32</B>] But when it is sown, it groweth up, and 
becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the 
fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And with many 
such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear 
it.<BR>[<B>34</B>] But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they 
were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And the 
same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the 
other side.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And when they had sent away the multitude, they took 
him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little 
ships.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat 
into the ship, so that it was now full.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he was in the hinder 
part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, 
Master, carest thou not that we perish?<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he arose, and rebuked 
the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there 
was a great calm.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? 
how is it that ye have no faith?<BR>[<B>41</B>] And they feared exceedingly, and 
said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea 
obey him?<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] And they came over unto the other side of the sea, 
into the country of the Gadarenes.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when he was come out of the 
ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean 
spirit,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could 
bind him, no, not with chains:<BR>[<B>4</B>] Because that he had been often 
bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, 
and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, 
and cutting himself with stones.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But when he saw Jesus afar off, 
he ran and worshipped him,<BR>[<B>7</B>] And cried with a loud voice, and said, 
What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee 
by God, that thou torment me not.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For he said unto him, Come out 
of the man, thou unclean spirit.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he asked him, What is thy 
name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are 
many.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he besought him much that he would not send them away 
out of the country.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a 
great herd of swine feeding.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And all the devils besought him, 
saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered 
into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, 
(they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And 
they went out to see what it was that was done.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And they come to 
Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, 
sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were 
afraid.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that 
was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And 
they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And when he 
was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him 
that he might be with him.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but 
saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord 
hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he 
departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for 
him: and all men did marvel.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And when Jesus was passed over again 
by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto 
the sea.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the 
synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his 
feet,<BR>[<B>23</B>] And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth 
at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may 
be healed; and she shall live.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And Jesus went with him; and much 
people followed him, and thronged him.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And a certain woman, which 
had an issue of blood twelve years,<BR>[<B>26</B>] And had suffered many things 
of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, 
but rather grew worse,<BR>[<B>27</B>] When she had heard of Jesus, came in the 
press behind, and touched his garment.<BR>[<B>28</B>] For she said, If I may 
touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And straightway the 
fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed 
of that plague.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that 
virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched 
my clothes?<BR>[<B>31</B>] And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the 
multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?<BR>[<B>32</B>] And he 
looked round about to see her that had done this thing.<BR>[<B>33</B>] But the 
woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down 
before him, and told him all the truth.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And he said unto her, 
Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy 
plague.<BR>[<B>35</B>] While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the 
synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou 
the Master any further?<BR>[<B>36</B>] As soon as Jesus heard the word that was 
spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only 
believe.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and 
James, and John the brother of James.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he cometh to the house 
of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and 
wailed greatly.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why 
make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.<BR>[<B>40</B>] 
And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the 
father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth 
in where the damsel was lying.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And he took the damsel by the 
hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I 
say unto thee, arise.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And straightway the damsel arose, and 
walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a 
great astonishment.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And he charged them straitly that no man 
should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he went out from thence, and came into his own 
country; and his disciples follow him.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when the sabbath day 
was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were 
astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is 
this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his 
hands?<BR>[<B>3</B>] Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of 
James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? 
And they were offended at him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] But Jesus said unto them, A prophet 
is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his 
own house.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid 
his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he marvelled 
because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, 
teaching.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send 
them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean 
spirits;<BR>[<B>8</B>] And commanded them that they should take nothing for 
their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their 
purse:<BR>[<B>9</B>] But be shod with sandals; and not put on two 
coats.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into 
an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And 
whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off 
the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It 
shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for 
that city.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they went out, and preached that men should 
repent.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many 
that were sick, and healed them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And king Herod heard of him; 
(for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen 
from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in 
him.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a 
prophet, or as one of the prophets.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But when Herod heard thereof, 
he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.<BR>[<B>17</B>] 
For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in 
prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married 
her.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to 
have thy brother's wife.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against 
him, and would have killed him; but she could not:<BR>[<B>20</B>] For Herod 
feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and 
when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And 
when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his 
lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;<BR>[<B>22</B>] And when the 
daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them 
that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou 
wilt, and I will give it thee.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he sware unto her, Whatsoever 
thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my 
kingdom.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall 
I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And she came 
in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou 
give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And 
the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which 
sat with him, he would not reject her.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And immediately the king 
sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and 
beheaded him in the prison,<BR>[<B>28</B>] And brought his head in a charger, 
and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.<BR>[<B>29</B>] 
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid 
it in a tomb.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And the apostles gathered themselves together unto 
Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had 
taught.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a 
desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they 
had no leisure so much as to eat.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they departed into a desert 
place by ship privately.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And the people saw them departing, and 
many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and 
came together unto him.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And Jesus, when he came out, saw much 
people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep 
not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This 
is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:<BR>[<B>36</B>] Send them 
away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and 
buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.<BR>[<B>37</B>] He answered 
and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and 
buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?<BR>[<B>38</B>] He 
saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they 
say, Five, and two fishes.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he commanded them to make all sit 
down by companies upon the green grass.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And they sat down in 
ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And when he had taken the 
five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake 
the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two 
fishes divided he among them all.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And they did all eat, and were 
filled.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, 
and of the fishes.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And they that did eat of the loaves were about 
five thousand men.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And straightway he constrained his disciples 
to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while 
he sent away the people.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And when he had sent them away, he 
departed into a mountain to pray.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And when even was come, the 
ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And 
he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about 
the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and 
would have passed by them.<BR>[<B>49</B>] But when they saw him walking upon the 
sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:<BR>[<B>50</B>] For they 
all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith 
unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And he went 
up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in 
themselves beyond measure, and wondered.<BR>[<B>52</B>] For they considered not 
the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And when 
they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the 
shore.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they 
knew him,<BR>[<B>55</B>] And ran through that whole region round about, and 
began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he 
was.<BR>[<B>56</B>] And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or 
country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might 
touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were 
made whole.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain 
of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when they saw some 
of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, 
they found fault.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they 
wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the 
elders.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when they come from the market, except they wash, they 
eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as 
the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Then 
the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the 
tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?<BR>[<B>6</B>] He 
answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as 
it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far 
from me.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctines 
the commandments of men.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For laying aside the commandment of God, 
ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other 
such like things ye do.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And he said unto them, Full well ye reject 
the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For 
Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or 
mother, let him die the death:<BR>[<B>11</B>] But ye say, If a man shall say to 
his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou 
mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And ye suffer him 
no more to do ought for his father or his mother;<BR>[<B>13</B>] Making the word 
of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many 
such like things do ye.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when he had called all the people 
unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and 
understand:<BR>[<B>15</B>] There is nothing from without a man, that entering 
into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they 
that defile the man.<BR>[<B>16</B>] If any man have ears to hear, let him 
hear.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when he was entered into the house from the people, his 
disciples asked him concerning the parable.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And he saith unto 
them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever 
thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;<BR>[<B>19</B>] 
Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into 
the draught, purging all meats?<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he said, That which cometh 
out of the man, that defileth the man.<BR>[<B>21</B>] For from within, out of 
the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, 
murders,<BR>[<B>22</B>] Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, 
lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:<BR>[<B>23</B>] All 
these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And from 
thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into 
an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, 
and came and fell at his feet:<BR>[<B>26</B>] The woman was a Greek, a 
Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil 
out of her daughter.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But Jesus said unto her, Let the children 
first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it 
unto the dogs.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet 
the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he 
said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy 
daughter.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And when she was come to her house, she found the devil 
gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And again, 
departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, 
through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they bring unto 
him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him 
to put his hand upon him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he took him aside from the 
multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his 
tongue;<BR>[<B>34</B>] And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, 
Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And straightway his ears were 
opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake 
plain.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the 
more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published 
it;<BR>[<B>37</B>] And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all 
things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] In those days the multitude being very great, and 
having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto 
them,<BR>[<B>2</B>] I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now 
been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:<BR>[<B>3</B>] And if I send 
them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of 
them came from far.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And his disciples answered him, From whence 
can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And 
he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, 
and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and 
they did set them before the people.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they had a few small 
fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before 
them.<BR>[<B>8</B>] So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the 
broken meat that was left seven baskets.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they that had eaten 
were about four thousand: and he sent them away.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And straightway 
he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of 
Dalmanutha.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question 
with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And he 
sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a 
sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this 
generation.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he left them, and entering into the ship again 
departed to the other side.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Now the disciples had forgotten to 
take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one 
loaf.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the 
leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And they 
reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no 
bread.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, 
because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your 
heart yet hardened?<BR>[<B>18</B>] Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, 
hear ye not? and do ye not remember?<BR>[<B>19</B>] When I brake the five loaves 
among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say 
unto him, Twelve.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And when the seven among four thousand, how 
many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?<BR>[<B>22</B>] And 
he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to 
touch him.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out 
of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he 
asked him if he saw ought.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And he looked up, and said, I see men 
as trees, walking.<BR>[<B>25</B>] After that he put his hands again upon his 
eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man 
clearly.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go 
into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And Jesus went 
out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he 
asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?<BR>[<B>28</B>] 
And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the 
prophets.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And 
Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And he 
charged them that they should tell no man of him.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he began to 
teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the 
elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three 
days rise again.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took 
him, and began to rebuke him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] But when he had turned about and 
looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: 
for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of 
men.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And when he had called the people unto him with his 
disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny 
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<BR>[<B>35</B>] For whosoever will 
save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and 
the gospel's, the same shall save it.<BR>[<B>36</B>] For what shall it profit a 
man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<BR>[<B>37</B>] Or 
what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<BR>[<B>38</B>] Whosoever 
therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful 
generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the 
glory of his Father with the holy angels.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That 
there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they 
have seen the kingdom of God come with power.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And after six days 
Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an 
high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before 
them.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so 
as no fuller on earth can white them.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And there appeared unto them 
Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And Peter 
answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us 
make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for 
Elias.<BR>[<B>6</B>] For he wist not what to say; for they were sore 
afraid.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice 
came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.<BR>[<B>8</B>] 
And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save 
Jesus only with themselves.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And as they came down from the 
mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had 
seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And they kept 
that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from 
the dead should mean.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And they asked him, saying, Why say the 
scribes that Elias must first come?<BR>[<B>12</B>] And he answered and told 
them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written 
of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at 
nought.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they 
have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of 
him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude 
about them, and the scribes questioning with them.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and 
running to him saluted him.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he asked the scribes, What 
question ye with them?<BR>[<B>17</B>] And one of the multitude answered and 
said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb 
spirit;<BR>[<B>18</B>] And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he 
foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy 
disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.<BR>[<B>19</B>] He 
answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? 
how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And they brought 
him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell 
on the ground, and wallowed foaming.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he asked his father, How 
long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy 
him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help 
us.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are 
possible to him that believeth.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And straightway the father of the 
child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine 
unbelief.<BR>[<B>25</B>] When Jesus saw that the people came running together, 
he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge 
thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And the spirit 
cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch 
that many said, He is dead.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But Jesus took him by the hand, and 
lifted him up; and he arose.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And when he was come into the house, 
his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?<BR>[<B>29</B>] 
And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and 
fasting.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; 
and he would not that any man should know it.<BR>[<B>31</B>] For he taught his 
disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of 
men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the 
third day.<BR>[<B>32</B>] But they understood not that saying, and were afraid 
to ask him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he 
asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the 
way?<BR>[<B>34</B>] But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed 
among themselves, who should be the greatest.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And he sat down, 
and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the 
same shall be last of all, and servant of all.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And he took a 
child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, 
he said unto them,<BR>[<B>37</B>] Whosoever shall receive one of such children 
in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but 
him that sent me.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw 
one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, 
because he followeth not us.<BR>[<B>39</B>] But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for 
there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil 
of me.<BR>[<B>40</B>] For he that is not against us is on our 
part.<BR>[<B>41</B>] For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my 
name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his 
reward.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that 
believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, 
and he were cast into the sea.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And if thy hand offend thee, cut 
it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands 
to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:<BR>[<B>44</B>] 
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And if 
thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, 
than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be 
quenched:<BR>[<B>46</B>] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not 
quenched.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is 
better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two 
eyes to be cast into hell fire:<BR>[<B>48</B>] Where their worm dieth not, and 
the fire is not quenched.<BR>[<B>49</B>] For every one shall be salted with 
fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.<BR>[<B>50</B>] Salt is 
good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have 
salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.<BR>

<H3>Mark.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts 
of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; 
and, as he was wont, he taught them again.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And the Pharisees came 
to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting 
him.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command 
you?<BR>[<B>4</B>] And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, 
and to put her away.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And Jesus answered and said unto them, For 
the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But from the 
beginning of the creation God made them male and female.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For this 
cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his 
wife;<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more 
twain, but one flesh.<BR>[<B>9</B>] What therefore God hath joined together, let 
not man put asunder.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And in the house his disciples asked him 
again of the same matter.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall 
put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against 
her.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to 
another, she committeth adultery.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And they brought young children 
to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought 
them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said 
unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for 
of such is the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever 
shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter 
therein.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon 
them, and blessed them.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when he was gone forth into the way, 
there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what 
shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Jesus said unto 
him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, 
God.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do 
not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy 
father and mother.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he answered and said unto him, Master, all 
these have I observed from my youth.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Then Jesus beholding him 
loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell 
whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in 
heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he was 
sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great 
possessions.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his 
disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of 
God!<BR>[<B>24</B>] And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus 
answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that 
trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!<BR>[<B>25</B>] It is easier 
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into 
the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And they were astonished out of measure, 
saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And Jesus looking 
upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all 
things are possible.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we 
have left all, and have followed thee.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And Jesus answered and 
said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, 
or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, 
and the gospel's,<BR>[<B>30</B>] But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this 
time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, 
with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.<BR>[<B>31</B>] But 
many that are first shall be last; and the last first.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they 
were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were 
amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, 
and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,<BR>[<B>33</B>] 
Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered 
unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to 
death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:<BR>[<B>34</B>] And they shall mock 
him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the 
third day he shall rise again.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And James and John, the sons of 
Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us 
whatsoever we shall desire.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And he said unto them, What would ye 
that I should do for you?<BR>[<B>37</B>] They said unto him, Grant unto us that 
we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy 
glory.<BR>[<B>38</B>] But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye 
drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am 
baptized with?<BR>[<B>39</B>] And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said 
unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the 
baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:<BR>[<B>40</B>] But to 
sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be 
given to them for whom it is prepared.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And when the ten heard it, 
they began to be much displeased with James and John.<BR>[<B>42</B>] But Jesus 
called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted 
to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones 
exercise authority upon them.<BR>[<B>43</B>] But so shall it not be among you: 
but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:<BR>[<B>44</B>] 
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of 
all.<BR>[<B>45</B>] For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but 
to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And they 
came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great 
number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side 
begging.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he 
began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on 
me.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he 
cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.<BR>[<B>49</B>] 
And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind 
man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.<BR>[<B>50</B>] 
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And 
Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The 
blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.<BR>[<B>52</B>] And 
Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately 
he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage 
and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his 
disciples,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over 
against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, 
whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And if any man 
say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and 
straightway he will send him hither.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And they went their way, and 
found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they 
loose him.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And certain of them that stood there said unto them, 
What do ye, loosing the colt?<BR>[<B>6</B>] And they said unto them even as 
Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they brought the 
colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon 
him.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut 
down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And they 
that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he 
that cometh in the name of the Lord:<BR>[<B>10</B>] Blessed be the kingdom of 
our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the 
highest.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: 
and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was 
come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And on the 
morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any 
thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time 
of figs was not yet.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man 
eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast 
out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the 
moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;<BR>[<B>16</B>] And would 
not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the 
temple.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My 
house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a 
den of thieves.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and 
sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people 
was astonished at his doctrine.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when even was come, he went 
out of the city.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw 
the fig tree dried up from the roots.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And Peter calling to 
remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is 
withered away.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in 
God.<BR>[<B>23</B>] For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto 
this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not 
doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall 
come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Therefore I say 
unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive 
them, and ye shall have them.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And when ye stand praying, forgive, 
if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may 
forgive you your trespasses.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But if ye do not forgive, neither 
will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And 
they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to 
him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,<BR>[<B>28</B>] And say 
unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this 
authority to do these things?<BR>[<B>29</B>] And Jesus answered and said unto 
them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by 
what authority I do these things.<BR>[<B>30</B>] The baptism of John, was it 
from heaven, or of men? answer me.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And they reasoned with 
themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye 
not believe him?<BR>[<B>32</B>] But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the 
people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.<BR>[<B>33</B>] 
And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith 
unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he began to speak unto them by parables. A 
certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place 
for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into 
a far country.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a 
servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the 
vineyard.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away 
empty.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him 
they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully 
handled.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many 
others; beating some, and killing some.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Having yet therefore one 
son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will 
reverence my son.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But those husbandmen said among themselves, This 
is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be 
ours.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the 
vineyard.<BR>[<B>9</B>] What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he 
will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto 
others.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the 
builders rejected is become the head of the corner:<BR>[<B>11</B>] This was the 
Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?<BR>[<B>12</B>] And they sought 
to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the 
parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him 
in his words.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, 
we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the 
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give 
tribute to Caesar, or not?<BR>[<B>15</B>] Shall we give, or shall we not give? 
But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a 
penny, that I may see it.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And they brought it. And he saith unto 
them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, 
Caesar's.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar 
the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they 
marvelled at him.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say 
there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,<BR>[<B>19</B>] Master, 
Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and 
leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto 
his brother.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a 
wife, and dying left no seed.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the second took her, and died, 
neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And the seven 
had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.<BR>[<B>23</B>] In 
the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of 
them? for the seven had her to wife.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And Jesus answering said 
unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither 
the power of God?<BR>[<B>25</B>] For when they shall rise from the dead, they 
neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in 
heaven.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not 
read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the 
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?<BR>[<B>27</B>] He is 
not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly 
err.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning 
together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the 
first commandment of all?<BR>[<B>29</B>] And Jesus answered him, The first of 
all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one 
Lord:<BR>[<B>30</B>] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is 
the first commandment.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And the second is like, namely this, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater 
than these.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast 
said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but 
he:<BR>[<B>33</B>] And to love him with all the heart, and with all the 
understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his 
neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and 
sacrifices.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he 
said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that 
durst ask him any question.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And Jesus answered and said, while he 
taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of 
David?<BR>[<B>36</B>] For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to 
my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy 
footstool.<BR>[<B>37</B>] David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence 
is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And 
he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in 
long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,<BR>[<B>39</B>] And the 
chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:<BR>[<B>40</B>] 
Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall 
receive greater damnation.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And Jesus sat over against the 
treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that 
were rich cast in much.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And there came a certain poor widow, and 
she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And he called unto 
him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor 
widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the 
treasury:<BR>[<B>44</B>] For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of 
her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] And as he went out of the temple, one of his 
disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings 
are here!<BR>[<B>2</B>] And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these 
great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not 
be thrown down.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over 
against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him 
privately,<BR>[<B>4</B>] Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be 
the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?<BR>[<B>5</B>] And Jesus 
answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:<BR>[<B>6</B>] 
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive 
many.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye 
not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be 
yet.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against 
kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be 
famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But 
take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the 
synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings 
for my sake, for a testimony against them.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the gospel must 
first be published among all nations.<BR>[<B>11</B>] But when they shall lead 
you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither 
do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak 
ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now the 
brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children 
shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to 
death.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but 
he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But 
when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the 
prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then 
let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:<BR>[<B>15</B>] And let him 
that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to 
take any thing out of his house:<BR>[<B>16</B>] And let him that is in the field 
not turn back again for to take up his garment.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But woe to them 
that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For in those 
days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation 
which God created unto this time, neither shall be.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And except 
that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the 
elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; 
believe him not:<BR>[<B>22</B>] For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, 
and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the 
elect.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all 
things.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall 
be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,<BR>[<B>25</B>] And the stars 
of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be 
shaken.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the 
clouds with great power and glory.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And then shall he send his 
angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the 
uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Now 
learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth 
forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:<BR>[<B>29</B>] So ye in like manner, 
when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the 
doors.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not 
pass, till all these things be done.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Heaven and earth shall pass 
away: but my words shall not pass away.<BR>[<B>32</B>] But of that day and that 
hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, 
but the Father.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not 
when the time is.<BR>[<B>34</B>] For the Son of man is as a man taking a far 
journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every 
man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Watch ye 
therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at 
midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:<BR>[<B>36</B>] Lest coming 
suddenly he find you sleeping.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And what I say unto you I say unto 
all, Watch.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] After two days was the feast of the passover, and of 
unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might 
take him by craft, and put him to death.<BR>[<B>2</B>] But they said, Not on the 
feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And being in 
Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman 
having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake 
the box, and poured it on his head.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And there were some that had 
indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment 
made?<BR>[<B>5</B>] For it might have been sold for more than three hundred 
pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against 
her.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath 
wrought a good work on me.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For ye have the poor with you always, 
and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not 
always.<BR>[<B>8</B>] She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to 
anoint my body to the burying.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever 
this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she 
hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And Judas 
Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto 
them.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to 
give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray 
him.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the 
passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare 
that thou mayest eat the passover?<BR>[<B>13</B>] And he sendeth forth two of 
his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet 
you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And wheresoever 
he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is 
the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my 
disciples?<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and 
prepared: there make ready for us.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And his disciples went forth, 
and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready 
the passover.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And in the evening he cometh with the 
twelve.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say 
unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And 
they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another 
said, Is it I?<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he answered and said unto them, It is one of 
the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.<BR>[<B>21</B>] The Son of man 
indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of 
man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been 
born.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and 
brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<BR>[<B>23</B>] 
And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they 
all drank of it.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And he said unto them, This is my blood of the 
new testament, which is shed for many.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Verily I say unto you, I 
will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new 
in the kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And when they had sung an hymn, they went 
out into the mount of Olives.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And Jesus saith unto them, All ye 
shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the 
shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But after that I am 
risen, I will go before you into Galilee.<BR>[<B>29</B>] But Peter said unto 
him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And Jesus 
saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, 
before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>[<B>31</B>] But he 
spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in 
any wise. Likewise also said they all.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And they came to a place 
which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I 
shall pray.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and 
began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;<BR>[<B>34</B>] And saith unto 
them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and 
watch.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and 
prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup 
from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And he 
cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? 
couldest not thou watch one hour?<BR>[<B>38</B>] Watch ye and pray, lest ye 
enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is 
weak.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same 
words.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for 
their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And 
he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: 
it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the 
hands of sinners.<BR>[<B>42</B>] Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is 
at hand.<BR>[<B>43</B>] And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one 
of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the 
chief priests and the scribes and the elders.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And he that 
betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same 
is he; take him, and lead him away safely.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And as soon as he was 
come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed 
him.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And they laid their hands on him, and took 
him.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a 
servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And Jesus 
answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords 
and with staves to take me?<BR>[<B>49</B>] I was daily with you in the temple 
teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be 
fulfilled.<BR>[<B>50</B>] And they all forsook him, and fled.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And 
there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his 
naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:<BR>[<B>52</B>] And he left the 
linen cloth, and fled from them naked.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And they led Jesus away to 
the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the 
elders and the scribes.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And Peter followed him afar off, even 
into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed 
himself at the fire.<BR>[<B>55</B>] And the chief priests and all the council 
sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found 
none.<BR>[<B>56</B>] For many bare false witness against him, but their witness 
agreed not together.<BR>[<B>57</B>] And there arose certain, and bare false 
witness against him, saying,<BR>[<B>58</B>] We heard him say, I will destroy 
this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another 
made without hands.<BR>[<B>59</B>] But neither so did their witness agree 
together.<BR>[<B>60</B>] And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked 
Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against 
thee?<BR>[<B>61</B>] But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high 
priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the 
Blessed?<BR>[<B>62</B>] And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man 
sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of 
heaven.<BR>[<B>63</B>] Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What 
need we any further witnesses?<BR>[<B>64</B>] Ye have heard the blasphemy: what 
think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.<BR>[<B>65</B>] And 
some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say 
unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their 
hands.<BR>[<B>66</B>] And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one 
of the maids of the high priest:<BR>[<B>67</B>] And when she saw Peter warming 
himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of 
Nazareth.<BR>[<B>68</B>] But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I 
what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock 
crew.<BR>[<B>69</B>] And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that 
stood by, This is one of them.<BR>[<B>70</B>] And he denied it again. And a 
little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of 
them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.<BR>[<B>71</B>] 
But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye 
speak.<BR>[<B>72</B>] And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to 
mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt 
deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] And straightway in the morning the chief priests held 
a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound 
Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And 
Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, 
Thou sayest it.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And the chief priests accused him of many things: 
but he answered nothing.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And Pilate asked him again, saying, 
Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against 
thee.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate 
marvelled.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, 
whomsoever they desired.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And there was one named Barabbas, which 
lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed 
murder in the insurrection.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the multitude crying aloud began 
to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But Pilate 
answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the 
Jews?<BR>[<B>10</B>] For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for 
envy.<BR>[<B>11</B>] But the chief priests moved the people, that he should 
rather release Barabbas unto them.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And Pilate answered and said 
again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the 
King of the Jews?<BR>[<B>13</B>] And they cried out again, Crucify 
him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And 
they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And so Pilate, 
willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, 
when he had scourged him, to be crucified.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And the soldiers led 
him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole 
band.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of 
thorns, and put it about his head,<BR>[<B>18</B>] And began to salute him, Hail, 
King of the Jews!<BR>[<B>19</B>] And they smote him on the head with a reed, and 
did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own 
clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And they compel 
one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of 
Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And they bring him unto 
the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a 
skull.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he 
received it not.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when they had crucified him, they parted his 
garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And 
it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And the 
superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE 
JEWS.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right 
hand, and the other on his left.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And the scripture was fulfilled, 
which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And they 
that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that 
destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,<BR>[<B>30</B>] Save 
thyself, and come down from the cross.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Likewise also the chief 
priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself 
he cannot save.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from 
the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him 
reviled him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness 
over the whole land until the ninth hour.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And at the ninth hour 
Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, 
being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<BR>[<B>35</B>] And 
some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth 
Elias.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put 
it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias 
will come to take him down.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
and gave up the ghost.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And the veil of the temple was rent in 
twain from the top to the bottom.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And when the centurion, which 
stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he 
said, Truly this man was the Son of God.<BR>[<B>40</B>] There were also women 
looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James 
the less and of Joses, and Salome;<BR>[<B>41</B>] (Who also, when he was in 
Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came 
up with him unto Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And now when the even was come, 
because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the 
sabbath,<BR>[<B>43</B>] Joseph of Arimathaea, and honourable counseller, which 
also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and 
craved the body of Jesus.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And Pilate marvelled if he were already 
dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any 
while dead.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the 
body to Joseph.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and 
wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a 
rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And Mary 
Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Mark.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and 
Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might 
come and anoint him.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And very early in the morning the first day 
of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the 
sun.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the 
stone from the door of the sepulchre?<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when they looked, they 
saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, 
clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And he 
saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was 
crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid 
him.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth 
before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto 
you.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for 
they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they 
were afraid.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the 
week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven 
devils.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And she went and told them that had been with him, as 
they mourned and wept.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And they, when they had heard that he was 
alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.<BR>[<B>12</B>] After that he 
appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the 
country.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And they went and told it unto the residue: neither 
believed they them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they 
sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, 
because they believed not them which had seen him after he was 
risen.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and 
preach the gospel to every creature.<BR>[<B>16</B>] He that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be 
damned.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my 
name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new 
tongues;<BR>[<B>18</B>] They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any 
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they 
shall recover.<BR>[<B>19</B>] So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he 
was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and 
confirming the word with signs following. Amen.<BR>
