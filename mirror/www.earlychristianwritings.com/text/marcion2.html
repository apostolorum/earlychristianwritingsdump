8:1 	And it came to pass afterward, <br> 
	that he made his way through every city and village, <br> 
	preaching and announcing as glad tidings the kingdom of God: <br> 
	and the twelve were with him. <br> 
2  	And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, <br> 
	Mary called Magdalene, from whom went seven demons had gone out, <br>

<p>  
4  	And when a great multitude were coming together, <br> 
	and they of every city were come to him, <br> 
	he spake by a parable: <br> 
5  	A sower went out to sow his seed: <br> 
	and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; <br> 
	and it was trodden down, <br> 
	and the fowls of the heaven devoured it. <br> 
6  	And other fell upon the rock; <br> 
	and when sprung up, it withered away, <br> 
	because it lacked moisture. <br> 
7  	And other fell in the midst of the thorns; <br> 
	and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. <br> 
8  	And other fell on the good ground, <br> 
	and when sprung up, it produced fruit an hundredfold. <br> 
	And when he said these things, he cried, <br> 
	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <br>

  9 And his disciples asked him, saying, <br> 
	What might this parable be? <br> 
10  	And he said, <br> 
	Unto you it is given to know <br> 
	the mysteries of the kingdom of God: <br> 
	but to the rest in parables; <br> 
	that seeing they may not see, <br> 
	and hearing they may not understand. <br>

26  	And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, <br> 
	which is over against Galilee. <br> 
27  	And when he went forth to land, <br> 
	there met him out of the city a certain man, <br> 
	which had demons [a] long time, and wore no cloke, <br> 
	neither abode in a house, <br> 
	but among the tombs. <br> 
28  	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, <br> 
	and with a loud voice said, <br> 
	What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? <br> 
	I beseech thee, torment me not. <br> 
29  	(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. <br> 
	For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept guarded and bound <br> 
	with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands asunder, <br> 
	and was driven of the demon into the deserts). <br> 
30  	And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? <br> 
	And he said, Legion: because many demons were entered into him. <br> 
31  	And they besought him that he would not command them <br> 
	to go out into the abyss. <br> 
32  	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: <br>  
	and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. <br> 
	And he allowed them. <br> 
33  	Then went the demons out of the man, and entered into the swine: <br> 
	and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake, <br> 
	and were choked. <br> 
34  	When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, <br> 
	and went and told it in the city and in the country. <br> 
35  	Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, <br> 
	and found the man, out of whom the demons were departed, <br> 
	sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: <br> 
	and they were afraid. <br> 
36  	They also which saw it told them by what means <br> 
	he that was possessed of the demons was saved. <br> 
37  	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about <br> 
	asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: <br> 
	and he entered into the ship, and returned back again. <br> 
38  	Now the man, from whom the demons were departed, <br> 
	besought him  that he might be with him: <br> 
	but Jesus sent him away, saying, <br> 
39  	Return to thine own house, <br> 
	and recount how great things God hath done unto thee. <br> 
	And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city <br> 
	how great things Jesus had done unto him. <br>

41  	And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, <br> 
	and he was a ruler of the synagogue: <br>

43  	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, <br> 
	which had spent all her living upon physicians, <br> 
	neither could be healed of any, <br> 
44  	Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: <br> 
	and immediately her issue of blood stanched. <br> 
45  	And Jesus said, Who touched me? <br> 
	When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, <br> 
	Teacher, the multitude throng thee and press thee, <br> 
	and sayest thou, Who touched me? <br> 
46  	And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: <br> 
	for I perceived that power had gone out of me. <br> 
47  	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, <br> 
	she came trembling, <br> 
	and falling down before him, <br> 
	she declared unto him before all the people <br> 
	for what reason she had touched him, <br>

<p> 
Zahn omits: 
<p> 
[49  	While he yet spake, <br> 
	there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, <br> 
	saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher. <br> 
50  	But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, <br> 
	Fear not: believe only,  and she shall be saved. <br> 
51  	And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, <br> 
	save Peter, and James, and John, <br> 
	and the father and the mother of the maiden. <br> 
52  	And all were weeping, and bewailed her: but he said, <br> 
	Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. <br> 
53  	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. <br> 
54  	And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, <br> 
	Maid, arise. <br> 
55  	And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: <br> 
	and he commanded  something be given  her to eat. <br>

9: 1 	Then he called his twelve disciples together, <br> 
	and gave them power and authority over all the demons, <br> 
	and to cure diseases. <br> 
2  	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <br> 
3  	And he said unto them, <br>

11  	And the multitudes perceived it, and followed him: and he received them, <br>

 21 And he straightly reprimanded them, <br> 
	and commanded them to tell none such a thing; <br> 
22  	Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, <br>

 28  	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, <br> 
	he took Peter and John and James, <br> 
	and went up into a mountain to pray. <br> 
29  	And [it came to past] as he prayed, <br> 
	the appearance of his countenance was different, <br> 
	and his raiment white,  flashing like lightning. <br> 
30  	And, behold, there stood with him two men, which were Moses and Elias, <br> 
31	seen in his glory. <br><A HREF="../web/20091022221559/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Epip3.html">Panarion 42</A><br><p> 
32  	Now Peter and they that were with him were weighed down with sleep: <br> 
	but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, <br> 
	and the two men that stood with him. <br> 
33 	 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, <br> 
	Teacher, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; <br> 
	one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: <br>

34  	But while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: <br>

37 	And it came to pass, that on the next day, <br> 
	when they were come down from the mountain, <br> 
	a great multitude met him. <br> 
38  	And, behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, <br> 
	Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is my only begotten. <br> 
39  	And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; <br> 
	and it convulseth him with foam, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. <br> 
40  	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. <br> 
41  	And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, <br> 
	how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. <br>

42  	And as he was yet a coming, the demon rent him, and convulsed him. <br> 
	And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, <br> 
	and delivered him again to his father. <br> 
43 	And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. <br> 
	And as they all wondered at all things which Jesus did, <br> 
	he said unto his disciples, <br> 
44  	Take ye into your ears these sayings: <br> 
	for the Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. <br>;<A HREF="../web/20091022221559/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Epip4.html">Panarion 42</A><br><p>

 46  	Then there arose a reasoning among them, <br>

47  	And Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, <br> 
	took a child, and set it [next to] himself, and said unto them, <br>

51	 And it came to pass, when the days of his taking up were being fulfilled, <br> 
	he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, <br> 
52  	And sent messengers before his face: and they went, <br> 
	and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to make ready for him. <br> 
53  	And they did not receive him, because his face was going to Jerusalem. <br> 
54  	And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, <br> 
	Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, <br> 
	and to consume them, even as Elijah did? <br> 
55  	But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, <br> 
	Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. <br> 
56  	For the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. <br> 
	And they went to another village. <br> 
<p>  
57 	And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, <br> 
	a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. <br>

	Foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have lodging places; <br> 
	but the Son of man hath not where he may lay his head. <br> 
59  	And he said unto another, Follow me. <br>

60  	Jesus said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead: <br> 
	but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. <br>
