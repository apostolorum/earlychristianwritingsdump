Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, 
with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.

be killed even as they were, should complete their course. 
<P><A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all

burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the 
pit. <A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then out of the smoke came forth locusts 
on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have 
power. <A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were told that they should not hurt 
the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only 
those people who don't have God's seal on their foreheads. <A name=C9V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were given 
power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was 
like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person. <A name=C9V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In those days people 
will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death 
will flee from them. <A name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The shapes of the locusts were like 
horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and 
their faces were like people's faces. <A name=C9V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They had hair like women's hair, and 
their teeth were like those of lions. <A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They had breastplates, like breastplates 
of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many 
horses rushing to war. <A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They have tails like those of 
scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five 
months. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They have over them as king the angel 
of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Rev.htm#N19">"Abaddon,"</A> but in Greek, 
he has the name <A

are still two woes coming after this. 
<P><A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a 
voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God, <A 
name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying to the sixth angel who had one 
trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!" 
<P><A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The four angels were freed who had been 
prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one 
third of mankind. <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

horsemen was <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Rev.htm#N21">two hundred 
million</A>. I heard the number of them. <A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, 
and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and 
sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, 
and sulfur. <A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By these three plagues were one third 
of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out 
of their mouths. <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the power of the horses is in their 
mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, 
and with them they harm. <A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The rest of mankind, who were not 
killed with these plagues, didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they 
wouldn't worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and 
of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk. <A 
name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They didn't repent of their murders, 
nor of their <A

sexual immorality, nor of their thefts. 
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I saw a mighty angel coming down out of 
the sky, clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the 
sun, and his feet like pillars of fire. <A name=C10V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land. <A name=C10V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He cried with a 
loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their 
voices. <A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the seven thunders sounded, I was 
about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, "Seal up the things 
which the seven thunders said, and don't write them." 
<P><A name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel who I saw standing on the sea 
and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky, <A name=C10V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and swore by him 
who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, 
the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in 
it, that there will no longer be delay, <A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but in the days of the voice of the 
seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, 
as he declared to his servants, the prophets. <A name=C10V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The voice which I 
heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, "Go, take the book which is 
open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land." 
<P><A name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I went to the angel, telling him to 
give me the little book. 
<P>He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up. It will make your stomach bitter, but 
in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey." 
<P><A name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I took the little book out of the 
angel's hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had 
eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. <A name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They told me, "You must prophesy again 
over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings." 
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A reed like a rod was given to me. 
Someone said, "Rise, and measure God's temple, and the altar, and those who 
worship in it. <A name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Leave out the court which is outside of 
the temple, and don't measure it, for it has been given to the gentiles. They 
will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months. <A name=C11V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will give power 
to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, 
clothed in sackcloth." <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These are the two olive trees and the 
two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth. <A name=C11V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If anyone desires 
to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If 
anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way. <A name=C11V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These have the 
power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their 
prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to 
strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. <A name=C11V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they have 
finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war 
with them, and overcome them, and kill them. <A name=C11V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Their dead bodies 
will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and 
Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. <A name=C11V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>From among the 
peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies 
for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a 
tomb. <A name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Those who dwell on the earth rejoice 
over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because 
these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth. <A name=C11V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After the three 
and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood 
on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them. <A name=C11V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I heard a loud 
voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!" They went up into heaven in 
the cloud, and their enemies saw them. <A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In that day there was a great 
earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in 
the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of 
heaven. <A name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The second woe is past. Behold, the 
third woe comes quickly. 
<P><A name=C11V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The seventh angel sounded, and great 
voices in heaven followed, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the 
Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!" 
<P><A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The twenty-four elders, who sit on 
their thrones before God's throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God, <A 
name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying: "We give you thanks, Lord God, 
the Almighty, the one who is and who was<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

because you have taken your great power, and reigned. <A name=C11V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The nations were 
angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to 
give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and 
those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who 
destroy the earth." 
<P><A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God's temple that is in heaven was 
opened, and the ark of the Lord's covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, 
sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed. 
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A great sign was seen in heaven: a 
woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown 
of twelve stars. <A name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She was with child. She cried out in 
pain, laboring to give birth. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Another sign was seen in heaven. 
Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads 
seven crowns. <A name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His tail drew one third of the stars of 
the sky, and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was 
about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child. <A 
name=C12V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She gave birth to a son, a male child, 
who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to 
God, and to his throne. <A name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman fled into the wilderness, 
where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one 
thousand two hundred sixty days. 
<P><A name=C12V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was war in the sky. Michael and 
his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war. <A 
name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They didn't prevail, neither was a 
place found for him any more in heaven. <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The great dragon was thrown down, the 
old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole 
world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with 
him. <A name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I heard a loud voice in heaven, 
saying, "Now is come the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and 
the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown 
down, who accuses them before our God day and night. <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They overcame him 
because of the Lamb's blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They 
didn't love their life, even to death. <A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you 
who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone 
down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time." 
<P><A name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the dragon saw that he was thrown 
down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child. <A 
name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Two wings of the great eagle were 
given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that 
she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of 
the serpent. <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The serpent spewed water out of his 
mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away 
by the stream. <A name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The earth helped the woman, and the 
earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of 
his mouth. <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The dragon grew angry with the woman, 
and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep God's commandments 
and hold Jesus' testimony. 
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I 
saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his 
horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names. <A name=C13V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The beast which I 
saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth 
like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great 
authority. <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of his heads looked like it had 
been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled 
at the beast. <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They worshiped the dragon, because he 
gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is 
like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?" <A name=C13V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A mouth speaking 
great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to make war for forty-two 
months was given to him. <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He opened his mouth for blasphemy 
against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven. 
<A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It was given to him to make war with 
the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, 
and nation was given to him. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All who dwell on the earth will worship 
him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world 
in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed. <A name=C13V9><FONT

<P><A name=C13V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon. <A 
name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He exercises all the authority of the 
first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to 
worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. <A name=C13V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He performs great 
signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of 
people. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He deceives my own people who dwell on 
the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; 
saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the 
beast who had the sword wound and lived. <A name=C13V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It was given to 
him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast 
should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast 
to be killed. <A name=C13V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He causes all, the small and the

their right hands, or on their foreheads; <A name=C13V17><FONT

would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast 
or the number of his name. <A name=C13V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number 
of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six. 
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of

their harps. <A name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the earth. <A name=C14V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his

angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. <A name=C14V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The smoke of their 
torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who 
worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. <A

those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." 
<P><A name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

"Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" 
<P>"Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors; for their 
works follow with them." 
<P><A name=C14V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden 
crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. <A name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

ripe!" <A name=C14V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle. <A name=C14V18><FONT

out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice 
to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle, and 
gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's grapes are fully 
ripe!" <A name=C14V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel thrust his sickle into the 
earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great 
winepress of the wrath of God. <A name=C14V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the

thousand six hundred stadia.</A> 
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath 
is finished. <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I saw something like a sea of glass 
mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image,<FONT

the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. <A

servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;"Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the

ways, you King of the nations. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;For you only are holy.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all 
the nations will come and worship before 
you.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your righteous acts have been 
revealed." 
<P><A name=C15V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. <A

plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes 
around their breasts. 
<P><A name=C15V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of the four living creatures gave 
to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives 
forever and ever. <A name=C15V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the glory of God, and from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, 
until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished. 
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I heard a loud voice out of the temple, 
saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God 
on the earth!" 
<P><A name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The first went, and poured out his bowl 
into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the 
mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image. 
<P><A name=C16V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The second angel poured out his bowl 
into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the 
sea died. 
<P><A name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. <A name=C16V5><FONT

of the waters saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, 
because you have judged these things. <A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they poured out the blood of the 
saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve 
this." <A name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments." 
<P><A name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The fourth poured out his bowl on the 
sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire. <A name=C16V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>People were 
scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the 
power over these plagues. They didn't repent and give him glory. 
<P><A name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The fifth poured out his bowl on the 
throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues 
because of the pain, <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they blasphemed the God of heaven 
because of their pains and their sores. They didn't repent of their works. 
<P><A name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sixth poured out his bowl on the 
great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made 
ready for the kings that come from the sunrise. <A name=C16V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I saw coming out 
of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the 
mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs; <A 
name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they are spirits of demons, 
performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to 
gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty. 
<P><A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

together into the place which is called in Hebrew, Megiddo. 
<P><A name=C16V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The seventh poured out his bowl into 
the air. A loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, 
saying, "It is done!" <A name=C16V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There were lightnings, sounds, and 
thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men 
on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. <A name=C16V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The great city was 
divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great 
was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the 
fierceness of his wrath. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every island fled away, and the 
mountains were not found. <A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Great hailstones, about the weight of 
a <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Rev.htm#N28">talent,</A> came down 
out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the 
hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe. 
<P><A name=C17V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One of the seven angels who had the 
seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the 
judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters, <A name=C17V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>with whom the kings 
of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were 
made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality." <A name=C17V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He carried me away 
in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored 
animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns. <A 
name=C17V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman was dressed in purple and 
scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand 
a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of 
the earth. <A name=C17V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on her forehead a name was written, 
"MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE 
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." <A name=C17V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I saw the woman drunken with the blood 
of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I 
wondered with great amazement. <A name=C17V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel said to me, "Why do you 
wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries 
her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. <A name=C17V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The beast that you 
saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into 
destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written 
in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see 
that the beast was, and is not, and <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Rev.htm#N29">shall be present.</A> <A 
name=C17V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Here is the mind that has wisdom. The 
seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits. <A name=C17V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They are seven 
kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come. When he comes, 
he must continue a little while. <A name=C17V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The beast that was, and is not, is 
himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction. <A 
name=C17V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The ten horns that you saw are ten 
kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, 
with the beast, for one hour. <A name=C17V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These have one mind, and they give 
their power and authority to the beast. <A name=C17V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These will war against the Lamb, and 
the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They 
also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful." <A 
name=C17V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to me, "The waters which you 
saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. 
<A name=C17V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The ten horns which you saw, and the 
beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make 
her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire. <A 
name=C17V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For God has put in their hearts to do 
what he has in mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the 
beast, until the words of God should be accomplished. <A name=C17V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The woman whom you 
saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth." 
<P><A name=C18V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things, I saw another angel 
coming down out of the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated 
with his glory. <A name=C18V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He cried with a mighty voice, saying, 
"Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, 
a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful 
bird! <A name=C18V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For all the nations have drunk of the 
wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed 
sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the 
abundance of her luxury." 
<P><A name=C18V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I heard another voice from heaven, 
saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, 
and that you don't receive of her plagues, <A name=C18V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for her sins have 
reached to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities. <A name=C18V6><FONT

glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning. 
For she says in her heart, 'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way 
see mourning.' <A name=C18V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep 
and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning, <A

after have been lost to you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have 
perished from you, and you will find them no more at all. <A name=C18V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The merchants of 
these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her 
torment, weeping and mourning; <A name=C18V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she 
who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and 
precious stones and pearls! <A name=C18V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<A name=C18V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

cried, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who 
had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!' For in 
one hour is she made desolate. 
<P><A name=C18V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her." <A

great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence will 
Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all. <A

<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God: <A name=C19V2><FONT

false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those

the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years, <A

<A name=C20V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as didn't worship 
the beast nor his image, and didn't receive the mark on their forehead and on 
their hand. They lived, and reigned with Christ for the thousand years. <A
