<H1>The Acts of the Apostles</H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The former treatise I made, O 
Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, <A 
name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>until the day in which he was received 
up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the 
apostles whom he had chosen: <A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To whom he also showed himself alive 
after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty 
days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God: <A name=C1V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and, being assembled 
together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait 
for the promise of the Father, which, <I>said he</I>, ye heard from me: <A 
name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not 
many days hence. <A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore, when they were come 
together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to 
Israel? <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, It is not for you 
to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority. <A 
name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be 
my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the 
uttermost part of the earth. <A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had said these things, as 
they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
<A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while they were looking stedfastly 
into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; <A 
name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why 
stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into 
heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven. <A 
name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from 
the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey 
off. <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were come in, they went 
up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and 
James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James <I>the 
son</I> of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas <I>the son</I> of James. <A 
name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These all with one accord continued 
stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his 
brethren. <A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in these days Peter stood up in the 
midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons 
<I>gathered</I> together, about a hundred and twenty), <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brethren, it was 
needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake 
before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took 
Jesus. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he was numbered among us, and 
received his portion in this ministry. <A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(Now this man obtained a field with the 
reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and 
all his bowels gushed out. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it became known to all the dwellers 
at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, 
that is, The field of blood.) <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is written in the book of 
Psalms, 
<P>&nbsp;Let his habitation be made desolate, 
<P>&nbsp;And let no man dwell therein: 
<P>and, 
<P>&nbsp;His office let another take. 
<P><A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Of the men therefore that have 
companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among 
us, <A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>beginning from the baptism of John, 
unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness 
with us of his resurrection. <A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they put forward two, Joseph called 
Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they prayed, 
and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the 
one whom thou hast chosen, <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to take the place in this ministry and 
apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place. <A 
name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they gave lots for them; and the 
lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 
<P>
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the day of Pentecost was now 
come, they were all together in one place. <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And suddenly there 
came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all 
the house where they were sitting. <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there appeared unto them tongues 
parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. <A 
name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other 
tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. <A name=C2V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were 
dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. <A 
name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, 
because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. <A 
name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak 
Galilaeans? <A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And how hear we, every man in our own 
language wherein we were born? <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and 
the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, <A 
name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in 
Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and 
sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Cretans and 
Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God. <A 
name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were all amazed, and were 
perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this? <A name=C2V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But others mocking 
said, They are filled with new wine. <A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, 
lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, <I>saying</I>, Ye men of Judaea, 
and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my 
words. <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For these are not drunken, as ye 
suppose; seeing it is <I>but</I> the third hour of the day. <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but this is that 
which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it shall be in the last days, saith 
God, 
<P>&nbsp;I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: 
<P>&nbsp;And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, 
<P>&nbsp;And your young men shall see visions, 
<P>&nbsp;And your old men shall dream dreams: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yea and on my servants and on my 
handmaidens in those days 
<P>&nbsp;Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I will show wonders in the heaven 
above, 
<P>&nbsp;And signs on the earth beneath; 
<P>&nbsp;Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sun shall be turned into darkness, 
<P>&nbsp;And the moon into blood, 
<P>&nbsp;Before the day of the Lord come, 
<P>&nbsp;That great and notable <I>day</I>. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it shall be, that whosoever shall 
call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
<P><A name=C2V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye men of Israel, hear these words: 
Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders 
and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know; 
<A name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>him, being delivered up by the 
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did 
crucify and slay: <A name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom God raised up, having loosed the 
pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. <A 
name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For David saith concerning him, 
<P>&nbsp;I beheld the Lord always before my face; 
<P>&nbsp;For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore my heart was glad, and my 
tongue rejoiced; 
<P>&nbsp;Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because thou wilt not leave my soul 
unto Hades, 
<P>&nbsp;Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou madest known unto me the ways of 
life; 
<P>&nbsp;Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance. 
<P><A name=C2V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brethren, I may say unto you freely of 
the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us 
unto this day. <A name=C2V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing 
that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would 
set <I>one</I> upon his throne; <A name=C2V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he foreseeing <I>this</I> spake of the 
resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his 
flesh see corruption. <A name=C2V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we 
all are witnesses. <A name=C2V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being therefore by the right hand of 
God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, 
he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear. <A name=C2V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For David ascended 
not into the heavens: but he saith himself, 
<P>&nbsp;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Till I make thine enemies the footstool 
of thy feet. 
<P><A name=C2V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let all the house of Israel therefore 
know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye 
crucified. <A name=C2V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they heard <I>this,</I> they 
were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, 
Brethren, what shall we do? <A name=C2V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter <I>said</I> unto them, Repent 
ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the 
remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <A 
name=C2V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For to you is the promise, and to your 
children, and to all that are afar off, <I>even</I> as many as the Lord our God 
shall call unto him. <A name=C2V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And with many other words he testified, 
and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. <A 
name=C2V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They then that received his word were 
baptized: and there were added <I>unto them</I> in that day about three thousand 
souls. <A name=C2V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they continued stedfastly in the 
apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. <A 
name=C2V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And fear came upon every soul: and many 
wonders and signs were done through the apostles. <A name=C2V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all that 
believed were together, and had all things common; <A name=C2V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they sold their 
possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need. <A 
name=C2V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And day by day, continuing stedfastly 
with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food 
with gladness and singleness of heart, <A name=C2V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>praising God, and having favor with all 
the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved. 
<P>
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Peter and John were going up into 
the temple at the hour of prayer, <I>being</I> the ninth <I>hour</I>. <A 
name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid 
daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them 
that entered into the temple; <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who seeing Peter and John about to go 
into the temple, asked to receive an alms. <A name=C3V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter, fastening 
his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us. <A name=C3V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he gave heed 
unto them, expecting to receive something from them. <A name=C3V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, 
Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took him by the right hand, and 
raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength. 
<A name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And leaping up, he stood, and began to 
walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and 
praising God. <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the people saw him walking and 
praising God: <A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they took knowledge of him, that it 
was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were 
filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. <A 
name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he held Peter and John, all the 
people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly 
wondering. <A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto 
the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your 
eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk? <A 
name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and 
of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye 
delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to 
release him. <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But ye denied the Holy and Righteous 
One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you, <A name=C3V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and killed the 
Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. <A 
name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And by faith in his name hath his name 
made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through 
him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. <A 
name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now, brethren, I know that in 
ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. <A name=C3V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the things 
which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should 
suffer, he thus fulfilled. <A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Repent ye therefore, and turn again, 
that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing 
from the presence of the Lord; <A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and that he may send the Christ who 
hath been appointed for you, <I>even</I> Jesus: <A name=C3V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom the heaven 
must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by 
the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old. <A name=C3V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moses indeed said, 
A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like 
unto me. To him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto 
you. <A name=C3V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it shall be, that every soul that 
shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the 
people. <A name=C3V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yea and all the prophets from Samuel 
and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these 
days. <A name=C3V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of 
the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy 
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. <A name=C3V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Unto you first God, 
having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one 
of you from your iniquities. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they spake unto the people, the 
priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, <A 
name=C4V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>being sore troubled because they taught 
the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. <A 
name=C4V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now 
eventide. <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But many of them that heard the word 
believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. <A 
name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were 
gathered together in Jerusalem; <A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Annas the high priest <I>was 
there</I>, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the 
kindred of the high priest. <A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had set them in the midst, 
they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? <A 
name=C4V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then 
Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and 
elders, <A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>if we this day are examined concerning a 
good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole; <A 
name=C4V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>be 
it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, 
<I>even</I> in him doth this man stand here before you whole. <A 
name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the 
head of the corner. <A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in none other is there salvation: 
for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, 
wherein we must be saved. <A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they beheld the boldness of 
Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, 
they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
<A name=C4V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And seeing the man that was healed 
standing with them, they could say nothing against it. <A name=C4V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when they had 
commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
<A name=C4V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, What shall we do to these men? 
for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to 
all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. <A name=C4V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But that it spread 
no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to 
no man in this name. <A name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they called them, and charged them 
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. <A name=C4V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter and John 
answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken 
unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: <A name=C4V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for we cannot but speak the things 
which we saw and heard. <A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, when they had further 
threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, 
because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. <A 
name=C4V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the man was more than forty years 
old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought. <A name=C4V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And being let go, 
they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the 
elders had said unto them. <A name=C4V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, when they heard it, lifted up 
their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the 
heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: <A name=C4V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who by the Holy 
Spirit, <I>by</I> the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, 
<P>&nbsp;Why did the Gentiles rage, 
<P>&nbsp;And the peoples imagine vain things? 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The kings of the earth set themselves 
in array, 
<P>&nbsp;And the rulers were gathered together, 
<P>&nbsp;Against the Lord, and against his Anointed: 
<P><A name=C4V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for of a truth in this city against thy 
holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with 
the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, <A 
name=C4V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to 
do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass. <A 
name=C4V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now, Lord, look upon their 
threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, 
<A name=C4V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while thy stretchest forth thy hand to 
heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy 
Servant Jesus. <A name=C4V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had prayed, the place was 
shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the 
Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness. <A name=C4V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the multitude 
of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one <I>of them</I> 
said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all 
things common. <A name=C4V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And with great power gave the apostles 
their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon 
them all. <A name=C4V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For neither was there among them any 
that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and 
brought the prices of the things that were sold, <A name=C4V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and laid them at 
the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one 
had need. <A name=C4V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Joseph, who by the apostles was 
surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a 
man of Cyprus by race, <A name=C4V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having a field, sold it, and brought 
the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a certain man named Ananias, with 
Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and kept back <I>part</I> of the price, 
his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the 
apostles' feet. <A name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan 
filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back <I>part</I> of the 
price of the land? <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While it remained, did it not remain 
thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou 
hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou has not lied unto men, but unto 
God. <A name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Ananias hearing these words fell 
down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it. <A 
name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried 
him. <A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was about the space of three 
hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. <A 
name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she 
said, Yea, for so much. <A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter <I>said</I> unto her, How is 
it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet 
of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee 
out. <A name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she fell down immediately at his 
feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and 
they carried her out and buried her by her husband. <A name=C5V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And great fear came 
upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things. <A name=C5V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And by the hands of 
the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were 
all with one accord in Solomon's porch. <A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But of the rest durst no man join 
himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them; <A name=C5V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and believers were 
the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of them and women; <A 
name=C5V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>insomuch that they even carried out the 
sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came 
by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them. <A 
name=C5V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there also came together the 
multitudes from the cities round about Jerusalem, bring sick folk, and them that 
were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. <A 
name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the high priest rose up, and all 
they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were 
filled with jealousy, <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and laid hands on the apostles, and put 
them in public ward. <A name=C5V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But an angel of the Lord by night 
opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said, <A name=C5V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Go ye, and stand 
and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life. <A 
name=C5V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they heard <I>this</I>, they 
entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, 
and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate 
of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought. <A 
name=C5V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the officers that came found them 
not in the prison; and they returned, and told, <A name=C5V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, The 
prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: 
but when we had opened, we found no man within. <A name=C5V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the 
captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much 
perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow. <A name=C5V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came one 
and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple 
standing and teaching the people. <A name=C5V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then went the captain with the 
officers, and brought them, <I>but</I> without violence; for they feared the 
people, lest they should be stoned. <A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had brought them, they 
set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, <A name=C5V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, We strictly 
charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with 
your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. <A name=C5V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter and the 
apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men. <A 
name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, 
whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree. <A name=C5V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Him did God exalt with his right hand 
<I>to be</I> a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission 
of sins. <A name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we are witnesses of these things; 
and <I>so is</I> the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him. <A 
name=C5V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they, when they heard this, were 
cut to the heart, and minded to slay them. <A name=C5V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there stood up 
one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in 
honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while. <A 
name=C5V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Ye men of 
Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do. 
<A name=C5V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For before these days rose up Theudas, 
giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, 
joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were 
dispersed, and came to nought. <A name=C5V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee 
in the days of the enrolment, and drew away <I>some of the</I> people after him: 
he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad. <A 
name=C5V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now I say unto you, Refrain from 
these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it 
will be overthrown: <A name=C5V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but if it is of God, ye will not be 
able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God. 
<A name=C5V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to him they agreed: and when they 
had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak 
in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <A name=C5V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore departed from the 
presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer 
dishonor for the Name. <A name=C5V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And every day, in the temple and at 
home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus <I>as</I> the Christ. 
<P>
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in these days, when the number of 
the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews 
against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily 
ministration. <A name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the twelve called the multitude of 
the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word 
of God, and serve tables. <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Look ye out therefore, brethren, from 
among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we 
may appoint over this business. <A name=C6V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we will continue stedfastly in 
prayer, and in the ministry of the word. <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the saying pleased the whole 
multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, 
and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a 
proselyte of Antioch; <A name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom they set before the apostles: and 
when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them. <A name=C6V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the word of God 
increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; 
and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. <A 
name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the 
people. <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there arose certain of them that 
were of the synagogue called <I>the synagogue</I> of the Libertines, and of the 
Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing 
with Stephen. <A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were not able to withstand the 
wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake. <A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they suborned men, who said, We 
have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and <I>against</I> God. <A 
name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they stirred up the people, and the 
elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into 
the council, <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and set up false witnesses, who said, 
This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law: <A 
name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for we have heard him say, that this 
Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which 
Moses delivered unto us. <A name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all that sat in the council, 
fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the high priest said, Are these 
things so? <A name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Brethren and fathers, 
hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in 
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said unto him, Get thee out of thy 
land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee. <A 
name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then 
came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, 
when his father was dead, <I>God</I> removed him into this land, wherein ye now 
dwell: <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he gave him none inheritance in it, 
no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to 
him in possession, and to his seed after him, when <I>as yet</I> he had no 
child. <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And God spake on this wise, that his 
seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into 
bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years. <A name=C7V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the nation to 
which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they 
come forth, and serve me in this place. <A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he gave him the covenant of 
circumcision: and so <I>Abraham</I> begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth 
day; and Isaac <I>begat</I> Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. <A 
name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God 
was with him, <A name=C7V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and delivered him out of all his 
afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he 
made him governor over Egypt and all his house. <A name=C7V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there came a 
famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no 
sustenance. <A name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Jacob heard that there was 
grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. <A name=C7V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And at the second 
time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's race became manifest 
unto Pharaoh. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Joseph sent, and called to him 
Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. <A 
name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he 
died, himself and our fathers; <A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they were carried over unto 
Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the 
sons of Hamor in Shechem. <A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as the time of the promise drew 
nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
<A name=C7V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>till there arose another king over 
Egypt, who knew not Joseph. <A name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same dealt craftily with our race, 
and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end 
they might not live. <A name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At which season Moses was born, and was 
exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father's house. <A 
name=C7V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when he was cast out, Pharaoh's 
daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. <A name=C7V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Moses was 
instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words 
and works. <A name=C7V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he was well-nigh forty years 
old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. <A 
name=C7V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And seeing one <I>of them</I> suffer 
wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the 
Egyptian: <A name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he supposed that his brethren 
understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood 
not. <A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the day following he appeared unto 
them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are 
brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? <A name=C7V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he that did his 
neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over 
us? <A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst 
the Egyptian yesterday? <A name=C7V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Moses fled at this saying, and 
became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. <A 
name=C7V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when forty years were fulfilled, an 
angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a 
bush. <A name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Moses saw it, he wondered at 
the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord, <A 
name=C7V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And 
Moses trembled, and durst not behold. <A name=C7V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord said unto him, Loose the 
shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. <A 
name=C7V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard 
their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send 
thee into Egypt. <A name=C7V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This Moses whom they refused, saying, 
Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent <I>to be</I> both a ruler 
and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush. <A 
name=C7V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This man led them forth, having wrought 
wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty 
years. <A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is that Moses, who said unto the 
children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your 
brethren, like unto me. <A name=C7V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is he that was in the church in 
the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our 
fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us: <A name=C7V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to whom our fathers 
would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts 
unto Egypt, <A name=C7V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that 
shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of 
Egypt, we know not what is become of him. <A name=C7V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they made a 
calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the 
works of their hands. <A name=C7V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But God turned, and gave them up to 
serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, 
<P>&nbsp;Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices 
<P>&nbsp;Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C7V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ye took up the tabernacle of 
Moloch, 
<P>&nbsp;And the star of the god Rephan, 
<P>&nbsp;The figures which ye made to worship them: 
<P>&nbsp;And I will carry you away beyond Babylon. 
<P><A name=C7V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Our fathers had the tabernacle of the 
testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he 
should make it according to the figure that he had seen. <A name=C7V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which also our 
fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the 
possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, 
unto the days of David; <A name=C7V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who found favor in the sight of God, 
and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. <A name=C7V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Solomon built 
him a house. <A name=C7V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in 
<I>houses</I> made with hands; as saith the prophet, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C7V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The heaven is my throne, 
<P>&nbsp;And the earth the footstool of my feet: 
<P>&nbsp;What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord: 
<P>&nbsp;Or what is the place of my rest? 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C7V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Did not my hand make all these things? 
<P><A name=C7V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in 
heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do 
ye. <A name=C7V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which of the prophets did not your 
fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the 
Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers; <A 
name=C7V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>ye 
who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not. <A 
name=C7V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they heard these things, they 
were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. <A 
name=C7V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, 
looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing 
on the right hand of God, <A name=C7V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, Behold, I see the heavens 
opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God. <A 
name=C7V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they cried out with a loud voice, 
and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; <A name=C7V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they cast him 
out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at 
the feet of a young man named Saul. <A name=C7V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon 
<I>the Lord</I>, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. <A name=C7V60><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he kneeled 
down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And 
when he had said this, he fell asleep. 
<P>
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Saul was consenting unto his death. 
And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in 
Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea 
and Samaria, except the apostles. <A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And devout men buried Stephen, and made 
great lamentation over him. <A name=C8V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul laid waste the church, entering 
into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison. <A 
name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They 
therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word. <A 
name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ. <A 
name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by 
Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. <A name=C8V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For <I>from</I> many 
of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and 
many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. <A name=C8V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was much 
joy in that city. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there was a certain man, Simon by 
name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, 
giving out that himself was some great one: <A name=C8V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to whom they all 
gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God 
which is called Great. <A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they gave heed to him, because that 
of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. <A name=C8V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when they 
believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the 
name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <A 
name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Simon also himself believed: and 
being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles 
wrought, he was amazed. <A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the apostles that were at 
Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them 
Peter and John: <A name=C8V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, when they were come down, prayed 
for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit: <A name=C8V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for as yet it was 
fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord 
Jesus. <A name=C8V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then laid they their hands on them, and 
they received the Holy Spirit. <A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Simon saw that through the 
laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them 
money, <A name=C8V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Give me also this power, that 
on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit. <A 
name=C8V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said unto him, Thy silver 
perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with 
money. <A name=C8V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this 
matter: for thy heart is not right before God. <A name=C8V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Repent therefore of 
this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart 
shall be forgiven thee. <A name=C8V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I see that thou art in the gall of 
bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. <A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Simon answered and said, Pray ye 
for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
<A name=C8V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore, when they had testified 
and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel 
to many villages of the Samaritans. <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But an angel of the Lord spake unto 
Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from 
Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert. <A name=C8V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he arose and went: and behold, a 
man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the 
Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship; 
<A name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he was returning and sitting in his 
chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. <A name=C8V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Spirit said 
unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. <A name=C8V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Philip ran to 
him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what 
thou readest? <A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, How can I, except some one 
shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him. <A 
name=C8V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the passage of the Scripture which 
he was reading was this, 
<P>&nbsp;He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; 
<P>&nbsp;And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, 
<P>&nbsp;So he openeth not his mouth: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In his humiliation his judgment was 
taken away: 
<P>&nbsp;His generation who shall declare? 
<P>&nbsp;For his life is taken from the earth. 
<P><A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the eunuch answered Philip, and 
said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some 
other? <A name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Philip opened his mouth, and 
beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus. <A name=C8V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they went on 
the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, <I>here 
is</I> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? <A name=C8V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>And Philip said, 
If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I 
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</I> <A name=C8V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he commanded 
the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip 
and the eunuch, and he baptized him. <A name=C8V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they came up out of the water, 
the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for 
he went on his way rejoicing. <A name=C8V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Philip was found at Azotus: and 
passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to 
Caesarea. 
<P>
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul, yet breathing threatening and 
slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, <A 
name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that 
were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
<A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he journeyed, it came to pass 
that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a 
light out of heaven: <A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he fell upon the earth, and heard a 
voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <A name=C9V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Who art 
thou, Lord? And he <I>said</I>, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: <A 
name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but 
rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. <A 
name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but 
beholding no man. <A name=C9V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Saul arose from the earth; and when 
his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought 
him into Damascus. <A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was three days without sight, and 
did neither eat nor drink. <A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was a certain disciple at 
Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he 
said, Behold, I <I>am here</I>, Lord. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord <I>said</I> unto him, 
Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house 
of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; <A 
name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he hath seen a man named Ananias 
coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. <A 
name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Ananias answered, Lord, I have 
heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: <A 
name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and here he hath authority from the 
chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. <A name=C9V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Lord said 
unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before 
the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: <A name=C9V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I will show him 
how many things he must suffer for my name's sake. <A name=C9V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Ananias 
departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother 
Saul, the Lord, <I>even</I> Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou 
camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the 
Holy Spirit. <A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway there fell from his 
eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was 
baptized; <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he took food and was strengthened. 
And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus. <A 
name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway in the synagogues he 
proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God. <A name=C9V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all that heard 
him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them 
that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might 
bring them bound before the chief priests. <A name=C9V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul increased 
the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving 
that this is the Christ. <A name=C9V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when many days were fulfilled, the 
Jews took counsel together to kill him: <A name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but their plot became known to Saul. 
And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him: <A 
name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but his disciples took him by night, 
and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. <A name=C9V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was 
come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were 
all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. <A name=C9V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Barnabas took 
him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the 
Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had 
preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was with them going in and going 
out at Jerusalem, <A name=C9V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>preaching boldly in the name of the 
Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking 
to kill him. <A name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the brethren knew it, they 
brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. <A name=C9V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the church 
throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, 
walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was 
multiplied. <A name=C9V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as Peter went 
throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda. <A 
name=C9V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there he found a certain man named 
Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied. <A 
name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus 
Christ healeth thee: arise and make thy bed. And straightway he arose. <A 
name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all that dwelt at Lydda and in 
Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. <A name=C9V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was at 
Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called 
Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. <A 
name=C9V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass in those days, that 
she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper 
chamber. <A name=C9V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the 
disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, 
Delay not to come on unto us. <A name=C9V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter arose and went with them. And 
when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows 
stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, 
while she was with them. <A name=C9V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter put them all forth, and 
kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And 
she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up. <A name=C9V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he gave her his 
hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her 
alive. <A name=C9V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it became known throughout all 
Joppa: and many believed on the Lord. <A name=C9V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that he abode many 
days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner. 
<P>
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now <I>there was</I> a certain man in 
Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian 
<I>band</I>, <A name=C10V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>a devout man, and one that feared God 
with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. 
<A name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saw in a vision openly, as it were 
about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying 
to him, Cornelius. <A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he, fastening his eyes upon him, 
and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers 
and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God. <A name=C10V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now send men to 
Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter: <A name=C10V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he lodgeth with one 
Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. <A name=C10V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the angel 
that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a 
devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; <A name=C10V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and having 
rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. <A name=C10V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the morrow, 
as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon 
the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour: <A name=C10V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he became 
hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance; <A 
name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he beholdeth the heaven opened, 
and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four 
corners upon the earth: <A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>wherein were all manner of fourfooted 
beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. <A 
name=C10V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came a voice to him, Rise, 
Peter; kill and eat. <A name=C10V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I 
have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. <A name=C10V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a voice 
<I>came</I> unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not 
thou common. <A name=C10V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this was done thrice: and 
straightway the vessel was received up into heaven. <A name=C10V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now while Peter 
was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, 
behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's 
house, stood before the gate, <A name=C10V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and called and asked whether Simon, 
who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there. <A name=C10V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while Peter 
thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. <A 
name=C10V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But arise, and get thee down, and go 
with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them. <A name=C10V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter went 
down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause 
wherefore ye are come? <A name=C10V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said, Cornelius a centurion, 
a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation 
of the Jews, was warned <I>of God</I> by a holy angel to send for thee into his 
house, and to hear words from thee. <A name=C10V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he called them in and lodged them. 
And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren 
from Joppa accompanied him. <A name=C10V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on the morrow they entered into 
Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen 
and his near friends. <A name=C10V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it came to pass that Peter 
entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. <A 
name=C10V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand 
up; I myself also am a man. <A name=C10V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he talked with him, he went in, 
and findeth many come together: <A name=C10V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he said unto them, Ye yourselves 
know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come 
unto one of another nation; and <I>yet</I> unto me hath God showed that I should 
not call any man common or unclean: <A name=C10V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>wherefore also I came without 
gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for 
me. <A name=C10V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Cornelius said, Four days ago, 
until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, 
a man stood before me in bright apparel, <A name=C10V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saith, 
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the 
sight of God. <A name=C10V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto 
thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by 
the sea side. <A name=C10V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; 
and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here 
present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of 
the Lord. <A name=C10V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter opened his mouth and said, 
Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: <A name=C10V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but in every 
nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him. <A 
name=C10V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The word which he sent unto the 
children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord 
of all.) -- <A name=C10V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that saying ye yourselves know, which 
was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism 
which John preached; <A name=C10V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>even</I> Jesus of Nazareth, how God 
anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and 
healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. <A 
name=C10V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we are witnesses of all things 
which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they 
slew, hanging him on a tree. <A name=C10V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Him God raised up the third day, and 
gave him to be made manifest, <A name=C10V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>not to all the people, but unto 
witnesses that were chosen before of God, <I>even</I> to us, who ate and drank 
with him after he rose from the dead. <A name=C10V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he charged us to preach unto the 
people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God <I>to be</I> the 
Judge of the living and the dead. <A name=C10V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To him bear all the prophets witness, 
that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of 
sins. <A name=C10V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While Peter yet spake these words, the 
Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word. <A name=C10V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they of the 
circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that 
on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. <A 
name=C10V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they heard them speak with 
tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, <A name=C10V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Can any man forbid 
the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit 
as well as we? <A name=C10V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he commanded them to be baptized 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. 
<P>
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the apostles and the brethren that 
were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. <A 
name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Peter was come up to 
Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, <A 
name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Thou wentest in to men 
uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter began, and expounded <I>the 
matter</I> unto them in order, saying, <A name=C11V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and 
in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great 
sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me: <A 
name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>upon which when I had fastened mine 
eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts 
and creeping things and birds of the heaven. <A name=C11V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard also a 
voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. <A name=C11V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I said, Not so, 
Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth. <A 
name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a voice answered the second time 
out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common. <A 
name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this was done thrice: and all were 
drawn up again into heaven. <A name=C11V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, forthwith three men stood 
before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me. <A 
name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Spirit bade me go with them, 
making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we 
entered into the man's house: <A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he told us how he had seen the 
angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose 
surname is Peter; <A name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who shall speak unto thee words, 
whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house. <A name=C11V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as I began to 
speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. <A 
name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I remembered the word of the Lord, 
how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the 
Holy Spirit. <A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If then God gave unto them the like 
gift as <I>he did</I> also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
who was I, that I could withstand God? <A name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they heard these things, they 
held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God 
granted repentance unto life. <A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore that were scattered 
abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as 
Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews. 
<A name=C11V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there were some of them, men of 
Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks 
also, preaching the Lord Jesus. <A name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the hand of the Lord was with 
them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord. <A 
name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the report concerning them came to 
the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as 
far as Antioch: <A name=C11V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, when he was come, and had seen 
the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart 
they would cleave unto the Lord: <A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he was a good man, and full of the 
Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. <A 
name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went forth to Tarsus to seek 
for Saul; <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when he had found him, he brought 
him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were 
gathered together with the church, and taught much people, and that the 
disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. <A name=C11V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in these days 
there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. <A name=C11V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there stood up 
one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a 
great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius. <A 
name=C11V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the disciples, every man according 
to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea: 
<A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which also they did, sending it to the 
elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. 
<P>
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now about that time Herod the king put 
forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. <A name=C12V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he killed James 
the brother of John with the sword. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he saw that it pleased the 
Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And <I>those</I> were the days of 
unleavened bread. <A name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had taken him, he put him 
in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; 
intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people. <A 
name=C12V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter therefore was kept in the prison: 
but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him. <A 
name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Herod was about to bring him 
forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two 
chains: and guards before the door kept the prison. <A name=C12V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, an 
angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote 
Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell 
off from his hands. <A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel said unto him, Gird 
thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy 
garment about thee, and follow me. <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went out, and followed; and he 
knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a 
vision. <A name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were past the first and 
the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which 
opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one 
street; and straightway the angel departed from him. <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Peter was 
come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth 
his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the 
expectation of the people of the Jews. <A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had considered <I>the 
thing</I>, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was 
Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying. <A name=C12V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he 
knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda. <A 
name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when she knew Peter's voice, she 
opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the 
gate. <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto her, Thou art mad. 
But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his 
angel. <A name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter continued knocking: and when 
they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed. <A name=C12V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he, beckoning 
unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had 
brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, 
and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place. <A 
name=C12V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now as soon as it was day, there was 
no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. <A name=C12V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Herod had 
sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that 
they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and 
tarried there. <A name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he was highly displeased with them 
of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made 
Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their 
country was fed from the king's country. <A name=C12V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And upon a set day 
Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an 
oration unto them. <A name=C12V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the people shouted, <I>saying</I>, 
The voice of a god, and not of a man. <A name=C12V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And immediately an angel of the Lord 
smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and 
gave up the ghost. <A name=C12V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the word of God grew and 
multiplied. <A name=C12V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Barnabas and Saul returned from 
Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John 
whose surname was Mark. 
<P>
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there were at Antioch, in the 
church that was <I>there</I>, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that 
was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod 
the tetrarch, and Saul. <A name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they ministered to the Lord, and 
fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work 
whereunto I have called them. <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then, when they had fasted and prayed 
and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. <A name=C13V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they, being sent 
forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to 
Cyprus. <A name=C13V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were at Salamis, they 
proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John 
as their attendant. <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had gone through the 
whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, 
whose name was Bar-jesus; <A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who was with the proconsul, Sergius 
Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and 
sought to hear the word of God. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his 
name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from 
the faith. <A name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Saul, who is also <I>called</I> 
Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him, <A 
name=C13V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, O full of all guile and all 
villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not 
cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? <A name=C13V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now, behold, 
the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun 
for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he 
went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. <A name=C13V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the 
proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching 
of the Lord. <A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Paul and his company set sail from 
Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned 
to Jerusalem. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they, passing through from Perga, 
came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, 
and sat down. <A name=C13V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after the reading of the law and 
the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye 
have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. <A name=C13V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul stood up, 
and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken: 
<A name=C13V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God of this people Israel chose 
our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, 
and with a high arm led he them forth out of it. <A name=C13V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And for about the 
time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness. <A 
name=C13V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had destroyed seven 
nations in the land of Canaan, he gave <I>them</I> their land for an 
inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years: <A name=C13V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and after these 
things he gave <I>them</I> judges until Samuel the prophet. <A name=C13V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And afterward they 
asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the 
tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years. <A name=C13V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had 
removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness 
and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who shall 
do all My will. <A name=C13V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Of this man's seed hath God according 
to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus; <A name=C13V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>when John had 
first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of 
Israel. <A name=C13V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as John was fulfilling his course, 
he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not <I>he</I>. But behold, there cometh 
one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose. <A 
name=C13V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brethren, children of the stock of 
Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation 
sent forth. <A name=C13V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and 
their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which 
are read every sabbath, fulfilled <I>them</I> by condemning <I>him</I>. <A 
name=C13V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And though they found no cause of 
death <I>in him</I>, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain. <A 
name=C13V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had fulfilled all things 
that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a 
tomb. <A name=C13V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But God raised him from the dead: <A 
name=C13V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he was seen for many days of them 
that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto 
the people. <A name=C13V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we bring you good tidings of the 
promise made unto the fathers, <A name=C13V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that God hath fulfilled the same unto 
our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second 
psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. <A name=C13V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as concerning 
that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he 
hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure <I>blessings</I> of 
David. <A name=C13V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because he saith also in another 
<I>psalm</I>, Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption. <A 
name=C13V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For David, after he had in his own 
generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his 
fathers, and saw corruption: <A name=C13V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he whom God raised up saw no 
corruption. <A name=C13V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be it known unto you therefore, 
brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: <A 
name=C13V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and by him every one that believeth is 
justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of 
Moses. <A name=C13V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Beware therefore, lest that come upon 
<I>you</I> which is spoken in the prophets: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C13V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and 
perish; 
<P>&nbsp;For I work a work in your days, 
<P>&nbsp;A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you. 
<P><A name=C13V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they went out, they besought 
that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath. <A name=C13V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the 
synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul 
and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. 
<A name=C13V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the next sabbath almost the whole 
city was gathered together to hear the word of God. <A name=C13V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the Jews 
saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things 
which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed. <A name=C13V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul and 
Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God 
should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge 
yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. <A 
name=C13V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For so hath the Lord commanded us, 
<I>saying</I>, 
<P>&nbsp;I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, 
<P>&nbsp;That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the 
earth. 
<P><A name=C13V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as the Gentiles heard this, they 
were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to 
eternal life believed. <A name=C13V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the word of the Lord was spread 
abroad throughout all the region. <A name=C13V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Jews urged on the devout women 
of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution 
against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders. <A 
name=C13V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they shook off the dust of their 
feet against them, and came unto Iconium. <A name=C13V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the disciples 
were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit. 
<P>
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass in Iconium that 
they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great 
multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. <A name=C14V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Jews that 
were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil 
affected against the brethren. <A name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Long time therefore they tarried 
<I>there</I> speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his 
grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <A name=C14V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the multitude 
of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the 
apostles. <A name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when there was made an onset both 
of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and 
to stone them, <A name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they became aware of it, and fled unto 
the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about: <A 
name=C14V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there they preached the gospel. <A 
name=C14V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And at Lystra there sat a certain man, 
impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked. <A 
name=C14V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same heard Paul speaking, who, 
fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, <A 
name=C14V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>said with a loud voice, Stand upright 
on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. <A name=C14V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the 
multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the 
speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. <A 
name=C14V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and 
Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. <A name=C14V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the priest of 
Jupiter whose <I>temple</I> was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto 
the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes. <A 
name=C14V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the apostles, Barnabas and 
Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the 
multitude, crying out <A name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saying, Sirs, why do ye these 
things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, 
that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the 
heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: <A name=C14V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who in the 
generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways. <A 
name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And yet He left not himself without 
witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful 
seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. <A name=C14V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And with these 
sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them. <A 
name=C14V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there came Jews thither from 
Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and 
dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. <A name=C14V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as the 
disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on 
the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. <A name=C14V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had 
preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to 
Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch, <A name=C14V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>confirming the souls of the disciples, 
exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we 
must enter into the kingdom of God. <A name=C14V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had appointed for them 
elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the 
Lord, on whom they had believed. <A name=C14V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they passed through Pisidia, and 
came to Pamphylia. <A name=C14V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had spoken the word in 
Perga, they went down to Attalia; <A name=C14V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and thence they sailed to Antioch, 
from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they 
had fulfilled. <A name=C14V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were come, and had 
gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with 
them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles. <A 
name=C14V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they tarried no little time with 
the disciples. 
<P>
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And certain men came down from Judaea 
and taught the brethren, <I>saying</I>, Except ye be circumcised after the 
custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved. <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Paul and Barnabas had no small 
dissension and questioning with them, <I>the brethren</I> appointed that Paul 
and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the 
apostles and elders about this question. <A name=C15V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They therefore, being brought on their 
way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the 
conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. <A 
name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were come to Jerusalem, 
they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they 
rehearsed all things that God had done with them. <A name=C15V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there rose up 
certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to 
circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses. <A 
name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the apostles and the elders were 
gathered together to consider of this matter. <A name=C15V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when there had 
been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that 
a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should 
hear the word of the gospel, and believe. <A name=C15V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And God, who 
knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he 
did unto us; <A name=C15V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he made no distinction between us 
and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. <A name=C15V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now therefore why 
make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples 
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? <A name=C15V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we believe 
that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as 
they. <A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the multitude kept silence; 
and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God 
had wrought among the Gentiles through them. <A name=C15V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after they had 
held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me: <A 
name=C15V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Symeon hath rehearsed how first God 
visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. <A 
name=C15V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to this agree the words of the 
prophets; as it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things I will return, 
<P>&nbsp;And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; 
<P>&nbsp;And I will build again the ruins thereof, 
<P>&nbsp;And I will set it up: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That the residue of men may seek after 
the Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C15V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Saith the Lord, who maketh these 
things known from of old. 
<P><A name=C15V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore my judgment is, that we 
trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God; <A name=C15V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but that we write 
unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, 
and from what is strangled, and from blood. <A name=C15V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Moses from 
generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the 
synagogues every sabbath. <A name=C15V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then it seemed good to the apostles 
and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and 
send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; <I>namely</I>, Judas called 
Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: <A name=C15V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they wrote 
<I>thus</I> by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren 
who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting: <A 
name=C15V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Forasmuch as we have heard that 
certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your 
souls; to whom we gave no commandment; <A name=C15V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>it seemed good unto us, having come to 
one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas 
and Paul, <A name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>men that have hazarded their lives for 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <A name=C15V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We have sent therefore Judas and 
Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. <A 
name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, 
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: <A 
name=C15V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that ye abstain from things sacrificed 
to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from 
which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well. <A 
name=C15V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they, when they were dismissed, 
came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered 
the epistle. <A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had read it, they 
rejoiced for the consolation. <A name=C15V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Judas and Silas, being themselves 
also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. <A 
name=C15V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after they had spent some time 
<I>there</I>, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had 
sent them forth. <A name=C15V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>But it seemed good unto Silas to 
abide there.</I> <A name=C15V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul and Barnabas tarried in 
Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. <A 
name=C15V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after some days Paul said unto 
Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we 
proclaimed the word of the Lord, <I>and see</I> how they fare. <A 
name=C15V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Barnabas was minded to take with 
them John also, who was called Mark. <A name=C15V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul thought not good to take with 
them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the 
work. <A name=C15V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there arose a sharp contention, so 
that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, 
and sailed away unto Cyprus; <A name=C15V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, 
being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. <A name=C15V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went 
through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. 
<P>
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came also to Derbe and to 
Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a 
Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek. <A name=C16V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same was well 
reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. <A name=C16V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Him would Paul have 
to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that 
were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <A 
name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they went on their way through 
the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of 
the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. <A name=C16V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the churches 
were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily. <A 
name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went through the region of 
Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word 
in Asia; <A name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they were come over against 
Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them 
not; <A name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and passing by Mysia, they came down to 
Troas. <A name=C16V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a vision appeared to Paul in the 
night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come 
over into Macedonia, and help us. <A name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had seen the vision, 
straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called 
us to preach the gospel to them. <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Setting sail therefore from Troas, we 
made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; <A 
name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and from thence to Philippi, which is 
a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a <I>Roman</I> colony: and we 
were in this city tarrying certain days. <A name=C16V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on the sabbath 
day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was 
a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come 
together. <A name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain woman named Lydia, a 
seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: 
whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by 
Paul. <A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when she was baptized, and her 
household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the 
Lord, come into my house, and abide <I>there</I>. And she constrained us. <A 
name=C16V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as we were going 
to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met 
us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. <A name=C16V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The same following 
after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High 
God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. <A name=C16V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this she did 
for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I 
charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that 
very hour. <A name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when her masters saw that the hope 
of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into 
the marketplace before the rulers, <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they had brought them unto 
the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our 
city, <A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and set forth customs which it is not 
lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans. <A name=C16V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the multitude 
rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, 
and commanded to beat them with rods. <A name=C16V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had laid many stripes 
upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 
<A name=C16V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, having received such a charge, 
cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. <A 
name=C16V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But about midnight Paul and Silas were 
praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them; <A 
name=C16V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and suddenly there was a great 
earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and 
immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. <A 
name=C16V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the jailor, being roused out of 
sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill 
himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. <A name=C16V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul cried 
with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. <A 
name=C16V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called for lights and sprang 
in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, <A 
name=C16V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and brought them out and said, Sirs, 
what must I do to be saved? <A name=C16V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said, Believe on the Lord 
Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. <A name=C16V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they spake the 
word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house. <A name=C16V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took them 
the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and 
all his, immediately. <A name=C16V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he brought them up into his house, 
and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having 
believed in God. <A name=C16V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when it was day, the magistrates 
sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go. <A name=C16V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the jailor 
reported the words to Paul, <I>saying</I>, The magistrates have sent to let you 
go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace. <A name=C16V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul said unto 
them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have 
cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let 
them come themselves and bring us out. <A name=C16V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the sergeants reported these words 
unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans; <A 
name=C16V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they came and besought them; and 
when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city. <A 
name=C16V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went out of the prison, and 
entered into <I>the house</I> of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, 
they comforted them, and departed. 
<P>
<P><A name=C17V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they had passed through 
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of 
the Jews: <A name=C17V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Paul, as his custom was, went in 
unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <A 
name=C17V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>opening and alleging that it behooved 
the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, 
whom, <I>said he,</I> I proclaim unto you, is the Christ. <A name=C17V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some of them 
were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a 
great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. <A name=C17V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Jews, being 
moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and 
gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, 
they sought to bring them forth to the people. <A name=C17V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they found 
them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, 
crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; <A 
name=C17V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom Jason hath received: and these all 
act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, 
<I>one</I> Jesus. <A name=C17V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they troubled the multitude and the 
rulers of the city, when they heard these things. <A name=C17V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had 
taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. <A name=C17V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the brethren 
immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were 
come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. <A name=C17V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now these were 
more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all 
readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were 
so. <A name=C17V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many of them therefore believed; also 
of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few. <A 
name=C17V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had 
knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came 
thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes. <A name=C17V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And then 
immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas 
and Timothy abode there still. <A name=C17V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they that conducted Paul brought 
him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that 
they should come to him with all speed, they departed. <A name=C17V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now while Paul 
waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the 
city full of idols. <A name=C17V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he reasoned in the synagogue with 
Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met 
him. <A name=C17V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And certain also of the Epicurean and 
Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? 
others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached 
Jesus and the resurrection. <A name=C17V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they took hold of him, and brought 
him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is 
spoken by thee? <A name=C17V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For thou bringest certain strange 
things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. <A 
name=C17V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(Now all the Athenians and the 
strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell 
or to hear some new thing.) <A name=C17V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul stood in the midst of the 
Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are 
very religious. <A name=C17V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as I passed along, and observed 
the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN 
UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you. 
<A name=C17V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God that made the world and all 
things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made 
with hands; <A name=C17V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>neither is he served by men's hands, 
as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, 
and all things; <A name=C17V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he made of one every nation of men 
to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined <I>their</I> appointed 
seasons, and the bounds of their habitation; <A name=C17V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that they should 
seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far 
from each one of us: <A name=C17V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for in him we live, and move, and have 
our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his 
offspring. <A name=C17V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being then the offspring of God, we 
ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, 
graven by art and device of man. <A name=C17V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The times of ignorance therefore God 
overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent: <A 
name=C17V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in 
which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; 
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from 
the dead. <A name=C17V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they heard of the 
resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee 
concerning this yet again. <A name=C17V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thus Paul went out from among them. <A 
name=C17V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But certain men clave unto him, and 
believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named 
Damaris, and others with them. 
<P>
<P><A name=C18V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things he departed from 
Athens, and came to Corinth. <A name=C18V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he found a certain Jew named 
Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife 
Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and 
he came unto them; <A name=C18V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and because he was of the same trade, 
he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers. 
<A name=C18V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he reasoned in the synagogue every 
sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. <A name=C18V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Silas and Timothy came down 
from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that 
Jesus was the Christ. <A name=C18V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they opposed themselves and 
blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood <I>be</I> 
upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. <A 
name=C18V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he departed thence, and went into 
the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose 
house joined hard to the synagogue. <A name=C18V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Crispus, the ruler of the 
synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians 
hearing believed, and were baptized. <A name=C18V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord said unto Paul in the 
night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace: <A 
name=C18V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I am with thee, and no man shall 
set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city. <A 
name=C18V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he dwelt <I>there</I> a year and 
six months, teaching the word of God among them. <A name=C18V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Gallio 
was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and 
brought him before the judgment-seat, <A name=C18V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, This man persuadeth men to 
worship God contrary to the law. <A name=C18V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul was about to open his 
mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of 
wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: <A 
name=C18V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but if they are questions about words 
and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge 
of these matters. <A name=C18V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he drove them from the 
judgment-seat. <A name=C18V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, 
the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio 
cared for none of these things. <A name=C18V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul, having tarried after this 
yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and 
with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a 
vow. <A name=C18V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came to Ephesus, and he left 
them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the 
Jews. <A name=C18V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they asked him to abide a 
longer time, he consented not; <A name=C18V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but taking his leave of them, and 
saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus. <A 
name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had landed at Caesarea, he 
went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch. <A name=C18V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And having spent 
some time <I>there</I>, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and 
Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples. <A name=C18V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now a certain Jew 
named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he 
was mighty in the scriptures. <A name=C18V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This man had been instructed in the 
way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the 
things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John: <A name=C18V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he began to 
speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they 
took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately. <A 
name=C18V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was minded to pass over 
into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive 
him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace; 
<A name=C18V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he powerfully confuted the Jews, 
<I>and that</I> publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. 
<P>
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that, while 
Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to 
Ephesus, and found certain disciples: <A name=C19V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he said unto them, Did ye receive 
the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they <I>said</I> unto him, Nay, we did not 
so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was <I>given</I>. <A name=C19V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Into 
what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. <A 
name=C19V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul said, John baptized with the 
baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him 
that should come after him, that is, on Jesus. <A name=C19V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they heard 
this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <A name=C19V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Paul had 
laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with 
tongues, and prophesied. <A name=C19V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were in all about twelve men. 
<A name=C19V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he entered into the synagogue, and 
spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading <I>as 
to</I> the things concerning the kingdom of God. <A name=C19V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when some were 
hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he 
departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school 
of Tyrannus. <A name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this continued for the space of 
two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both 
Jews and Greeks. <A name=C19V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And God wrought special miracles by 
the hands of Paul: <A name=C19V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>insomuch that unto the sick were 
carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went 
out. <A name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But certain also of the strolling 
Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the 
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. <A 
name=C19V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were seven sons of one 
Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this. <A name=C19V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the evil 
spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are 
ye? <A name=C19V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the man in whom the evil spirit 
was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so 
that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <A name=C19V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this became 
known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon 
them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. <A name=C19V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many also of them 
that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds. <A 
name=C19V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And not a few of them that practised 
magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; 
and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of 
silver. <A name=C19V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So mightily grew the word of the Lord 
and prevailed. <A name=C19V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after these things were ended, 
Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to 
go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. <A 
name=C19V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And having sent into Macedonia two of 
them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia 
for a while. <A name=C19V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And about that time there arose no 
small stir concerning the Way. <A name=C19V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For a certain man named Demetrius, a 
silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto 
the craftsmen; <A name=C19V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom he gathered together, with the 
workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we 
have our wealth. <A name=C19V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ye see and hear, that not alone at 
Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned 
away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands: <A 
name=C19V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and not only is there danger that this 
our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess 
Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her 
magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. <A name=C19V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they 
heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of 
the Ephesus. <A name=C19V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the city was filled with the 
confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius 
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel. <A 
name=C19V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Paul was minded to enter in 
unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. <A name=C19V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And certain also 
of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to 
adventure himself into the theatre. <A name=C19V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some therefore cried one thing, and 
some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not 
wherefore they were come together. <A name=C19V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they brought Alexander out of the 
multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, 
and would have made a defense unto the people. <A name=C19V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when they 
perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours 
cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. <A name=C19V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the 
townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is 
there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the 
great Diana, and of the <I>image</I> which fell down from Jupiter? <A 
name=C19V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing then that these things cannot 
be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash. <A name=C19V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye have 
brought <I>hither</I> these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor 
blasphemers of our goddess. <A name=C19V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore Demetrius, and the 
craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, 
and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another. <A name=C19V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if ye seek 
anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. <A 
name=C19V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For indeed we are in danger to be 
accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause <I>for it</I>: and as 
touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse. <A 
name=C19V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had thus spoken, he 
dismissed the assembly. 
<P>
<P><A name=C20V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after the uproar ceased, Paul 
having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and 
departed to go into Macedonia. <A name=C20V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had gone through those 
parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece. <A 
name=C20V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had spent three months 
<I>there,</I> and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set 
sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia. <A name=C20V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there 
accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, <I>the son</I> of Pyrrhus; 
and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and 
Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. <A name=C20V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But these had gone 
before, and were waiting for us at Troas. <A name=C20V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we sailed away 
from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in 
five days, where we tarried seven days. <A name=C20V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And upon the first day of the week, 
when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, 
intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight. <A 
name=C20V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were many lights in the upper 
chamber where we were gathered together. <A name=C20V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there sat in the window a certain 
young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet 
longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was 
taken up dead. <A name=C20V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul went down, and fell on him, 
and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him. <A 
name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was gone up, and had 
broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till 
break of day, so he departed. <A name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they brought the lad alive, and 
were not a little comforted. <A name=C20V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we going before to the ship set 
sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, 
intending himself to go by land. <A name=C20V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he met us at Assos, we took 
him in, and came to Mitylene. <A name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And sailing from thence, we came the 
following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the 
day after we came to Miletus. <A name=C20V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Paul had determined to sail past 
Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if 
it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. <A 
name=C20V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, 
and called to him the elders of the church. <A name=C20V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were 
come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I 
set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time, <A 
name=C20V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>serving the Lord with all lowliness of 
mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews; 
<A name=C20V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how I shrank not from declaring unto 
you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to 
house, <A name=C20V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks 
repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. <A 
name=C20V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now, behold, I go bound in the 
spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: <A 
name=C20V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>save that the Holy Spirit testifieth 
unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. <A 
name=C20V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I hold not my life of any account 
as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which 
I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. <A 
name=C20V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now, behold, I know that ye all, 
among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more. <A 
name=C20V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore I testify unto you this day, 
that I am pure from the blood of all men. <A name=C20V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I shrank not 
from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God. <A name=C20V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take heed unto 
yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you 
bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood. 
<A name=C20V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know that after my departing 
grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock; <A 
name=C20V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and from among your own selves shall 
men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. <A 
name=C20V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore watch ye, remembering that 
by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day 
with tears. <A name=C20V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now I commend you to God, and to 
the word of his grace, which is able to build <I>you</I> up, and to give 
<I>you</I> the inheritance among all them that are sanctified. <A 
name=C20V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or 
apparel. <A name=C20V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye yourselves know that these hands 
ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. <A 
name=C20V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In all things I gave you an example, 
that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the 
Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. <A 
name=C20V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had thus spoken, he 
kneeled down and prayed with them all. <A name=C20V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they all wept sore, and fell on 
Paul's neck and kissed him, <A name=C20V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>sorrowing most of all for the word 
which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought 
him on his way unto the ship. 
<P>
<P><A name=C21V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it came to pass that were 
parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and 
the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: <A name=C21V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and having found a 
ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. <A 
name=C21V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we had come in sight of 
Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; 
for there the ship was to unlade her burden. <A name=C21V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And having found 
the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the 
Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem. <A name=C21V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it came to 
pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and 
they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the 
city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell; 
<A name=C21V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and we went on board the ship, but they 
returned home again. <A name=C21V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we had finished the voyage 
from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with 
them one day. <A name=C21V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on the morrow we departed, and came 
unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one 
of the seven, we abode with him. <A name=C21V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now this man had four virgin daughters, 
who prophesied. <A name=C21V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as we tarried there some days, 
there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. <A 
name=C21V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And coming to us, and taking Paul's 
girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, 
So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall 
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. <A name=C21V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we heard 
these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to 
Jerusalem. <A name=C21V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Paul answered, What do ye, 
weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to 
die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. <A name=C21V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he would 
not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. <A 
name=C21V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these days we took up our 
baggage and went up to Jerusalem. <A name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there went with us also 
<I>certain</I> of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing <I>with them</I> one 
Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge. <A 
name=C21V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we were come to Jerusalem, 
the brethren received us gladly. <A name=C21V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the day following Paul went in 
with us unto James; and all the elders were present. <A name=C21V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had 
saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the 
Gentiles through his ministry. <A name=C21V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, when they heard it, 
glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands 
there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous 
for the law: <A name=C21V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they have been informed concerning 
thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake 
Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the 
customs. <A name=C21V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What is it therefore? They will 
certainly hear that thou art come. <A name=C21V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do therefore this that we say to thee: 
We have four men that have a vow on them; <A name=C21V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>these take, and 
purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their 
heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have 
been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, 
keeping the law. <A name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as touching the Gentiles that have 
believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things 
sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from 
fornication. <A name=C21V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Paul took the men, and the next 
day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment 
of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of 
them. <A name=C21V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the seven days were almost 
completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all 
the multitude and laid hands on him, <A name=C21V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>crying out, Men of Israel, help: This 
is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and 
this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath 
defiled this holy place. <A name=C21V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they had before seen with him in 
the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into 
the temple. <A name=C21V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the city was moved, and the 
people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the 
temple: and straightway the doors were shut. <A name=C21V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they were 
seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all 
Jerusalem was in confusion. <A name=C21V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And forthwith he took soldiers and 
centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain 
and the soldiers, left off beating Paul. <A name=C21V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the chief 
captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two 
chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done. <A name=C21V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some shouted 
one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the 
certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle. <A 
name=C21V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he came upon the stairs, so 
it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd; <A 
name=C21V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for the multitude of the people 
followed after, crying out, Away with him. <A name=C21V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as Paul was 
about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say 
something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek? <A name=C21V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Art thou not then 
the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the 
wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins? <A name=C21V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul said, I 
am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, 
give me leave to speak unto the people. <A name=C21V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had given him leave, Paul, 
standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there 
was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying, 
<P>
<P><A name=C22V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brethren and fathers, hear ye the 
defence which I now make unto you. <A name=C22V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they heard that he spake unto 
them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith, <A 
name=C22V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of 
Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, 
being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day: <A name=C22V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and I persecuted 
this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. 
<A name=C22V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As also the high priest doth bear me 
witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters 
unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there 
unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished. <A name=C22V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that, as I made my 
journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from 
heaven a great light round about me. <A name=C22V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I fell unto the ground, and heard a 
voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <A name=C22V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I answered, Who 
art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou 
persecutest. <A name=C22V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that were with me beheld 
indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. <A 
name=C22V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And 
the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told 
thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. <A name=C22V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when I could 
not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were 
with me I came into Damascus. <A name=C22V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one Ananias, a devout man 
according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, <A 
name=C22V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>came unto me, and standing by me said 
unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on 
him. <A name=C22V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, The God of our fathers 
hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear 
a voice from his mouth. <A name=C22V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For thou shalt be a witness for him 
unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. <A name=C22V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now why 
tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his 
name. <A name=C22V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that, when I had 
returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance, 
<A name=C22V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saw him saying unto me, Make 
haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of 
thee testimony concerning me. <A name=C22V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I said, Lord, they themselves know 
that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: <A 
name=C22V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when the blood of Stephen thy 
witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the 
garments of them that slew him. <A name=C22V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto me, Depart: for I 
will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles. <A name=C22V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they gave him 
audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with 
such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. <A 
name=C22V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they cried out, and threw off 
their garments, and cast dust into the air, <A name=C22V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the chief captain 
commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by 
scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him. <A 
name=C22V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had tied him up with the 
thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to 
scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? <A name=C22V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the 
centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art 
thou about to do? for this man is a Roman. <A name=C22V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief 
captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea. <A 
name=C22V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief captain answered, With a 
great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am <I>a Roman</I> 
born. <A name=C22V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They then that were about to examine 
him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he 
knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. <A name=C22V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But on the morrow, 
desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed 
him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and 
brought Paul down and set him before them. 
<P>
<P><A name=C23V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul, looking stedfastly on the 
council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until 
this day. <A name=C23V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the high priest Ananias commanded 
them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. <A name=C23V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then said Paul unto 
him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me 
according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? <A 
name=C23V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that stood by said, Revilest 
thou God's high priest? <A name=C23V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, 
that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler 
of thy people. <A name=C23V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul perceived that the one 
part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, 
Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and 
resurrection of the dead I am called in question. <A name=C23V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had so 
said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the 
assembly was divided. <A name=C23V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Sadducees say that there is no 
resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. <A 
name=C23V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there arose a great clamor: and 
some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find 
no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel? <A 
name=C23V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when there arose a great 
dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by 
them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, 
and bring him into the castle. <A name=C23V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the night following the Lord stood 
by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at 
Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. <A name=C23V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was 
day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that 
they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. <A name=C23V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were more 
than forty that made this conspiracy. <A name=C23V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came to the chief priests and 
the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste 
nothing until we have killed Paul. <A name=C23V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now therefore do ye with the council 
signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would 
judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay 
him. <A name=C23V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul's sister's son heard of their 
lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul. <A 
name=C23V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul called unto him one of the 
centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath 
something to tell him. <A name=C23V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So he took him, and brought him to the 
chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to 
bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee. <A 
name=C23V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief captain took him by the 
hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me? 
<A name=C23V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, The Jews have agreed to 
ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest 
inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him. <A name=C23V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do not thou 
therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty 
men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till 
they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee. 
<A name=C23V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the chief captain let the young man 
go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me. <A 
name=C23V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called unto him two of the 
centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, 
and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of 
the night: <A name=C23V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and <I>he bade them</I> provide 
beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the 
governor. <A name=C23V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he wrote a letter after this form: 
<A name=C23V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Claudius Lysias unto the most 
excellent governor Felix, greeting. <A name=C23V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This man was seized by the Jews, and 
was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and 
rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. <A name=C23V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And desiring to 
know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their 
council: <A name=C23V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whom I found to be accused about 
questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death 
or of bonds. <A name=C23V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was shown to me that there 
would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his 
accusers also to speak against him before thee. <A name=C23V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So the soldiers, 
as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. <A 
name=C23V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But on the morrow they left the 
horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: <A name=C23V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they, when 
they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul 
also before him. <A name=C23V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had read it, he asked of 
what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, <A 
name=C23V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will hear thee fully, said he, when 
thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace. 

<P>
<P><A name=C24V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after five days the high priest 
Ananias came down with certain elders, and <I>with</I> an orator, one Tertullus; 
and they informed the governor against Paul. <A name=C24V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was 
called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much 
peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation, <A 
name=C24V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>we 
accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all 
thankfulness. <A name=C24V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But, that I be not further tedious unto 
thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. <A name=C24V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we have found 
this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews 
throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: <A 
name=C24V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who moreover assayed to profane the 
temple: on whom also we laid hold: <I>and we would have judged him according to 
our law.</I> <A name=C24V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>But the chief captain Lysias came, 
and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</I> <A name=C24V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>commanding his 
accusers to come before thee.</I> from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him 
thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him. <A 
name=C24V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Jews also joined in the charge, 
affirming that these things were so. <A name=C24V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the governor had beckoned 
unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of 
many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense: <A 
name=C24V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing that thou canst take knowledge 
that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: <A 
name=C24V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and neither in the temple did they 
find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, 
nor in the city. <A name=C24V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither can they prove to thee the 
things whereof they now accuse me. <A name=C24V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this I confess unto thee, that 
after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, 
believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in 
the prophets; <A name=C24V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having hope toward God, which these 
also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just 
and unjust. <A name=C24V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Herein I also exercise myself to have 
a conscience void of offence toward God and men always. <A name=C24V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after some 
years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: <A name=C24V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>amidst which they 
found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but 
<I>there were</I> certain Jews from Asia-- <A name=C24V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who ought to have 
been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me. <A 
name=C24V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or else let these men themselves say 
what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council, <A 
name=C24V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>except it be for this one voice, that 
I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called 
in question before you this day. <A name=C24V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Felix, having more exact knowledge 
concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall 
come down, I will determine your matter. <A name=C24V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he gave order 
to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; 
and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him. <A name=C24V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But after certain 
days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, 
and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. <A name=C24V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he reasoned 
of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was 
terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient 
season, I will call thee unto me. <A name=C24V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He hoped withal that money would be 
given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with 
him. <A name=C24V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when two years were fulfilled, 
Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, 
Felix left Paul in bonds. 
<P>
<P><A name=C25V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Festus therefore, having come into the 
province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. <A 
name=C25V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief priests and the principal 
men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him, <A 
name=C25V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>asking a favor against him, that he 
would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way. <A 
name=C25V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was 
kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart 
<I>thither</I> shortly. <A name=C25V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let them therefore, saith he, that are 
of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, 
let them accuse him. <A name=C25V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had tarried among them not 
more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he 
sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. <A name=C25V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>25:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was 
come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing 
against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove; <A 
name=C25V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while Paul said in his defense, Neither 
against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I 
sinned at all. <A name=C25V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Festus, desiring to gain favor with 
the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be 
judged of these things before me? <A name=C25V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul said, I am standing before 
Caesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no 
wrong, as thou also very well knowest. <A name=C25V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If then I am a wrong-doer, and have 
committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those 
things is <I>true</I> whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. 
I appeal unto Caesar. <A name=C25V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Festus, when he had conferred 
with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt 
thou go. <A name=C25V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when certain days were passed, 
Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus. <A 
name=C25V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they tarried there many days, 
Festus laid Paul's case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a 
prisoner by Felix; <A name=C25V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, 
the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed <I>me</I>, asking for 
sentence against him. <A name=C25V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To whom I answered, that it is not the 
custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the 
accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning 
the matter laid against him. <A name=C25V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore they were come together 
here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and 
commanded the man to be brought. <A name=C25V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Concerning whom, when the accusers 
stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed; <A 
name=C25V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but had certain questions against him 
of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be 
alive. <A name=C25V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I, being perplexed how to inquire 
concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be 
judged of these matters. <A name=C25V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul had appealed to be kept 
for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send 
him to Caesar. <A name=C25V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Agrippa <I>said</I> unto Festus, I 
also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear 
him. <A name=C25V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So on the morrow, when Agrippa was 
come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of 
hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of 
Festus Paul was brought in. <A name=C25V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and 
all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the 
multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that 
he ought not to live any longer. <A name=C25V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I found that he had committed 
nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined 
to send him. <A name=C25V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Of whom I have no certain thing to 
write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially 
before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to 
write. <A name=C25V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>25:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in 
sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him. 
<P>
<P><A name=C26V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art 
permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his 
defence: <A name=C26V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, 
that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things 
whereof I am accused by the Jews: <A name=C26V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>especially because thou art expert in 
all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to 
hear me patiently. <A name=C26V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>My manner of life then from my youth 
up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know 
all the Jews; <A name=C26V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having knowledge of me from the first, 
if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I 
lived a Pharisee. <A name=C26V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now I stand <I>here</I> to be 
judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers; <A 
name=C26V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>unto which <I>promise</I> our twelve 
tribes, earnestly serving <I>God</I> night and day, hope to attain. And 
concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king! <A name=C26V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why is it judged 
incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead? <A name=C26V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I verily thought 
with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of 
Nazareth. <A name=C26V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this I also did in Jerusalem: and 
I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the 
chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them. <A 
name=C26V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And punishing them oftentimes in all 
the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad 
against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities. <A name=C26V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whereupon as I 
journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, <A 
name=C26V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>at midday, O king, I saw on the way a 
light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and 
them that journeyed with me. <A name=C26V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we were all fallen to the 
earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad. <A 
name=C26V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And 
the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. <A name=C26V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But arise, and 
stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee 
a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of 
the things wherein I will appear unto thee; <A name=C26V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>delivering thee 
from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, <A 
name=C26V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to open their eyes, that they may turn 
from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may 
receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by 
faith in me. <A name=C26V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not 
disobedient unto the heavenly vision: <A name=C26V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but declared both to them of Damascus 
first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to 
the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of 
repentance. <A name=C26V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause the Jews seized me in 
the temple, and assayed to kill me. <A name=C26V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having therefore obtained the help 
that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, 
saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come; <A 
name=C26V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how that the Christ must suffer, 
<I>and</I> how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim 
light both to the people and to the Gentiles. <A name=C26V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he thus 
made his defense, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much 
learning is turning thee mad. <A name=C26V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Paul saith, I am not mad, most 
excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness. <A 
name=C26V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the king knoweth of these things, 
unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is 
hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner. <A name=C26V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>King Agrippa, 
believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. <A name=C26V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Agrippa 
<I>said</I> unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a 
Christian. <A name=C26V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Paul <I>said</I>, I would to God, 
that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me 
this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds. <A name=C26V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the king rose 
up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: <A 
name=C26V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they had withdrawn, they 
spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of 
bonds. <A name=C26V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man 
might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar. 
<P>
<P><A name=C27V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was determined that we 
should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a 
centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band. <A name=C27V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And embarking in a 
ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of 
Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. 
<A name=C27V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the next day we touched at Sidon: 
and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and 
refresh himself. <A name=C27V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And putting to sea from thence, we 
sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. <A 
name=C27V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we had sailed across the sea 
which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <I>a city</I> of Lycia. <A 
name=C27V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there the centurion found a ship of 
Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein. <A name=C27V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we had 
sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the 
wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against 
Salmone; <A name=C27V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and with difficulty coasting along it 
we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of 
Lasea. <A name=C27V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when much time was spent, and the 
voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul 
admonished them, <A name=C27V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive 
that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and 
the ship, but also of our lives. <A name=C27V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the centurion gave more heed to 
the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken 
by Paul. <A name=C27V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And because the haven was not 
commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by 
any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter <I>there; which is</I> a haven of 
Crete, looking northeast and south-east. <A name=C27V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the south 
wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed 
anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore. <A name=C27V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But after no long 
time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo: <A 
name=C27V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when the ship was caught, and 
could not face the wind, we gave way <I>to it,</I> and were driven. <A 
name=C27V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And running under the lee of a small 
island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat: <A 
name=C27V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they had hoisted it up, they 
used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon 
the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven. <A name=C27V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as we labored 
exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the <I>the 
freight</I> overboard; <A name=C27V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the third day they cast out with 
their own hands the tackling of the ship. <A name=C27V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when neither 
sun nor stars shone upon <I>us</I> for many days, and no small tempest lay on 
<I>us,</I> all hope that we should be saved was now taken away. <A 
name=C27V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had been long without 
food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have 
hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury 
and loss. <A name=C27V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And now I exhort you to be of good 
cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but <I>only</I> of the 
ship. <A name=C27V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there stood by me this night an 
angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve, <A name=C27V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Fear not, 
Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that 
sail with thee. <A name=C27V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for 
I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me. <A 
name=C27V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we must be cast upon a certain 
island. <A name=C27V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the fourteenth night was 
come, as we were driven to and fro in the <I>sea of</I> Adria, about midnight 
the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country: <A 
name=C27V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they sounded, and found twenty 
fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen 
fathoms. <A name=C27V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And fearing lest haply we should be 
cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished 
for the day. <A name=C27V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as the sailors were seeking to 
flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as 
though they would lay out anchors from the foreship, <A name=C27V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul said to the 
centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be 
saved. <A name=C27V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes 
of the boat, and let her fall off. <A name=C27V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while the day was coming on, Paul 
besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that 
ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing. <A name=C27V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore I 
beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not 
a hair perish from the head of any of you. <A name=C27V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had 
said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; 
and he brake it, and began to eat. <A name=C27V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then were they all of good cheer, and 
themselves also took food. <A name=C27V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we were in all in the ship two 
hundred threescore and sixteen souls. <A name=C27V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had eaten enough, they 
lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. <A name=C27V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was 
day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and 
they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it. <A 
name=C27V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And casting off the anchors, they left 
them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting 
up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. <A name=C27V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But lighting upon 
a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck 
and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence <I>of 
the waves</I>. <A name=C27V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill 
the prisoners, lest any <I>of them</I> should swim out, and escape. <A 
name=C27V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the centurion, desiring to save 
Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim 
should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land; <A 
name=C27V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the rest, some on planks, and some 
on <I>other</I> things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all 
escaped safe to the land. 
<P>
<P><A name=C28V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we were escaped, then we knew 
that the island was called Melita. <A name=C28V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the barbarians showed us no common 
kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present 
rain, and because of the cold. <A name=C28V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of 
sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and 
fastened on his hand. <A name=C28V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the barbarians saw the 
<I>venomous</I> creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No 
doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet 
Justice hath not suffered to live. <A name=C28V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Howbeit he shook off the creature into 
the fire, and took no harm. <A name=C28V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they expected that he would have 
swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation 
and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he 
was a god. <A name=C28V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the neighborhood of that place 
were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received 
us, and entertained us three days courteously. <A name=C28V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was so, that 
the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered 
in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. <A name=C28V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when this was 
done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured: <A 
name=C28V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who also honored us with many honors; 
and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed. <A 
name=C28V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after three months we set sail in 
a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin 
Brothers. <A name=C28V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And touching at Syracuse, we tarried 
there three days. <A name=C28V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And from thence we made a circuit, and 
arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second 
day we came to Puteoli; <A name=C28V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>where we found brethren, and were 
entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome. <A 
name=C28V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And from thence the brethren, when 
they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three 
Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. <A 
name=C28V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when we entered into Rome, Paul 
was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him. <A 
name=C28V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that after three 
days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they 
were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing 
against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner 
from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: <A name=C28V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, when they had 
examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death 
in me. <A name=C28V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the Jews spake against it, I 
was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my 
nation. <A name=C28V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

you to see and to speak with <I>me</I>: for because of the hope of Israel I am 
bound with this chain. <A name=C28V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto him, We neither 
received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come 
hither and report or speak any harm of thee. <A name=C28V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we desire to 
hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us 
that everywhere it is spoken against. <A name=C28V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded <I>the 
matter,</I> testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, 
both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening. <A

were spoken, and some disbelieved. <A name=C28V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the 
Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, <A name=C28V26><FONT

<P>&nbsp;Go thou unto this people, and say,

<P>&nbsp;<A name=C28V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

gross, 
<P>&nbsp;And their ears are dull of hearing, 
<P>&nbsp;And their eyes they have closed; 
<P>&nbsp;Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, 
<P>&nbsp;And hear with their ears, 
<P>&nbsp;And understand with their heart, 
<P>&nbsp;And should turn again, 
<P>&nbsp;And I should heal them.

the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</I> <A
