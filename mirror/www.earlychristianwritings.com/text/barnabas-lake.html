<H1>Epistle of BARNABAS</H1>
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 1 
<P>Greeting and introduction -- Three doctrines-- Prophecy </H3>
<P>1 Hail, sons and daughters, in the name of the Lord who loved us, in peace. 
<P>2 Exceedingly and abundantly do I rejoice over your blessed and glorious 
spirit for the greatness and richness of God's ordinances towards you; so innate 
a grace of the gift of the spirit have you received. 
<P>3 Wherefore I congratulate myself the more in my hope of salvation, because I 
truly see in you that the Spirit has been poured out upon you from the Lord, who 
is rich in his bounty; so that the sight 
of you, for which I longed, amazed me. 
<P>4 Being persuaded then of this, and being conscious that since I spoke among 
you I have much understanding because the Lord has travelled with me in the way 
of righteousness, I am above all constrained to this, to love you above my own 
life, because great faith and love dwell in you in the "hope of his life." 
<P>5 I have therefore reckoned that, if I make it my care in your behalf to 
communicate somewhat of that which I received, it shall bring me the reward of 
having ministered to such spirits, and I hasten to send you a short letter in 
order that your knowledge may be perfected along with your faith. 
<P>6 There are then three doctrines of the Lord: "the 
hope of life" is the beginning and end of our faith; and righteousness is the 
beginning and end of judgment; love of joy and of gladness is the testimony of 
the works of righteousness. 
<P>7 For the Lord made known to us through the prophets things past and things 
present and has given us the firstfruits of the taste of things to come; and 
when we see these things coming to pass one by one, as he said, we ought to make 
a richer and deeper offering for fear of him. 
<P>8 But I will show you a few things, not as a teacher but as one of 
yourselves, in which you shall rejoice at this present time. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 2 
<P>The need of virtue -- The abolition of Jewish sacrifices </H3>
<P>1 Seeing then that the days are evil, and that the worker of evil himself is 
in power, we ought to give heed to ourselves, and seek out the ordinances of the 
Lord. 
<P>2 Fear then, and patience are the helpers of our faith, and long-suffering 
and continence are our allies. 
<P>3 While then these things remain in holiness towards the Lord, wisdom, 
prudence, understanding, and knowledge rejoice with them. 
<P>4 For he has made plain to us through all the Prophets that he needs neither 
sacrifices nor burnt-offerings nor oblations, saying in one place, 
<P>5 "What is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord. I am 
full of burnt offerings and desire not the fat of lambs and the blood of bulls 
and goats, not even when ye come to appear before me. For who has required these 
things at your hands? Henceforth shall ye tread my court no more. If ye bring 
flour, it is vain. Incense is an abomination to me. I cannot away with your new 
moons and sabbaths." 
<P>6 These things then he abolished in order that the new law of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, which is without the yoke of necessity, might have its oblation not made 
by man. 
<P>7 And again he says to them, "Did I command your fathers when they came out 
of the land of Egypt to offer me burnt offerings and sacrifices? 
<P>8 Nay, but rather did I command them this: Let none of you cherish any evil 
in his heart against his neighbour, and love not a false oath." 
<P>9 We ought then to understand, if we are not foolish, the loving intention of 
our Father, for he speaks to us, wishing that we should not err like them, but 
seek how we may make our offering to him. 
<P>10 To us then he speaks thus: "Sacrifice for the Lord is a broken heart, a 
smell of sweet savour to the Lord is a heart that glorifieth him that made 
it." We 
ought, therefore, brethren, carefully to enquire concerning our salvation, in 
order that the evil one may not achieve a deceitful entry into us and hurl us 
away from our life. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 3 
<P>Concerning fasting </H3>
<P>1 To them he says then again concerning these things, "Why do ye fast for me, 
saith the Lord, so that your voice is heard this day with a cry! This is not the 
fast which I chose, saith the Lord, not a man humbling his soul; 
<P>2 nor though ye bend your neck as a hoop, and put on sackcloth, and make your 
bed of ashes, not even so shall ye call it an acceptable fast." 
<P>3 But to us he says, "Behold this is the fast which I chose," saith the Lord, 
"loose every bond of wickedness, set loose the fastenings of harsh agreements, 
send away the bruised in forgiveness, and tear up every unjust contract, give to 
the hungry thy bread, and if thou seest a naked man clothe him, bring the 
homeless into thy house, and if thou seest a humble man, despise him not, 
neither thou nor any of the household of thy seed. 
<P>4 Then shall thy light break forth as the dawn, and thy robes shall rise 
quickly, and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall 
surround thee." 
<P>5 "Then thou shalt cry and God shall hear thee; while thou art still speaking 
He shall say, `Lo I am here'; if thou puttest away from thee bondage, and 
violence, and the word of murmuring, and dost give to the poor thy bread with a 
cheerful heart, and dost pity the soul that is abased." 
<P>6 So then, brethren, the long-suffering one foresaw that the people whom He 
prepared in his beloved should believe in guilelessness, and made all things 
plain to us beforehand that we should not be shipwrecked by conversion to their 
law. 
<P>
<HR>

<H4>CHAPTER 4 
<P>Warning that the final trial is at hand -- The covenant. Christian or Jewish? 
-- Admonition to stedfastness </H4>
<P>1 We ought, then, to enquire earnestly into the things which now are, and to 
seek out those which are able to save us. Let us then utterly flee from all the 
works of lawlessness, lest the works of lawlessness overcome us, and let us hate 
the error of this present time, that we may be loved in that which is to come. 
<P>2 Let us give no freedom to our souls to have power to walk with sinners and 
wicked men, lest we be made like to them. 
<P>3 The final stumbling block is at hand of which it was written, as Enoch 
says, "For to this end the Lord has cut short the times and the days, that his 
beloved should make haste and come to his inheritance." 
<P>4 And the Prophet also says thus: "Ten kingdoms shall reign upon the earth 
and there shall rise up after them a little king, who shall subdue three of the 
kings under one." 
<P>5 Daniel says likewise concerning the same: "And I beheld the fourth Beast, 
wicked and powerful and fiercer than all the beasts of the sea, and that ten 
horns sprang from it, and out of them a little excrescent horn, and that it 
subdued under one three of the great horns." 
<P>6 You ought then to understand. And this also I ask you, as being one of 
yourselves, and especially as loving you all above my own life; take heed to 
yourselves now, and be not made like unto some, heaping up your sins and saying 
that the covenant is both theirs and ours. 
<P>7 It is ours: but in this way did they finally lose it when Moses had just 
received it, for the Scripture says: "And Moses was in the mount fasting forty 
days and forty nights, and he received the covenant from the Lord, tables of 
stone written with the finger of the hand of the Lord." 
<P>8 But they turned to idols and lost it. For thus saith the Lord: "Moses, 
Moses, go down quickly, for thy people, whom thou broughtest forth out of the 
land of Egypt, have broken the Law." And Moses understood and cast the two 
tables out of his hands, and their covenant was broken, in order that the 
covenant of Jesus the Beloved should be sealed in our hearts in hope of his 
faith. 
<P>9 (And though I wish to write much, I hasten to write in devotion to you, not 
as a teacher, but as it becomes one who loves to leave out nothing of that which 
we have.) 
Wherefore let us pay heed in the last days, for the whole time of our life and 
faith will profit us nothing, unless we resist, as becomes the sons of God in 
this present evil time, against the offences which are to come, that the Black 
One may have no opportunity of entry. 
<P>10 Let us flee from all vanity, let us utterly hate the deeds of the path of 
wickedness. Do not by retiring apart live alone as if you were already made 
righteous, but come together and seek out the common good. 
<P>11 For the Scripture says: "Woe to them who are prudent for themselves and 
understanding in their own sight." Let us be spiritual, let us be a temple 
consecrated to God, so far as in us lies let us "exercise ourselves in the fear" 
of God, and let us strive to keep his commandments in order that we may rejoice 
in his ordinances. 
<P>12 The Lord will "judge" the world "without respect of persons." Each will 
receive according to his deeds. If he be good his righteousness will lead him; 
if he be evil the reward of iniquity is before him. 
<P>13 Let us never rest as though we were `called' and slumber in our 
sins, lest the wicked ruler gain power over us and thrust us out from the 
Kingdom of the Lord. 
<P>14 And consider this also, my brethren, when you see that after such great 
signs and wonders were wrought in Israel they were even then finally abandoned; 
-- let us take heed lest as it was written we be found "many called but few 
chosen." 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 5 
<P>The reason for the Passion of Christ </H3>
<P>1 For it was for this reason that the Lord endured to deliver up his flesh to 
corruption, that we should be sanctified by the remission of sin, that is, by 
his sprinkled blood. 
<P>2 For the scripture concerning him relates partly to Israel, partly to us, 
and it speaks thus: "He was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our 
iniquities, by his stripes we were healed. He was brought as a sheep to the 
slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before its shearer." 
<P>3 Therefore we ought to give great thanks to the Lord that he has given us 
knowledge of the past, and wisdom for the present, and that we are not without 
understanding for the future. 
<P>4 And the Scripture says, "Not unjustly are the nets spread out for the 
birds." This means that a man deserves to perish who has a knowledge of the way 
of righteousness, but turns aside into the way of darkness. 
<P>5 Moreover, my brethren, if the Lord endured to suffer for our life, though 
he is the Lord of all the world, to whom God said before the foundation of the 
world, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," how, then, did he endure to 
suffer at the hand of man? 
<P>6 Learn: -- The Prophets who received grace from him prophesied of him, and 
he, in order that he "might destroy death," and show forth the Resurrection from 
the dead, because he needs must be made "manifest in the flesh," endured 
<P>7 in order to fulfil the promise made to the fathers, and himself prepare for 
himself the new people and show while he was on earth that he himself will raise 
the dead and judge the risen. 
<P>8 Furthermore, while teaching Israel and doing such great signs and wonders 
he preached to them and loved them greatly; 
<P>9 but when he chose out his own Apostles who were to preach his Gospel, he 
chose those who were iniquitous above all sin to show that "he came not to call 
the righteous but sinners," -- then he manifested himself as God's Son. 
<P>10 For if he had not come in the flesh men could in no way have been saved by 
beholding him; seeing that they have not the power when they look at the sun to 
gaze straight at its rays, though it is destined to perish, and is the work of 
his hands. 
<P>11 So then the Son of God came in the flesh for this reason, that he might 
complete the total of the sins of those who persecuted his prophets to death. 
<P>12 For this cause he endured. For God says of the chastisement of his flesh 
that it is from them: "When they shall smite their shepherd, then the sheep of 
the flock shall be destroyed." 
<P>13 And he was willing to suffer thus, for it was necessary that he should 
suffer on a tree, for the Prophet says of him, "Spare my soul from the sword" 
and, "Nail my flesh, for the synagogues of the wicked have risen against me." 
<P>14 And again he says: "Lo, I have given my back to scourges, and my cheeks to 
strokes, and I have set my face as a solid rock." 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 6 
<P>Proofs from the Prophets </H3>
<P>1 When therefore he made the commandment what does he say? "Who is he that 
comes into court with me? Let him oppose me; or, who is he that seeks justice 
against me? Let him draw near to the Lord's servant. 
<P>2 Woe unto you, for ye shall all wax old as a garment and the moth shall eat 
you up." And again the Prophet says that he was placed as a strong stone for 
crushing, "Lo, I will place for the foundations of Sion a precious stone, chosen 
out, a chief corner stone, honourable." 
<P>3 Then what does he say? "And he that hopeth on it shall live for ever." Is 
then our hope on a stone? God forbid. But he means that the Lord placed His 
flesh in strength. For he says, "And he placed me as a solid rock." 
<P>4 And again the Prophet says, "The stone which the builders rejected, this is 
become the head of the corner," and again he says, "This is the great and 
wonderful day which the Lord made." 
<P>5 I write to you more simply that you may understand: I am devoted to your 
love. 
<P>6 What then does the Prophet say again? "The synagogue of the sinners 
compassed me around, they surrounded me as bees round the honeycomb" and, "They 
cast lots for my clothing." 
<P>7 Since therefore he was destined to be manifest and to suffer in the flesh 
his Passion was foretold. For the Prophet says concerning Israel, "Woe unto 
their soul, for they have plotted an evil plot against themselves, saying, `Let 
us bind the Just one, for he is unprofitable to us.'" 
<P>8 What does the other Prophet, Moses, say to them? "Lo, thus saith the Lord 
God, enter into the good land which the Lord sware that he would give to 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and inherit it, a land flowing with milk and honey." 
<P>9 But learn what knowledge says. Hope, it says, on that Jesus who will be 
manifested to you in the flesh. For man is earth which suffers, for the creation 
of Adam was from the face of the earth. 
<P>10 What then is the meaning of "into the good land, a land flowing with milk 
and honey"? Blessed be our Lord, brethren, who has placed in us wisdom and 
understanding of his secrets. For the prophet speaks a parable of the Lord: "Who 
shall understand save he who is wise, and learned, and a lover of his Lord?" 
<P>11 Since then he made us new by the remission of sins he made us another 
type, that we should have the soul of children, as though he were creating us 
afresh. 
<P>12 For it is concerning us that the scripture says that he says to the Son, 
"Let us make man after our image and likeness, and let them rule the beasts of 
the earth, and the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea." And the Lord 
said, when he saw our fair creation, "Increase and multiply and fill the earth"; 
these things were spoken to the Son. 
<P>13 Again I will show you how he speaks to us. In the last days he made a 
second creation; and the Lord says, "See, I make the last things as the first." 
To this then the Prophet referred when he proclaimed, "Enter into a land flowing 
with milk and honey, and rule over it." 
<P>14 See then, we have been created afresh, as he says again in another 
Prophet, "See," saith the Lord, "I will take out from them" (that is those whom 
the Spirit of the Lord foresaw) "the hearts of stone and I will put in hearts of 
flesh." Because he himself was going to be manifest in the flesh and to dwell 
among us. 
<P>15 For, my brethren, the habitation of our hearts is a shrine holy to the 
Lord. 
<P>16 For the Lord says again, "And wherewith shall I appear before the Lord my 
God and be glorified?" He says, "I will confess to thee in the assembly of my 
brethren, and will sing to thee in the midst of the assembly of saints." We then 
are they whom he brought into the good land. 
<P>17 What then is the milk and the honey? Because a child is first nourished 
with honey, and afterwards with milk. Thus therefore we also, being nourished on 
the faith of the promise and by the word, shall live and possess the earth. 
<P>18 And we have said above, "And let them increase and multiply and rule over 
the fishes." Who then is it who is now able to rule over beasts or fishes or the 
birds of heaven? For we ought to understand that to rule implies authority, so 
that one may give commandments and have domination. 
<P>19 If then this does not happen at present he has told us the time when it 
will; -- when we ourselves also have been made perfect as heirs of the covenant 
of the Lord. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 7 
<P>Fasting and the scapegoat </H3>
<P>1 Understand therefore, children of gladness, that the good Lord made all 
things plain beforehand to us, that we should know him to whom we ought to give 
thanks and praise for everything. 
<P>2 If then the Son of God, though he was the Lord and was "destined to judge 
the living and the dead" suffered in order that his wounding might make us 
alive, let us believe that the Son of God could not suffer except for our sakes. 

<P>3 But moreover when he was crucified "he was given to drink vinegar and 
gall." Listen how the priests of the Temple foretold this. The commandment was 
written, "Whosoever does not keep the fast shall die the death," and the Lord 
commanded this because he himself was going to offer the vessel of the spirit as 
a sacrifice for our sins, in order that the type established in Isaac, who was 
offered upon the altar, might be fulfilled. 
<P>4 What then does he say in the Prophet? "And let them eat of the goat which 
is offered in the fast for all their sins." Attend carefully, -- "and let all 
the priests alone eat the entrails unwashed with vinegar." 
<P>5 Why? Because you are going "to give to me gall and vinegar to drink" when I 
am on the point of offering my flesh for my new people, therefore you alone 
shall eat, while the people fast and mourn in sackcloth and ashes, to show that 
he must suffer for them. 
<P>6 Note what was commanded: "Take two goats, goodly and alike, and offer them, 
and let the priest take the one as a burnt offering for sins." 
<P>7 But what are they to do with the other? "The other," he says, "is 
accursed." Notice how the type of Jesus is manifested: 
<P>8 "And do ye all spit on it, and goad it, and bind the scarlet wool about its 
head, and so let it be cast into the desert." And when it is so done, he who 
takes the goat into the wilderness drives it forth, and takes away the wool, and 
puts it upon a shrub which is called Rachel, of which we are 
accustomed to eat the shoots when we find them in the country: thus of Rachel 
alone is the fruit sweet. 
<P>9 What does this mean? Listen: "the first goat is for the altar, but the 
other is accursed," and note that the one that is accursed is crowned, because 
then "they will see him" on that day with the long scarlet robe "down to the 
feet" on his body, and they will say, "Is not this he whom we once crucified and 
rejected and pierced and spat upon? Of a truth it was he who then said that he 
was the Son of God." 
<P>10 But how is he like to the goat? For this reason: "the goats shall be 
alike, beautiful, and a pair," in order that when they see him come at that time 
they may be astonished at the likeness of the goat. See then the type of Jesus 
destined to suffer. 
<P>11 But why is it that they put the wool in the middle of the thorns? It is a 
type of Jesus placed in the Church, because whoever wishes to take away the 
scarlet wool must suffer much because the thorns are terrible and he can gain it 
only through pain. Thus he says, "those who will see me, and attain to my 
kingdom must lay hold of me through pain and suffering." 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 8 
<P>The sacrifice of a heifer </H3>
<P>1 But what do you think that it typifies, that the commandment has been given 
to Israel that the men in whom sin is complete offer a heifer and slay it and 
burn it, and that boys then take the ashes and put them into vessels and bind 
scarlet wool on sticks (see again the type of the Cross and the scarlet wool) 
and hyssop, and that the boys all sprinkle the people thus one by one in order 
that they all be purified from their sins? 
<P>2 Observe how plainly he speaks to you. The calf is Jesus; the sinful men 
offering it are those who brought him to be slain. Then there are no longer men, 
no longer the glory of 
sinners. 
<P>3 The boys who sprinkle are they who preached to us the forgiveness of sins, 
and the purification of the heart, to whom he gave the power of the Gospel to 
preach, and there are twelve as a testimony to the tribes, because there are 
twelve tribes of Israel. 
<P>4 But why are there three boys who sprinkle? As a testimony to Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, for these are great before God. 
<P>5 And why was the wool put on the wood? Because the kingdom of Jesus is on 
the wood, 
and because those who hope on him shall live for ever. 
<P>6 But why are the wool and the hyssop together? Because in his kingdom there 
shall be evil and foul days, in which we shall be saved, for he also who has 
pain in his flesh is cured by the foulness of the hyssop. 
<P>7 And for this reason the things which were thus done are plain to us, but 
obscure to them, because they did not hear the Lord's voice. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 9 
<P>The circumcision </H3>
<P>1 For he speaks again concerning the ears, how he circumcised our hearts; for 
the Lord says in the Prophet: "In the hearing of the ear they obey me." And 
again he says, "They who are afar off shall hear clearly, they shall know the 
things that I have done," and "Circumcise your hearts, saith the Lord." 
<P>2 And again he says, "Hear, O Israel, thus saith the Lord thy God," and again 
the Spirit of the Lord prophesies, "Who is he that will live for ever? Let him 
hear the voice of my servant." 
<P>3 And again he says, "Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord 
hath spoken these things for a testimony." And again he says, "Hear the word of 
the Lord, ye rulers of this people." And again he says, "Hear, O children, a 
voice of one crying in the wilderness." So then he circumcised our hearing in 
order that we should hear the word and believe. 
<P>4 But moreover the circumcision in which they trusted has been abolished. For 
he declared that circumcision was not of the flesh, but they erred because an 
evil angel was misleading them. 
<P>5 He says to them, "Thus saith the Lord your God" (here I find a 
commandment), "Sow not among thorns, be circumcised to your Lord." And what does 
he say? "Circumcise the hardness of your heart, and stiffen not your neck." Take 
it again: "Behold, saith the Lord, all the heathen are uncircumcised in the 
foreskin, but this people is uncircumcised in heart." 
<P>6 But you will say, surely the people has received circumcision as a seal? 
Yes, but every Syrian and Arab and all priests of the idols have been 
circumcised; are then these also within their covenant? -- 
indeed even the Egyptians belong to the circumcision. 
<P>7 Learn fully then, children of love, concerning all things, for Abraham, who 
first circumcised, did so looking forward in the spirit to Jesus, and had 
received the doctrines of three letters. 
<P>8 For it says, "And Abraham circumcised from his household eighteen men and 
three hundred." What then was 
the knowledge that was given to him? Notice that he first mentions the eighteen, 
and after a pause the three hundred. The eighteen is I (=ten) and H (=8) -- you 
have Jesus -- and because 
the cross was destined to have grace in the T he says "and three 
hundred." 
So he indicates Jesus in the two letters and the cross in the other. 
<P>9 He knows this who placed the gift of his teaching in our hearts. No one has 
heard a more excellent lesson from me, but I know that you are worthy. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 10 
<P>The Food-law of the Jews -- The explanation in the Psalter </H3>
<P>1 Now, in that Moses said, "Ye shall not eat swine, nor an eagle, nor a hawk, 
nor a crow, nor any fish which has no scales on itself," he included three 
doctrines in his understanding. 
<P>2 Moreover he says to them in Deuteronomy, "And I will make a covenant of my 
ordinances with this people." So then the ordinance of God is not abstinence 
from eating, but Moses spoke in the spirit. 
<P>3 He mentioned the swine for this reason: you shall not consort, he means, 
with men who are like swine, that is to say, when they have plenty they forget 
the Lord, but when they are in want they recognise the Lord, just as the swine 
when it eats does not know its master, but when it is hungry it cries out, and 
after receiving food is again silent. 
<P>4 "Neither shalt thou eat the eagle nor the hawk nor the kite nor the crow." 
Thou shalt not, he means, join thyself or make thyself like to such men, as do 
not know how to gain their food by their labour and sweat, but plunder other 
people's property in their iniquity, and lay wait for it, though they seem to 
walk in innocence, and look round to see whom they may plunder in their 
covetousness, just as these birds alone provide no food for themselves, but sit 
idle, and seek how they may devour the flesh of others, and become pestilent in 
their iniquity. 
<P>5 "Thou shalt not eat," he says, "the lamprey nor the polypus nor the 
cuttlefish." Thou shalt not, he means, consort with or become like such men who 
are utterly ungodly and who are already condemned to death, just as these fish 
alone are accursed, and float in the deep water, not swimming like the others 
but living on the ground at the bottom of the sea. 
<P>6 Sed 
nec "leporem manducabis." Non eris, inquit, corruptor puerorum nec similabis 
talibus. Quia lepus singulis annis facit ad adsellandum singula foramina; et 
quotquot annis vivit, totidem foramina facit. 
<P>7 Sed "nec beluam, inquit, manducabis"; hoc est non eris 
moecus aut adulter, nec corruptor, nec similabis talibus. Quia haec bestia 
alternis annis mutat naturam et fit modo masculus, modo femina. 
<P>8 Sed et quod dicit mustelam odibis. Non eris, inquit, talis, qui audit 
iniquitatem et loquitur immunditiam. Non inquit adhaerebis immundis qui 
iniquitatem faciunt ore suo. 
<P>9 Moses received three doctrines concerning food and thus spoke of them in 
the Spirit; but they received them as really referring to food, owing to the 
lust of their flesh. 
<P>10 But David received knowledge concerning the same three doctrines, and 
says: "Blessed is the man who has not gone in the counsel of the ungodly" as the 
fishes go in darkness in the deep waters, "and has not stood in the way of 
sinners" like those who seem to fear the Lord, but sin like the swine, "and has 
not sat in the seat of the scorners" like the birds who sit and wait for their 
prey. Grasp fully the doctrines concerning food. 
<P>11 Moses says again, "Eat of every animal that is cloven hoofed and 
ruminant." What does he mean? That he who receives food knows him who feeds him, 
and rests on him and seems to rejoice. Well did he speak with regard to the 
commandment. What then does he mean? Consort with those who fear the Lord, with 
those who meditate in their heart on the meaning of the word which they have 
received, with those who speak of and observe the ordinances of the Lord, with 
those who know that meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate on the 
word of the Lord. But what does "the cloven hoofed" mean? That the righteous 
both walks in this world and looks forward to the holy age. See how well Moses 
legislated. 
<P>12 But how was it possible for them to understand or comprehend these things? 
But we having a righteous understanding of them announce the commandments as the 
Lord wished. For this cause he circumcised our hearing and our hearts that we 
should comprehend these things. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 11 
<P>Baptism -- The Cross </H3>
<P>1 But let us enquire if the Lord took pains to foretell the water of baptism 
and the cross. Concerning the water it has been written with regard to Israel 
that they will not receive the baptism that brings the remission of sins, but 
will build for themselves. 
<P>2 For the Prophet says, "Be astonished O heaven, and let the earth tremble 
the more at this, that this people hath committed two evils: they have deserted 
me, the spring of life, and they have dug for themselves a cistern of death. 
<P>3 Is my holy mountain Sinai a desert rock? For ye shall be as the fledgling 
birds, fluttering about when they are taken away from the nest." 
<P>4 And again the Prophet says, "I will go before you and I will make mountains 
level, and I will break gates of brass, and I will shatter bars of iron, and I 
will give thee treasures of darkness, secret, invisible, that they may know that 
I am the Lord God." 
<P>5 And, "Thou shalt dwell in a lofty cave of a strong rock." And, "His water 
is sure, ye shall see the King in his glory, and your soul shall meditate on the 
fear of the Lord." 
<P>6 And again he says in another Prophet, "And he who does these things shall 
be as the tree, which is planted at the partings of the waters, which shall give 
its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fade, and all things, whatsoever 
he doeth, shall prosper. 
<P>7 It is not so with the wicked, it is not so; but they are even as the chaff 
which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth. Therefore the wicked 
shall not rise up in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous, for 
the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly shall 
perish." 
<P>8 Mark how he described the water and the cross together. For he means this: 
blessed are those who hoped on the cross, and descended into the water. For he 
speaks of their reward "in his season"; at that time, he says, I will repay. But 
now when he says, "Their leaves shall not fade," he means that every word which 
shall come forth from your mouth in faith and love, shall be for conversion and 
hope for many. 
<P>9 And again another Prophet says, "And the land of Jacob was praised above 
every land." He means to say that he is glorifying the vessel of his Spirit. 
<P>10 What does he say next? "And there was a river flowing on the right hand, 
and beautiful trees grew out of it, and whosoever shall eat of them shall live 
for ever." 
<P>11 He means to say that we go down into the water full of sins and foulness, 
and we come up bearing the fruit of fear in our hearts, and having hope on Jesus 
in the Spirit. "And whosoever shall eat of them shall live for ever." He means 
that whosoever hears and believes these things spoken shall live for ever. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 12 
<P>The Cross -- Joshua </H3>
<P>1 Similarly, again, he describes the cross in another Prophet, who says, "And 
when shall all these things be accomplished? saith the Lord. When the tree shall 
fall and rise, and when blood shall flow from the tree." Here again you have a 
reference to the cross, and to him who should he crucified. 
<P>2 And he says again to Moses, when Israel was warred upon by strangers, and 
in order to remind those who were warred upon that they were delivered unto 
death by reason of their sins -- the Spirit speaks to the heart of Moses to make 
a representation of the cross, and of him who should suffer, because, he says, 
unless they put their trust in him, they shall suffer war for ever. Moses 
therefore placed one shield upon another in the midst of the fight, and standing 
there raised above them all kept stretching out his hands, and so Israel again 
began to be victorious: then, whenever he let them drop they began to perish. 
<P>3 Why? That they may know that they cannot be saved if they do not hope on 
him. 
<P>4 And again he says in another Prophet, "I stretched out my hands the whole 
day to a disobedient people and one that refuses my righteous way." 
<P>5 Again Moses makes a representation of Jesus, showing that he must suffer, 
and shall himself give life, though they will believe that he has been put to 
death, by the sign given when Israel was falling (for the Lord made every 
serpent bite them, and they were perishing, for the fall took place in 
Eve through the serpent), in order to convince them that they will be delivered 
over to the affliction of death because of their transgression. 
<P>6 Moreover, though Moses commanded them: -- "You shall have neither graven 
nor molten image for your God," yet he makes one himself to show a type of 
Jesus. Moses therefore makes a graven serpent, and places it in honour and calls 
the people by a proclamation. 
<P>7 So they came together and besought Moses that he would offer prayer on 
their behalf for their healing. But Moses said to them, "Whenever one of you," 
he said, "be bitten, let him come to the serpent that is placed upon the tree, 
and let him hope, in faith that it though dead is able to give life, and he 
shall straightway be saved." And they did so. In this also you have again the 
glory of Jesus, for all things are in him and for him. 
<P>8 Again, why does Moses say to Jesus, the son of Naue, when he gives 
him, prophet as he is, this name, that the whole people should listen to him 
alone? Because the Father was revealing everything concerning his Son Jesus. 
<P>9 Moses therefore says to Jesus the son of Naue, after giving him this name, 
when he sent him to spy out the land, "Take a book in thy hands and write what 
the Lord saith, that the Son of God shall in the last day tear up by the roots 
the whole house of Amalek." 
<P>10 See again Jesus, not as son of man, but as Son of God, but manifested in a 
type in the flesh. Since therefore they are going to say that the Christ is 
David's son, David himself prophesies, fearing and understanding the error of 
the sinners, "The Lord said to my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make 
thy enemies thy footstool." 
<P>11 And again Isaiah speaks thus, "The Lord said to Christ my Lord, whose 
right hand I held, that the nations should obey before him, and I will shatter 
the strength of Kings." See how "David calls him Lord" and does not say Son. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 13 
<P>Jews and Christians as heirs of the covenant </H3>
<P>1 Now let us see whether this people or the former people is the heir, and 
whether the covenant is for us or for them. 
<P>2 Hear then what the Scripture says concerning the people: "And Isaac prayed 
concerning Rebecca his wife, because she was barren, and she conceived. Then 
Rebecca went forth to enquire of the Lord and the Lord said to her: two nations 
are in thy womb, and two peoples in thy belly, and one people shall overcome a 
people, and the greater shall serve the less." 
<P>3 You ought to understand who is Isaac and who is Rebecca, and of whom he has 
shown that this people is greater than that people. 
<P>4 And in another prophecy Jacob speaks more plainly to Joseph his son, 
saying, "Behold the Lord hath not deprived me of thy presence; bring me thy 
sons, that I may bless them." 
<P>5 And he brought Ephraim and Manasses, and wished that Manasses should be 
blessed, because he was the elder; for Joseph brought him to the right hand of 
his father Jacob. But Jacob saw in the spirit a type of the people of the 
future. And what does he say? "And Jacob crossed his hands, and placed his right 
hand on the head of Ephraim, the second and younger son, and blessed him; and 
Joseph said to Jacob, Change thy right hand on to the head of Manasses, for he 
is my first-born son. And Jacob said to Joseph, I know it, my child, I know it; 
but the greater shall serve the less, and this one shall indeed be blessed." 
<P>6 See who it is of whom he ordained that this people is the first and heir of 
the covenant. 
<P>7 If then besides this he remembered it also in the case of Abraham, we reach 
the perfection of our knowledge. What then does he say to Abraham, when he alone 
was faithful, and it was counted him for righteousness? "Behold I have made 
thee, Abraham, the father of the Gentiles who believe in God in uncircumcision." 

<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 14 
<P>The fulfilment of the promise to the Jews </H3>
<P>1 So it is. But let us see whether the covenant which he sware to the fathers 
to give to the people -- whether he has given it. He has given it. But they were 
not worthy to receive it because of their sins. 
<P>2 For the Prophet says, "And Moses was fasting on Mount Sinai, to receive the 
covenant of the Lord for the people, forty days and forty nights. And Moses 
received from the Lord the two tables, written by the finger of the hand of the 
Lord in the Spirit"; and Moses took them, and carried them down to give them to 
the people. 
<P>3 And the Lord said to Moses, "Moses, Moses, go down quickly, for thy people 
whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt have broken the Law. And Moses 
perceived that they had made themselves again molten images, and he cast them 
out of his hands, and the tables of the covenant of the Lord were broken." 
<P>4 Moses received it, but they were not worthy. But learn how we received it. 
Moses received it when he was a servant, but the Lord himself gave it to us, as 
the people of the inheritance, by suffering for our sakes. 
<P>5 And it was made manifest both that the tale of their sins should be 
completed in their sins, and that we through Jesus, the Lord who inherits the 
covenant, should receive it, for he was prepared for this purpose, that when he 
appeared he might redeem from darkness our hearts which were already paid over 
to death, and given over to the iniquity of error, and by his word might make a 
covenant with us. 
<P>6 For it is written that the Father enjoins on him that he should redeem us 
from darkness and prepare a holy people for himself. 
<P>7 The Prophet therefore says, "I the Lord thy God did call thee in 
righteousness, and I will hold thy hands, and I will give thee strength, and I 
have given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light to the Gentiles, to 
open the eyes of the blind, and to bring forth from their fetters those that are 
bound and those that sit in darkness out of the prison house." We know then 
whence we have been redeemed. 
<P>8 Again the Prophet says, "Lo, I have made thee a light for the Gentiles, to 
be for salvation unto the ends of the earth, thus saith the Lord the God who did 
redeem thee." 
<P>9 And again the Prophet saith, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he 
anointed me to preach the Gospel of grace to the humble, he sent me to heal the 
brokenhearted, to proclaim delivery to the captives, and sight to the blind, to 
announce a year acceptable to the Lord, and a day of recompense, to comfort all 
who mourn." 
<H3>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 15 
<P>The Sabbath </H3>
<P>1 Furthermore it was written concerning theSabbath in the ten words which he 
spake on Mount Sinaiface to face to Moses. "Sanctify also the Sabbath ofthe Lord 
with pure hands and a pure heart." 
<P>2 And in another place he says, "If my sons keepthe Sabbath, then will I 
bestow my mercy upon them." 
<P>3 He speaks of the Sabbath at the beginning ofthe Creation, "And God made in 
six days the works ofhis hands and on the seventh day he made an end, andrested 
in it and sanctified it." 
<P>4 Notice, children, what is the meaning of "Hemade an end in six days"? He 
means this: that the Lordwill make an end of everything in six thousand 
years,for a day with him means a thousand years. And hehimself is my witness 
when he says, "Lo, the day ofthe Lord shall be as a thousand years." So 
then,children, in six days, that is in six thousand years,everything will be 
completed. 
<P>5 "And he rested on the seventh day." This means,when his Son comes he will 
destroy the time of thewicked one, and will judge the godless, and willchange 
the sun and the moon and the stars, and then hewill truly rest on the seventh 
day. 
<P>6 Furthermore he says, "Thou shalt sanctify itwith clean hands and a pure 
heart." If, then, anyonehas at present the power to keep holy the day whichGod 
made holy, by being pure in heart, we arealtogether deceived. 
<P>7 See that we shall indeed keep it holy at thattime, when we enjoy true rest, 
when we shall be ableto do so because we have been made righteous ourselvesand 
have received the promise, when there is no moresin, but all things have been 
made new by the Lord:then we shall be able to keep it holy because weourselves 
have first been made holy. 
<P>8 Furthermore he says to them, "Your new moonsand the sabbaths I cannot away 
with." Do you see whathe means? The present sabbaths are not acceptable tome, 
but that which I have made, in which I will giverest to all things and make the 
beginning of an eighthday, that is the beginning of another world. 
<P>9 Wherefore we also celebrate with gladness theeighth day in which Jesus also 
rose from the dead, andwas made manifest, and ascended into Heaven. 
<H3>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 16 
<P>The Temple </H3>
<P>1 I will also speak with you concerning the Temple, and show how the wretched 
men erred by putting their hope on the building, and not on the God who made 
them, and is the true house of God. 
<P>2 For they consecrated him in the Temple almost like the heathen. But learn 
how the Lord speaks, in bringing it to naught, "Who has measured the heaven with 
a span, or the earth with his outstretched hand? Have not I? saith the Lord. 
Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool, what house will ye build for 
me, or what is the place of my rest?" You know that their hope was vain. 
<P>3 Furthermore he says again, "Lo, they who destroyed this temple shall 
themselves build it." 
<P>4 That is happening now. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; 
at present even the servants of the enemy will build it up again. 
<P>5 Again, it was made manifest that the city and the temple and the people of 
Israel were to be delivered up. For the Scripture says, "And it shall come to 
pass in the last days that the Lord shall deliver the sheep of his pasture, and 
the sheep-fold, and their tower to destruction." And it took place according to 
what the Lord said. 
<P>6 But let us inquire if a temple of God exists. Yes, it exists, where he 
himself said that he makes and perfects it. For it is written, "And it shall 
come to pass when the week is ended that a temple of God shall be built 
gloriously in the name of the Lord." 
<P>7 I find then that a temple exists. Learn then how it will be built in the 
name of the Lord. Before we believed in God the habitation of our heart was 
corrupt and weak, like a temple really built with hands, because it was full of 
idolatry, and was the house of demons through doing things which were contrary 
to God. 
<P>8 "But it shall be built in the name of the Lord." Now give heed, in order 
that the temple of the Lord may be built gloriously. Learn in what way. When we 
received the remission of sins, and put our hope on the Name, we became new, 
being created again from the beginning; wherefore God truly dwells in us, in the 
habitation which we are. 
<P>9 How? His word of faith, the calling of his promise, the wisdom of the 
ordinances, the commands of the teaching, himself prophesying in us, himself 
dwelling in us, by opening the door of the temple (that is the mouth) to us, 
giving repentance to us, and thus he leads us, who have been enslaved to death 
into the incorruptible temple. 
<P>10 For he who desires to be saved looks not at the man, but at him who dwells 
and speaks in him, and is amazed at him, for he has never either heard him speak 
such words with his mouth, nor has he himself ever desired to hear them. This is 
a spiritual temple being built for the Lord. 
<H3>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 17 
<P>Summary </H3>
<P>1 So far as possibility and simplicity allow an explanation to be given to 
you my soul hopes that none of the things which are necessary for salvation have 
been omitted, according to my desire. 
<P>2 For if I write to you concerning things present or things to come, you will 
not understand because they are hid in parables. This then suffices. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>CHAPTER 18 
<P>The two Ways </H3>
<P>1 Now 
let us pass on to another lesson and teaching. There are two Ways of teaching 
and power, one of Light and one of Darkness. And there is a great difference 
between the two Ways. For over the one are set light-bringing angels of God, but 
over the other angels of Satan. 
<P>2 And the one is Lord from eternity and to eternity, and the other is the 
ruler of the present time of iniquity. 
<H3>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 19 
<P>The Way of Light </H3>
<P>1 The Way of Light is this: if any man desire to journey to the appointed 
place, let him be zealous in his works. Therefore the knowledge given to us of 
this kind that we may walk in it is as follows: 
<P>2 -- Thou shalt love thy maker, thou shalt fear thy Creator, thou shalt 
glorify Him who redeemed thee from death, thou shalt be simple in heart, and 
rich in spirit; thou shalt not join thyself to those who walk in the way of 
death, thou shalt hate all that is not pleasing to God, thou shalt hate all 
hypocrisy; thou shalt not desert the commandments of the Lord. 
<P>3 Thou shalt not exalt thyself, but shall be humble-minded in all things; 
thou shalt not take glory to thyself. Thou shalt form no evil plan against thy 
neighbour, thou shalt not let thy soul be froward. 
<P>4 Thou shalt not commit fornication, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou 
shalt not commit sodomy. Thou shalt not let the word of God depart from thee 
among the impurity of any men. Thou shalt not respect persons in the reproving 
of transgression. Thou shalt be meek, thou shalt be quiet, thou shalt fear the 
words which thou hast heard. Thou shalt not bear malice against thy brother. 
<P><A name=abortion>5</A> Thou shalt not be in two minds whether it shall be or 
not. "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain." Thou shalt love thy 
neighbour more than thy own life. Thou shalt not procure abortion, thou shalt 
not commit infanticide. Thou shalt not withhold thy hand from thy son or from 
thy daughter, but shalt teach them the fear of God from their youth up. 
<P>6 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods, thou shalt not be avaricious. 
Thou shalt not be joined in soul with the haughty but shalt converse with humble 
and righteous men. Thou shalt receive the trials that befall thee as good, 
knowing that nothing happens without God. 
<P>7 Thou shalt not be double-minded or talkative. Thou shalt obey thy masters 
as a type of God in modesty and fear; thou shalt not command in bitterness thy 
slave or handmaid who hope on the same God, lest they cease to fear the God who 
is over you both; for he came not to call men with respect of persons, but those 
whom the Spirit prepared. 
<P>8 Thou shalt share all things with thy neighbour and shall not say that they 
are thy own property; for if you are sharers in that which is incorruptible, how 
much more in that which is corruptible? Thou shalt not be forward to speak, for 
the mouth is a snare of death. So far as thou canst, thou shalt keep thy soul 
pure. 
<P>9 Be not one who stretches out the hands to take, and shuts them when it 
comes to giving. Thou shalt love "as the apple of thine eye" all who speak to 
thee the word of the Lord. 
<P>10 Thou shalt remember the day of judgment day and night, and thou shalt seek 
each day the society of the saints, either labouring by speech, and going out to 
exhort, and striving to save souls by the word, or working with thine hands for 
the ransom of thy sins. 
<P>11 Thou shalt not hesitate to give, and when thou givest thou shalt not 
grumble, but thou shalt know who is the good paymaster of the reward. "Thou 
shalt keep the precepts" which thou hast received, "adding nothing and taking 
nothing away." Thou shalt utterly hate evil. "Thou shalt give righteous 
judgment." 
<P>12 Thou shalt not cause quarrels, but shalt bring together and reconcile 
those that strive. Thou shalt confess thy sins. Thou shalt not betake thyself to 
prayer with an evil conscience. This is the Way of Light. 
<H3>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 20 
<P>The Way of Darkness </H3>
<P>1 But the Way of the Black One is crooked and full of cursing, for it is the 
way of death eternal with punishment, and in it are the things that destroy 
their soul: idolatry, frowardness, arrogance of power, hypocrisy, 
double-heartedness, adultery, murder, robbery, pride, transgression, fraud, 
malice, self-sufficiency, enchantments, magic, covetousness, the lack of the 
fear of God; 
<P>2 persecutors of the good, haters of the truth, lovers of lies, knowing not 
the reward of righteousness, who "cleave not to the good," nor to righteous 
judgment, who attend not to the cause of the widow and orphan, spending wakeful 
nights not in the fear of God, but in the pursuit of vice, from whom meekness 
and patience are far and distant, "loving vanity, seeking rewards," without pity 
for the poor, working not for him who is oppressed with toil, prone to evil 
speaking, without knowledge of their Maker, murderers of children, corrupters of 
God's creation, turning away the needy, oppressing the afflicted, advocates of 
the rich, unjust judges of the poor, altogether sinful. 
<H3>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 21 
<P>Final exhortation </H3>
<P>1 It is good therefore that he who has learned the ordinances of the Lord as 
many as have been written should walk in them. For he who does these things 
shall be glorified in the kingdom of God, and he who chooses the others shall 
perish with his works. For this reason there is a resurrection, for this reason 
there is a recompense. 
<P>2 I beseech those who are in high positions, if you will receive any counsel 
of my goodwill, have among yourselves those to whom you may do good; fail not. 
<P>3 The day is at hand when all things shall perish with the Evil one; "The 
Lord and his reward is at hand." 
<P>4 I beseech you again and again be good lawgivers to each other, remain 
faithful counsellors of each other, remove from yourselves all hypocrisy. 
<P>5 Now may God, who is the Lord over all the world, give you wisdom, 
understanding, prudence, knowledge of his ordinances, patience. 
<P>6 And be taught of God, seeking out what the Lord requires from you, and see 
that ye be found faithful in the day of Judgment. 
<P>7 If there is any memory of good, meditate on these things and remember me, 
that my desire and my watchfulness may find some good end. I beseech you asking 
it of your favour. 
<P>8 While the fair vessel is with you 
fail not in any of them, but seek these things diligently, and fulfil every 
commandment; for these things are worthy. 
<P>9 Wherefore I was the more zealous to write to you of my ability, to give you 
gladness. May you gain salvation, children of love and peace. The Lord of glory 
and of all grace be with your spirit. 
<P>

<H3>NOTES: </H3>
<P><A name=Note1><SUP>1</SUP> Literally "spring."</A> 
<P><A name=Note2><SUP>2</SUP> Or possibly "ordinances" or "decrees."</A> 
<P><A name=Note3><SUP>3</SUP> The first part of this quotation is Ps. 51:19; the 
second part according to a note in _Codex Constantinopolitanus_ is from the 
Apocalypse of Adam, which is no longer extant.</A> 
<P><A name=Note4><SUP>4 </SUP>It is possible that the odd change of construction 
is due to some reference to a well known maxim: but the source of such quotation 
or reference has not been found.</A> 
<P><A name=Note5><SUP>5</SUP> Apparently a loose expression = "confiding in our 
call."</A> 
<P><A name=Note6><SUP>6</SUP> A contrast is here no doubt implied between "that 
Jesus who will be manifested" and the Jesus, or Joshua (the two names are the 
same in Greek) who led the Israelites over the Jordan.</A> 
<P><A name=Note7><SUP>7</SUP> It is probable that Barnabas has mistaken a word 
meaning a hill for the name of a herb with which he was familiar; but it is not 
clear whether the confusion was made in Hebrew or in Greek (rachos = a brier, 
and sometimes a wild-olive, and rachis = a mountain ridge, seems to suggest some 
such possibility). But the identity of the herb is unknown. There is an 
interesting article on it in the Journal of Biblical Literature, 1890, by Rendel 
Harris.</A> 
<P><A name=Note8><SUP>8</SUP> This seems to be the only possible translation, 
but the text must surely be corrupt.</A> 
<P><A name=Note9><SUP>9</SUP> Or "on the tree."</A> 
<P><A name=Note10><SUP>10</SUP> i.e. of the Jews.</A> 
<P><A name=Note11><SUP>11</SUP> In Greek, which expresses numerals by letters, 
this is TIH.</A> 
<P><A name=Note12><SUP>12</SUP> Because IH are in Greek the first letters of the 
word Jesus.</A> 
<P><A name=Note13><SUP>13</SUP> The Greek symbol for 300 is T.</A> 
<P><A name=Note14><SUP>14</SUP> The Latin here given is that of the Old Latin 
version, and does not in all places correspond quite accurately to the 
Greek.</A> 
<P><A name=Note15><SUP>15</SUP> This prohibition is not in the O.T.</A> 
<P><A name=Note16><SUP>16</SUP> Literally the "transgression."</A> 
<P><A name=Note17><SUP>17</SUP> i.e.Joshua the son of Nun, of which names Jesus 
and Naue are the Greek forms.</A> 
<P><A name=Note18><SUP>18</SUP> Here begins the section taken from the "Two 
Ways," Didache 1:1-5:2.</A> 
<P><A name=Note19><SUP>19</SUP> i.e. while you are in the body.</A>
