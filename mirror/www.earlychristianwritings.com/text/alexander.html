<p>AN account of the false priest of Asclepius,
Alexander of Abonoteichus. It has been discussed in detail by Cumont in the <i>Mémoires
couronnées de l’academie de
Belgique, </i>vol. xl (1887).</p>

<p>Although Alexander achieved honour not only in
his own country, a small city in remote Paphlagonia, but over a large part of
the Roman world, almost nothing is known of him except from the pages of
Lucian. Gems, coins, and inscriptions corroborate Lucian as far as they go,
testifying to Alexander’s actual existence and widespread influence, and
commemorating the name and even the appearance of Glycon, his human-headed
serpent. But were it not for Lucian, we should not understand their full
significance.</p>

<p>Alexander’s religious activity covered roughly the
years A.D. 150-170. The cult which he 
established outlasted him for at least a century. It was highly unusual
in its character, as Cumont observes. Sacred snakes were a regular feature of
sanctuaries of Asclepius ; but to give a serpent a human head and style it the
god incarnate was a distinct innovation. Moreover, the proper function of
Asclepius was to heal the sick, who passed the night in his temple, expecting
either to be cured while they slept or to have some form of treatment suggested
to them in their dreams. But at Abonoteichus we hear nothing of incubation, and
only incidentally of healing; the “new Asclepius” deals in oracles like Apollo,
and gives advice on any subject. This, together with Alexander’s extravagant
claims of divine descent, confirms Lucian in his appraisal of him as an
out-and-out charlatan, aiming to play upon the gross credulity of the times and
to secure the greatest gain with the least effort.</p>

<p>Lucian was in a position to know a good deal
about Alexander, and clearly believes all that he says. Without doubt his
account is essentially accurate, but it need not be credited absolutely to the
letter. Lucian was no historian at best, and he was angry. In the account of
his relations with Alexander he reveals his own personality more clearly than
usual, but not in a pleasant light.</p>

<p>The piece was written at the request of a
friend, after A.D. 180, when Alexander had been in his grave for ten years.</p>

<p align="right">
A.M. HARMON
</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>1.&nbsp; No doubt, my dear Celsus,<sup>1</sup> you think it a
slight and trivial matter to bid me set down in a book and send you the history
of Alexander, the impostor of Abonoteichus, including all his clever schemes,
bold emprises, and sleights of hand; but in point of fact, if one should aim to
examine each detail closely, it would be no less a task than to record the
exploits of Philip’s son Alexander. The one was as great in villainy as the
other in heroism. Nevertheless, if it should be your intention to overlook
faults as you read, and to fill out for yourself the gaps in my tale, I will
undertake the task for you and will essay to clean up that Augean stable, if
not wholly, yet to the extent of my ability, fetching out some few basketsful,
so that from them you may judge how great, how inexpressible, was the entire
quantity of filth that three thousand head of cattle
were able to create in many years.</p>

      <p>2.&nbsp; I blush for both of us, I confess, both for you
and for myself—for you because you want a consummate rascal perpetuated in
memory and in writing, and for myself because I am devoting my energy to such
an end, to the exploits of a man who does not deserve to have polite people
read about him, but rather to have the motley crowd in a vast amphitheatre see
him being torn to pieces by foxes or apes. Yet if anyone brings this reproach
against us, we shall be able to refer to an apt precedent. Arrian, the disciple
of Epictetus, a Roman of the highest distinction, and a life-long devotee of
letters, laid himself open to the same charge, and so can plead our cause as
well as his own; he thought fit, you know, to record the life of Tillorobus,
the brigand.<sup>2</sup> In our own case, however, we shall commemorate a far more savage
brigand, since our hero plied his trade not in forests and mountains, but in
cities, and instead of infesting just Mysia and Mount Ida and harrying a few of
the more deserted districts of Asia, he filled the whole Roman Empire, I may
say, with his brigandage.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; First I shall draw you a word-picture of the
man himself, making as close a likeness as I can, although I am not
particularly good at drawing. As regards his person—in order that I may exhibit
this also to you—he was tall and handsome in appearance, and really godlike;
his skin was fair, his beard not very thick; his long hair was in part natural, in
part false, but very similar, so that most people did not detect that it was
not his own. His eyes shone with a great glow of fervour and enthusiasm; his
voice was at once very sweet and very clear; and in a word, no fault could be
found with him in any respect as far as all that went.</p>

      <p>4.&nbsp; Such, then, was his outward appearance; but his
soul and his mind—O Heracles Forfender! O Zeus, Averter of Mischief! O Twin
Brethren, our Saviours! may it be the fortune of our enemies and ill-wishers to
encounter and have to do with the like of him! In understanding,
quick-wittedness, and penetration he was far beyond everyone else; and activity
of mind, readiness to learn, retentiveness, natural aptitude for studies—all
these qualities were his, in every case to the full. But he made the worst
possible use of them, and with these noble instruments at his service soon
became the most perfect rascal of all those who have been notorious far and
wide for villainy, surpassing the Cercopes, surpassing Eurybatus, or Phrynondas,
or Aristodemus, or Sostratus.<sup>3</sup> He himself, writing to his son-in-law Rutilianus
once upon a time and speaking of himself with the greatest reserve, claimed to
be like Pythagoras; but— with all due respect to Pythagoras, a wise man of more
than human intelligence—if he had been this man’s contemporary, he would have
seemed a child, I am very sure, beside him!<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; In the name of the Graces, do not
imagine that I say this to insult Pythagoras, or in the endeavour to bring them into connection with one another by
likening their doings. On the contrary, if all that is worst and most opprobrious
in what is said of Pythagoras to discredit him (which I for my part cannot
believe to be true) should nevertheless be brought together for comparison, the
whole of it would be but an infinitesimal part of Alexander’s knavery. In sum,
imagine, please, and mentally configure a highly diversified soul-blend, made
up of lying, trickery, perjury, and malice; facile, audacious, venturesome,
diligent in the execution of its schemes, plausible, convincing, masking as
good, and wearing an appearance absolutely opposite to its purpose. indeed,
there is nobody who, after meeting him for the first time, did not come away
with the idea that he was the most honest and upright man in the world—yes, and
the most simple and unaffected. And on top of all this, he had the quality of
magnificence, of forming no petty designs but always keeping his mind upon the
most important objects.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp; While he was still a mere boy, and a very handsome
one, as could be inferred from the sere and yellow leaf of him, and could also
be learned by hearsay from those who recounted his story, he trafficked freely
in his attractiveness and sold his company to those who sought it. Among
others, he had an admirer who was a quack, one of those who advertise
enchantments, miraculous incantations, charms for your love-affairs, “sendings”
<sup>5</sup> for your enemies, disclosures of buried treasure, and successions to
estates. As this man saw that he was an apt lad, more than ready to assist him
in his affairs, and that the boy was quite as much enamoured with
his roguery as he with the boy’s beauty, he gave him a thorough education and
constantly made use of him as helper, servant, and acolyte. He himself was
professedly a public physician, but, as Homer says of the wife of Thon, the
Egyptian, he knew</p>

      <blockquote>

<p>“Many a drug that was good in a compound, and
many a bad one,”<sup>6</sup></p>

      </blockquote>

<p>all of which Alexander inherited and took over.
This teacher and admirer of his was a man of Tyana by birth, one of those who
had been followers of the notorious Apollonius, and who knew his whole bag of
tricks. You see what sort of school the man that I am describing comes from!</p>

      <p>6.&nbsp; Alexander was just getting his beard when the
death of the Tyanean put him in a bad way, since it coincided with the passing
of his beauty, by which he might have supported himself. So he abandoned petty
projects for ever. He formed a partnership with a Byzantine writer of choral
songs, one of those who enter the public competitions, far more abominable than
himself by nature— Cocconas,<sup>7 </sup>I think, was his nickname,— and they
went about the country practising quackery and sorcery, and “trimming the
fatheads “—for so they style the public in the traditional patter of magicians.
Well, among these they hit upon a rich Macedonian woman, past her prime but
still eager to be charming, and not only lined their purses fairly well at her
expense, but went with her from Bithynia to Macedon. She came from Pella, a place once flourishing in
the time of the kings of Macedon but now insignificant, with very few
inhabitants. [7] There they saw great serpents, quite tame and gentle, so that
they were kept by women, slept with children, let themselves be stepped upon,
were not angry when they were stroked, and took milk from the breast just like
babies. There are many such in the country, and that, probably, is what gave
currency in former days to the story about Olympias; no doubt a serpent of that
sort slept with her when she was carrying Alexander.<sup>8</sup> So they bought one of the
reptiles, the finest, for a few coppers; [8] and, in the words of Thucydides:
“Here beginneth the war!”<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>As you might have expected of two consummate
rascals, greatly daring, fully prepared for mischief, who had put their heads
together, they readily discerned that human life is swayed by two great
tyrants, hope and fear, and that a man who could use both of these to advantage
would speedily enrich himself. For they perceived that both to one who fears
and to one who hopes, foreknowledge is very essential and very keenly coveted,
and that long ago not only Delphi, but Delos and Clarus and Branchidae, had
become rich and famous because, thanks to the tyrants just mentioned, hope and
fear, men continually visited their sanctuaries and sought to learn the future
in advance, and to that end sacrificed hecatombs and dedicated ingots of gold.
By turning all this round and round in conference with one another and keeping it astir, they concocted
the project of founding a prophetic shrine and oracle, hoping that if they
should succeed in it, they would at once be rich and prosperous—which, in fact,
befell them in greater measure than they at first expected, and turned out
better than they hoped.</p>

      <p>9.&nbsp; Then they began planning, first about the
place, and next, what should be the commencement and the character of the
venture. Cocconas thought Chalcedon a suitable and convenient place, close to
Thrace and Bithynia, and not far, too, from Asia<sup>10</sup> and Galatia and
all the peoples of the interior. Alexander, on the other hand, preferred his
own home, saying— and it was true—that to commence such a venture they needed
“fat-heads” and simpletons to be their victims, and such, he said, were the
Paphlagonians who lived up above Abonoteichus, who were for the most part
superstitious and rich; when­ever a man but turned up with someone at his heels
to play the flute or the tambourine or the cymbals, telling fortunes with a sieve,
as the phrase goes,<sup>11</sup> they were all agog over him on the instant and
stared at him as if he were a god from heaven.</p>

<p>10.&nbsp; There was no slight difference of opinion between
them on that score, but in the end Alexander won, and going to Chalcedon, since
after all that city seemed to them to have some usefulness, in the temple of
Apollo, which is the most ancient in Chalcedon, they buried bronze tablets
which said that very soon Asclepius, with his father Apollo, would move to
Pontus and take up his residence at Abonoteichus. The opportune discovery of
these tablets caused this story to spread quickly to all Bithynia and Pontus,
and to Abonoteichus sooner than anywhere else. Indeed, the people of that city
immediately voted to build a temple and began at once to dig for the
foundations. Then Cocconas was left behind in Chalcedon, composing equivocal, ambiguous,
obscure oracles, and died before long, bitten, I think, by a viper. [11] It was
Alexander who was sent in first; he now wore his hair long, had falling
ringlets, dressed in a parti-coloured tunic of white and purple, with a white
cloak over it, and carried a falchion like that of Perseus, from whom he
claimed descent on his mother’s side. And although those miserable
Paphlagonians knew that both his parents were obscure, humble folk, they
believed the oracle when it said:</p>

      <blockquote>

<p align="center">“Here in your sight is a scion of Perseus, dear
unto Phoebus;<br>
This is
divine Alexander, who shareth the blood of the Healer!”</p>

      </blockquote>

<p>Podaleirius, the Healer, it would appear, was
so passionate and amorous that his ardour carried him all the way from Tricca
to Paphlagonia in quest of Alexander’s mother! <sup> 12</sup></p>

<p>An oracle by now had turned up which purported
to be a prior prediction by the Sibyl:</p>

      <p align="center">“On the shores of the Euxine sea, in the neighbourhood
      of Sinope,<br>
      There shall be born, by a Tower, in the days of
the Romans, a prophet;<br>
      After the foremost unit and three times ten, he
will shew forth<br>
      Five more
units besides, and a score told three times over,<br>
      Matching, with places four, the name of a
valiant defender !” <sup>13</sup></p>

      <p>12.&nbsp; Well, upon invading his native land with all
this pomp and circumstance after a long absence, Alexander was a man of mark
and note, affecting as he did to have occasional fits of madness anti causing
his mouth to fill with foam. This he easily managed by chewing the root of
soapwort, the plant that dyers use; but to his fellow-countrymen even the foam
seemed supernatural and awe-inspiring. Then, too, they had long ago prepared
and fitted up a serpent’s head of linen, which had something of a human look, was all painted up, and
appeared very lifelike. It would open and close its mouth by means of
horsehairs, and a forked black tongue like a snake’s, also controlled by
horsehairs, would dart out. Besides, the serpent from Pella was ready in
advance and was being cared for at home, destined in due time to manifest
himself to them and to take a part in their show—in fact, to be cast for the
leading rôle.</p>

      <p>13.&nbsp; When at length it was time to begin, he contrived
an ingenious ruse. Going at night to the foundations of the temple which were
just being excavated, where a pool of water had gathered which either issued
from springs somewhere in the foundations themselves or had fallen from the
sky, he secreted there a goose-egg, previously blown, which contained a snake
just born; and after burying it deep in the mud, he went back again. In the
morning he ran out into the market-place naked, wearing a loin-cloth (this too
was gilded),<sup>14 </sup>carrying his falchion, and tossing his unconfined mane
like a devotee of the Great Mother in the frenzy. Addressing the people from a
high altar upon which he had climbed, he congratulated the city because it was
at once to receive the god in visible presence. The assembly—for almost the
whole city, including women, old men, and boys, had come running— marvelled,
prayed and made obeisance. Uttering, a few meaningless words like Hebrew or
Phoenician, he dazed the creatures, who did not know what he was saying save only that he everywhere brought
in Apollo and Asclepius. [14] Then he ran at full speed to the future temple, went
to the excavation and the previously improvised fountain-head of the oracle,
entered ‘the water, sang hymns in honour of Asclepius and Apollo at the top of
his voice, and besought the god, under the blessing of Heaven, to come to the
city. Then he asked for a libation-saucer, and when somebody handed him one,
deftly slipped it underneath and brought up, along with water and mud, that egg
in which he had immured the god; the joint about the plug had been closed with
wax and white lead. Taking it in his hands, he asserted that at that moment he
held Asclepius! They gazed unwaveringly to see what in the world was going to
happen; indeed, they had already marvelled at the discovery of the egg in the
water. But when he broke it and received the tiny snake into his hollowed hand,
and the crowd saw it moving and twisting about his fingers, they at once raised
a shout, welcomed the god, congratulated their city, and began each of them to
sate him­self greedily with prayers, craving treasures, riches, health, and
every other blessing from, him. But Alexander went home again at full speed,
taking with him the new-born Asclepius, “born twice, when other men are born
but once,”<sup>15</sup> whose mother was not Coronis,<sup>16 </sup>by Zeus, nor yet a crow,
but a goose! And the whole population followed, all full of religious fervour
and crazed with expectations.</p>

      <p>15.&nbsp; For some days he remained at home, expecting
what actually happened—that as the news spread, crowds of Paphlagonians would
come running in. When the city had become over-full of people, all of them
already bereft of their brains and sense, and not in the least like
bread-eating humans, but different from beasts of the field only in their
looks, he seated himself on a couch in a certain chamber, clothed in apparel
well suited to a god, and took into his bosom his Asclepius from Pella, who, as
      I have said, was of uncommon size and beauty.<sup>17</sup> Coiling him about his neck, and
letting the tail, which was long, stream over his lap and drag part of its
length on the floor, he concealed only the head by holding it under his arm—the
creature would submit to anything—and showed the linen head at one side of his
own beard, as if it certainly belonged to the creature that was in view.</p>

<p>16.&nbsp; Now then, please imagine a little room, not
very bright and not admitting any too much daylight; also, a crowd of
heterogeneous humanity, excited, wonder-struck in advance, agog with hopes.
When they went in, the thing, of course, seemed to them a miracle, that the
formerly tiny snake within a few days had turned into so great a serpent, with
a human face, moreover, and tame! They were immediately crowded towards the
exit, and before they could look closely were forced out by those who kept
coming in, for another door had been opened on the opposite side as an
exit. That was the way the Macedonians did, they say, in Babylon during
Alexander’s illness, when he was in a bad way and they surrounded the palace,
craving to see. him and say good-bye. This exhibition the scoundrel gave not
merely once, they say, but again and again, above all if any rich men were
newly arrived.</p>

      <p>17.&nbsp; In that matter, dear Celsus, to tell the truth,
we must excuse those men of Paphlagonia and Pontus, thick-witted, uneducated
fellows that they were, for being deluded when they touched the serpent—
Alexander let anyone do so who wished—and besides saw in a dim light what
purported to be its head opening and shutting its mouth. Really the trick stood
in need of a Democritus, or even Epicurus himself or Metrodorus, or someone
else with a mind as firm as adamant toward such matters, so as to disbelieve
and guess the truth— one who, if he could not discover how it went, would at
all events be convinced beforehand that though the method of the fraud escaped
him, it was nevertheless all sham and could not possibly happen.</p>

<p>18.&nbsp; Little by little, Bithynia, Galatia, and Thrace
came pouring in, for everyone who carried the news very likely said that he not
only had seen the god born but had subsequently touched him, after he had grown
very great in a short time and had a face that looked like a man’s. Next came
paintings and statues and cult-images, some made of bronze, some of silver, and
naturally a name was bestowed upon the god. He was called Glycon in consequence
of a divine behest in metre; for Alexander proclaimed:</p>

<p align="center">“Glycon am I, the grandson of Zeus, bright
beacon to mortals!”</p>

      <p>19.&nbsp; When it was time to carry out the purpose for
which the whole scheme had been concocted—that is to say, to make predictions
and give oracles to those who sought them—taking his cue from Amphilochus in
Cilicia, who, as you know, after the death and disappearance of his father
Amphiaraus at Thebes,<sup>18</sup> was exiled from his own country, went to Cilicia, and
got on very well by foretelling the future, like his father, for the Cilicians
and getting two obols for each prediction—taking, as I say, his cue from him,
Alexander announced to all comers that the god would make prophecies, and named
a date for it in advance. He directed everyone to write down in a scroll
whatever he wanted and what he especially wished to learn, to tie it up, and to
seal it with wax or clay or something else of that sort. Then he himself, after
taking the scrolls and entering the inner sanctuary—for by that time the temple
had been erected and the stage set—proposed to summon in order, with herald
and priest, those who had submitted them, and after the god told him about each
case, to give back the scroll with the seal upon it, just as it was, and the
reply to it endorsed upon it; for the god would reply explicitly to any question
that anyone should put.</p>

<p>20.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, this trick, to a man like
you, and if it is not out of place to say so, like myself also, was obvious and
easy to see through, but to those drivelling idiots it was miraculous and
almost as good as incredible. Having discovered various ways of undoing the
seals, he would read all the questions and answer them as he thought best. Then
he would roll up the scrolls again, seal them, and give them back, to the great
astonishment of the recipients, among whom the comment was frequent: “Why, how
did he learn the questions which I gave him very securely sealed with
impressions
hard to counterfeit, unless there was really some god that knew everything?”</p>

<p>21.&nbsp; “What were his discoveries, then?” perhaps you
will ask. Listen, therefore, in order to be able to show up such impostors. The
first, my dear Celsus, was a well-known method; heating a needle, he removed
the seal by melting through the wax underneath it, and after reading the
contents he warmed the wax once more with the needle, both that which was under
the thread and that which contained the seal, and so stuck it together without
difficulty. Another method was by using what they call plaster; this is a
compound of Bruttian pitch, asphalt, pulverized gypsum, wax, and gum Arabic.
Making his plaster out of all these materials and warming it over the fire, he
applied it to the seal, which he had previously wetted with saliva, and took a
mould of the impression. Then, since the plaster hardened at once, after easily
opening and reading the scrolls, he applied the wax and made an impression upon
it precisely like the original, just as one would with a gem. Let me tell you a
third method, in addition to these. Putting
marble-dust into the glue with which they glue books and making a paste of it,
he applied that to the seal while it was still soft, and then, as it grows hard
at once, more solid than horn or even iron, he removed it and used it for the
impression. There are many other devices to this end, but they need not all be
mentioned, for fear that we might seem to be wanting in taste, especially in view
of the fact that in the book which you wrote against the sorcerers, a very good
and useful treatise, capable of preserving common-sense in its readers, you
cited instances enough, and indeed a great many more than I have.<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>22.&nbsp; Well, as I say, Alexander made predictions and
gave oracles, employing great shrewdness in it and combining guesswork with his
trickery. He gave responses that were sometimes obscure and am­biguous,
sometimes downright unintelligible, for this seemed to him in the oracular
manner. Some people he dissuaded or encouraged as seemed best to him at a
guess. To others he prescribed medical treatments and diets, knowing, as I said
in the beginning, many useful remedies. His “cytmides” were in highest favour
with him—a name which he had coined for a restorative ointment compounded of
bear’s grease.<sup>20 </sup>Expectations, however, and advancements and successions to estates he
always put off to another day, adding: “It shall all come about when I will,
and when Alexander, my prophet, asks it of me and prays for you.”</p>

      <p>23.&nbsp; A price had been fixed for each oracle, a
drachma and two obols.<sup>21</sup> Do not think that it was low, my friend, or that the
revenue from this source was scanty! He gleaned as much as seventy or eighty
thousand <sup>22</sup> a year, since men were so greedy as to send in ten and fifteen
questions each. What he received he did not use for himself alone nor treasure
up to make himself rich, but since he had many men about him by this time as
assistants, servants, collectors of information, writers of oracles, custodians
of oracles, clerks, sealers, and expounders, he divided with all, giving each
one what was proportionate to his worth.</p>

<p>24.&nbsp; By now he was even sending men abroad to create
rumours in the different nations in regard to the oracle and to say that he
made predictions, discovered fugitive slaves, detected thieves and robbers,
caused treasures to be dug up, healed the sick, and in some cases had actually
raised the dead. So there was a hustling and a bustling from every side, with
sacrifices and votive offerings—and twice as much for the prophet and disciple
of the god. For this oracle also had come out:</p>

<p align="center">“Honour I bid you to give my faithful servant,
the prophet;<br>
No great store do I set upon riches, but much
on the prophet.”</p>

<p>25.&nbsp; When at last many sensible men, recovering, as
it were, from profound intoxication, combined against him, especially all the
followers of Epicurus, and when in the cities they began gradually to detect
all the trickery and buncombe of the show, he issued a promulgation designed to
scare them, saying that Pontus was full of atheists and Christians who had the
hardihood to utter the vilest abuse of him; these he bade them drive away with
stones if they wanted to have the god gracious. About Epicurus, moreover, he
delivered himself of an oracle after this sort; when someone asked him how
Epicurus was doing in Hades, he replied:</p>

<p align="center">“With leaden
fetters on his feet in filthy mire he sitteth.”</p>

<p>Do you wonder, then, that the shrine waxed
great, now that you see that the questions of its visitors were intelligent and
refined?</p>

      <p>In general, the war that he waged upon Epicurus
was without truce or parley, naturally enough. Upon whom else would a quack who
loved humbug and bitterly hated truth more fittingly make war than upon
Epicurus, who discerned the nature of things and alone knew the truth in them?
The followers of Plato and Chrysippus and Pythagoras were his friends, and
there was profound peace with them; but “the impervious Epicurus” —for
that is what he called him—was rightly his bitter enemy, since he considered
all that sort of thing a laughing-matter and a joke. So Alexander hated
Amastris most of all the cities in Pontus because he knew that the followers of
      Lepidus <sup>23</sup> and others like them
were numerous in the city; and he would never deliver an oracle to an
Amastrian. Once when he did venture to make a prediction for a senator’s
brother, he acquitted himself ridiculously, since he could neither compose a
clever response himself nor find anyone else who could do it in time. The man
      complained of colic, and Alexander, wishing to direct him to eat a pig’s foot
cooked with mallow, said:</p>

<p align="center">“Mallow with cummin digest in a sacred pipkin
of piglets.”</p>

<p>26.&nbsp; Again and again, as I said before, he exhibited
the serpent to all who requested it, not in its entirety, but exposing chiefly
the tail and the rest of the body and keeping the head out of sight under his
arm. But as he wished to astonish the crowd still more, he promised to produce
the god talking—delivering oracles in person without a prophet. It was no
difficult matter for him to fasten cranes' windpipes together and pass them
through the head, which he had so fashioned as to be lifelike. Then he answered
the questions through someone else, who spoke into the tube from the outside,
so that the voice issued from his canvas Asclepius.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p>These oracles were called autophones, and were
not given to everybody promiscuously, but only to those who were noble, rich, and free-handed.
[27] For example, the oracle given to Severianus in regard to his invasion of
Armenia was one of the autophones. Alexander encouraged him to the invasion by
saying:</p>

<p align="center">“Under your charging spear shall fall Armenians
and Parthi;<br>
Then you shall fare to Rome and the glorious
waters of Tiber<br>
Wearing upon your brow the chaplet studded with
sunbeams.” <sup>25</sup></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then when that silly Celt, being convinced,
made the invasion and ended by getting himself and his army cut to bits by
Osroes, Alexander expunged this oracle from his records and inserted another in
its place</p>

<p align="center">“Better for you that your forces against
Armenia march not,<br>
Lest some man, like a woman bedight, despatch
from his bowstring<br>
Grim death, cutting you off from life and enjoyment
of sunlight.” <sup> 26</sup></p>

<p>28.&nbsp; That was one of his devices, and a very clever
one—belated oracles to make amends for those in which he had made bad
predictions and missed the mark. Often he would promise good health to sick men before their demise, and when they died
another oracle would be ready with a recantation:</p>

<p align="center">“Seek no more for assistance against thy bitter
affliction;<br>
Death now standeth in view; ‘tis beyond thy
power to ‘scape him.”</p>

<p>29.&nbsp; As he was aware that the priests at Clarus and
Didymi and Mallus were themselves in high repute for the same sort of
divination, he made them his friends by sending many of his visitors to them,
saying:</p>

      <p align="center">“Now unto Clarus begone, to the voice of my
father<sup>27 </sup>to hearken.”</p>

<p>and at another time,</p>

<p align="center">Visit the fane of the Branchids and hear what
the oracle sayeth,”</p>

<p>and again,</p>

<p align="center">“Make thy way unto Mallus and let Amphilochus
answer.”</p>

      <p>30.&nbsp; So far, we have been concerned with his doings
near the frontier, extending over Ionia, Cilicia, Paphlagonia, and Galatia.
But when the renown of his prophetic shrine spread to Italy and invaded the
city of Rome, everybody without exception, each on the other’s heels, made
haste, some to go in person, some to send; this was the case particularly with
those who had the greatest power and the highest rank in the city. The first
and foremost of these was Rutilianus,<sup>28</sup> who, though a man of birth and
      breeding, put to the proof in many Roman
offices, nevertheless in all that concerned the gods was very infirm and held
strange beliefs about them. If he but saw anywhere a stone smeared with holy
oil or adorned with a wreath,<sup>29</sup> he would fall on his face forthwith, kiss his
hand, and stand beside it for a long time making vows and craving blessings
from it.</p>

<p>When this man heard the tales about the oracle,
he very nearly abandoned the office which had been committed to him and took
wing to Abonoteichus. Anyhow, he sent one set of messengers after another, and
his emissaries, mere illiterate serving-people, were easily deluded, so when
they came back, they told not only what they had seen but what they had heard
as if they had seen it, and threw in something more for good measure, so as to
gain favour with their master. Consequently, they inflamed the poor old man and
made him absolutely crazy. [31] Having many powerful friends, he went about not only
telling what he had heard from his messengers but adding still more on his own
account. So he flooded and convulsed the city, and agitated most of the court,
who themselves at once hastened to go and hear something that concerned them.</p>

<p>To all who came, Alexander gave a very cordial
reception, made them think well of him by lavish entertainment and expensive
presents, and sent them back not merely to report the answers to
their questions, but to sing the praises of the god and to tell portentous lies
about the oracle on their own account. [32] At the same time, however, the plaguy
scoundrel devised a trick which was really clever and not what one would expect
of your ordinary swindler. In opening and reading the forwarded scrolls, if he
found anything dangerous and venturesome in the questions, he would keep them
himself and not send them back, in order to hold the senders in subjection and
all but in slavery because of their fear, since they remembered what it was
that they had asked. You understand what questions are likely to be put by men
who are rich and very powerful. So he used to derive much gain from those men,
who knew that he had them in his net.</p>

<p>33.&nbsp; I should like to tell you some of the
responses that were given to Rutilianus. Asking about his son by a former
marriage, who was then in the full bloom of youth, he enquired who should be
appointed his tutor in his studies. The reply was:</p>

<p align="center">“Be it Pythagoras; aye, and the good bard,
master of warfare.”</p>

<p>Then after a few days the boy died, and Alexander
was at his wit’s end, with nothing to say to his critics, as the oracle had
been shown up so obviously. But Rutilianus himself, good soul, made haste to
defend the oracle by saying that the god had predicted precisely this outcome,
and on account of it had bidden him to select as his tutor nobody then alive,
but rather Pythagoras and Homer, who died long ago, with whom, no doubt, the
lad was then studying in Hades. What fault, then, should we find with
Alexander if he thought fit to amuse himself at the expense of such homunculi?</p>

<p>34.&nbsp; At another time, when Rutilianus enquired whose
soul he had inherited, the reply was:</p>

<p align="center">“Peleus’ son wert thou at the first; thereafter
Menander,<br>
Then what thou seemest now, and hereafter shalt
turn to a sunbeam.<br>
Four score seasons of life shall be given thee
over a hundred.”</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact he died insane at
seventy without awaiting the fulfilment of the god’s promise! [35] This oracle too
was one of the autophones.</p>

<p>When one time he enquired about getting
married, Alexander said explicitly:</p>

<p align="center">“Take Alexander’s daughter to wife, who was
born of Selene.”</p>

<p>He had long before given out a story to the
effect that his daughter was by Selene; for Selene had fallen in love with him
on seeing him asleep once upon a time—it is a habit of hers, you know, to adore
handsome lads in their sleep ! <sup>30</sup> Without any hesitation that prince of sages
Rutilianus sent for the girl at once, celebrated his nuptials as a
sexagenarian bridegroom, and took her to wife, propitiating his mother-in-law,
the moon, with whole hecatombs and imagining that he&nbsp; himself had become one of
the Celestials!</p>

<p>36.&nbsp; No sooner did Alexander get Italy in hand than he began to devise projects that were ever greater and greater, and sent
oracle-mongers everywhere in the Roman Empire, warning the cities to be on
their guard against plagues and conflagrations and earth­quakes; he promised
that he would himself afford them infallible aid so that none of these
calamities should befall them. There was one oracle, also an autophone, which
he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence <sup>31</sup>; it was but a single
verse:</p>

<p align="center">“Phoebus, the god unshorn, keepeth off plague’s
nebulous onset.”</p>

<p>This verse was to be seen everywhere written
over doorways as a charm against the plague; but in most cases it had the
contrary result. By some chance it was particularly the houses on which the
verse was inscribed that were depopulated! Do not suppose me to mean that they
were stricken on account of the verse—by some chance or other it turned out
that way, and perhaps, too, people neglected precautions because of their
confidence in the line and lived too carelessly, giving the oracle no
assistance against the disease because they were going to have the syllables to
defend them and “unshorn Phoebus” to drive away the plague with his arrows!</p>

<p>37.&nbsp; Moreover, Alexander posted a great number of
his fellow-conspirators in Rome itself as his agents, who reported everyone’s
views to him and gave him advance information about the questions and the
especial wishes of those who consulted him, so that the messengers might find
him ready to answer even before they arrived</p>

      <p>38.&nbsp; He made these preparations to meet the
situation in Italy, and also made notable preparations at home. He established a celebration of mysteries, with
torch­light ceremonies and priestly offices, which was to be held annually, for
three days in succession, in perpetuity. On the first day, as at Athens,<sup>32</sup>
there was a proclamation, worded as follows: “If any atheist or Christian or
Epicurean has come to spy upon the rites, let him be off, and let those who
believe in the god perform the mysteries, under the blessing of Heaven.” Then,
at the very outset, there was an “expulsion,” in which he took the lead,
saying: “Out with the Christians,” and the whole
multitude chanted in response, “Out with the Epicureans!” Then there was the
child-bed of Leto, the birth of Apollo, his marriage to Coronis, and the birth
of Asclepius. On the second day came the manifestation of Glycon, including
the birth of the god. [39] On the third day there was the union of Podaleirius and
the mother of Alexander—it was called the Day of Torches, and torches were
burned. In conclusion there was the amour of Selene and Alexander, and the
birth of Rutilianus’ wife. The torch-bearer and hierophant was our Endymion,
Alexander. While he lay in full view, pretending to be asleep, there came down
to him from the roof, as if from heaven, not Selene but Rutilia, a very pretty
woman, married to one of the Emperor’s stewards. She was genuinely in love with
Alexander and he with her; and before the eyes of her worthless husband there
were kisses and embraces in public. If the torches had not been numerous, perhaps the thing would
have been carried even further. After a short time Alexander entered again, robed
as a priest, amid profound silence, and said in a loud voice, over and over
again, “Hail, Glycon,” while, following in his train, a number of would-be
Eumolpids and Ceryces<sup>33</sup> from Paphlagonia, with brogans on their feet and breaths
that reeked of garlic, shouted in response, “Hail, Alexander!”</p>

      <p>40.&nbsp; Often in the course of the torchlight
ceremonies and the gambols of the mysteries his thigh was bared purposely and
showed golden. No doubt gilded leather had been put about it, which gleamed in
the light of the cressets. There was once a discussion between two of our
learned idiots in regard to him, whether he had the soul of Pythagoras, on
account of the golden thigh, or some other soul akin to it.<sup>34 </sup>They
referred this question to Alexander himself, and King Glycon resolved their
doubt with an oracle:</p>

<p align="center">“Nay, Pythagoras’ soul now waneth and
other times waxeth;<br>
His, with prophecy gifted, from God’s mind
taketh its issue,<br>
Sent by the Father to aid good men in the
stress of the conflict;<br>
Then it to God will return, by God’s own
thunder­bolt smitten.”</p>

<p>41.&nbsp; Although he cautioned all to abstain from intercourse
with boys on the ground that it was impious, for his own part this pattern of
propriety made a clever arrangement. He commanded the cities in Pontus and
Paphlagonia to send choir-boys for three years’ service, to sing hymns to the god in his
household; they were required to examine, select, and send the noblest,
youngest, and most handsome. These he kept under ward and treated like bought
slaves, sleeping with them and affronting them in every way. He made it a rule,
too, not to greet anyone over eighteen years with his lips, or to embrace and
kiss him; he kissed only the young, extending his hand to the others to be
kissed by them. They were called “those within the kiss.”</p>

<p>42.&nbsp; He duped the simpletons in this way from first
to last, ruining women right and left as well as living with favourites.
Indeed, it was a great thing that everyone coveted if he simply cast his eyes
upon a man’s wife; if, however, he deemed her worthy of a kiss, each husband
thought that good fortune would flood his house. Many women even boasted that
they had had children by Alexander, and their husbands bore witness that they
spoke the truth!</p>

<p>43.&nbsp; I want to include in my tale a dialogue between
Glycon and one Sacerdos, a man of Tius, whose intelligence you will be able to
appraise from his questions. I read the conversation in an inscription in
letters of gold, at Tius, in the house of Sacerdos. “Tell me, Master Glycon,” said
he, “who are you?” “I am the latter-day Asclepius,” he replied. “A different
person from the one of former times? What do you mean?” “It is not permitted
you to hear that.” “How many years will you tarry among us delivering oracles?”
“One thousand and three.” “Then where shall you go?” “To Bactra and that
region, for the barbarians too must profit by my presence among men.” “What of the other prophetic shrines, the
one in Didymi, the one in Clarus, and the one in Delphi—do they still have your
father Apollo as the source of their oracles, or are the predictions now given
out there false?” “This too you must not wish to know; it is not permitted.”
“What about myself—what shall I be after my present life?” “A camel, then a horse,
then a wise man and prophet just as great as Alexander.”</p>

<p>That was Glycon’s conversation with Sacerdos;
and in conclusion he uttered an oracle in verse, knowing that Sacerdos was a
follower of Lepidus:’</p>

<p align="center">“Put not
in Lepidus faith, for a pitiful doom is in waiting.”</p>

<p>That was because he greatly feared Epicurus, as
I have said before, seeing in him an opponent and critic of his trickery.</p>

      <p>44.&nbsp; Indeed, he seriously imperilled one of the Epicureans
who ventured to expose him in the presence of a great crowd. The man went up
to him and said in a loud voice: “Come now, Alexander! You prevailed upon
such-and-such a Paphlagonian to put his servants on trial for their lives
before the governor of Galatia on the charge that they had murdered his son, a
student at Alexandria. But the young man is living, and has come back alive
after the execution of the servants, whom you gave over to the wild beasts.”
What had happened was this. The young man cruised up the Nile as far as Clysma,<sup>35</sup>
and as a vessel was just putting to sea, was induced to join others in a voyage
to India. Then because he was overdue, those ill-starred servants
concluded that the young man either had lost his life during his cruise upon the
      Nile or had been made away with by brigands, who were numerous at the
time; and they returned with the report of his disappearance. Then followed
the oracle and their condemnation, after which the young man presented
himself, telling of his travels.</p>

      <p>45.&nbsp; When he told this tale, Alexander, indignant at
the exposure and unable to bear the truth of the reproach, told the bystanders
to stone him, or else they themselves would be accurst and would bear the name
of Epicureans. They had begun to throw stones when a man named Demostratus who
happened to be in the city, one of the most prominent men in Pontus,<sup>36</sup> flung his
arms about the fellow and saved him from death. But he had come very near to
being overwhelmed with stones, and quite properly! Why did he have to be the only man of sense among all those lunatics and suffer from the idiocy of the
Paphlagonians?</p>

<p>46.&nbsp; That man, then, was thus dealt with. Moreover,
if in any case, when men were called up in the order of their applications
(which took place the day before the prophecies were given out) and the herald
enquired: “Has he a prophecy for So-and-so,” the reply came from within: “To
the ravens,” nobody would ever again receive such a person under his roof or
give him fire or water, but he had to be harried from country to country as an
impious man, an atheist, and an Epicurean—which, indeed, was their strongest
term of abuse.</p>

      <p>47.&nbsp; One of Alexander’s acts in this connection was
most comical. Hitting upon the “Established Beliefs” of Epicurus, which is the
finest of his books, as you know, and contains in summary the articles of the man’s philosophic creed,<sup>37</sup>
      he brought it into the middle of the market-place,
burned it on fagots of fig-wood just as if he were burning the man in person,
and threw the ashes into the sea, even adding an oracle also:</p>

<p align="center">“Burn with fire, I command you, the creed of a
purblind dotard!”</p>

<p>But the scoundrel had no idea what blessings
that book creates for its readers and what peace, tranquillity, and freedom it
engenders in them, liberating them as it does from terrors and apparitions and
portents, from vain hopes and extravagant cravings, developing in them intelligence and truth, and truly purifying their understanding, not with
torches and squills and that sort of foolery, but with straight thinking,
truthfulness and frankness.</p>

<p>48.&nbsp; Of all this blackguard’s emprises, however,
hear one, the greatest. Since he had no slight influence in the palace and at
court through the favour which Rutilianus enjoyed, he published an oracle at
the height of the war in Germany, when the late Emperor Marcus himself had at
last come to grips with the Marcomanni and Quadi. The oracle recommended that
two lions be cast into the Danube alive, together with a quantity of perfumes
and magnificent offerings. But it will be better to
repeat the oracle itself.</p>

<p align="center">“Into the
pools of the Ister, the stream that from Zeus taketh issue,<br>
Hurl, I command you, a pair of Cybele’s
faithful attendants,<br>
Beasts that dwell on the mountains, and all that the Indian climate<br>
Yieldeth of flower and herb that is fragrant;
amain there shall follow<br>
Victory and great glory, and welcome peace in
their footsteps.”</p>

      <p>But when all this had been done as he had
directed, the lions swam across to the enemy territory and the barbarians
slaughtered them with clubs, thinking them some kind of foreign dogs or wolves;
and “amain” that tremendous disaster befel our side, in which a matter of
twenty thousand were wiped out at a blow. Then came what happened at Aquileia,
and that city’s narrow escape from capture. To meet this issue, Alexander was
flat enough to adduce the Delphian defence in the matter of the oracle given
to Croesus, that the God had indeed foretold victory, but had not indicated
whether it would go to the Romans or to the enemy.<sup>38</sup></p>

<p>49.&nbsp; As by this time throngs upon throngs were pouring
in and their city was becoming overcrowded on account of the multitude of
visitors to the shrine, so that it had not sufficient provisions, he devised the so-called “nocturnal” responses. Taking
the scrolls, he slept on them, so he said, and gave replies that he pretended
to have heard from the god in a dream; which, however, were in most cases not
clear but ambiguous and confused, particularly when he observed that the scroll
had been sealed up with unusual care. Taking no extra chances, he would append
at random whatever answer came into his head, thinking that this procedure too
was appropriate to oracles; and there were certain expounders who sat by with
that in view and garnered large fees from the recipients of such oracles for
explaining and unriddling them. Moreover, this task of theirs was subject to a
levy; the expounders paid Alexander an Attic talent each.</p>

<p>50.&nbsp; Sometimes, to amaze dolts, he would deliver an
oracle for the benefit of someone who had neither enquired nor sent—who, in
fact, did not exist at all. For example:</p>

<p align="center">“Seek thou out that man who in utmost secrecy
shrouded<br>
Tumbleth at home on the couch thy helpmeet Calligeneia,<br>
Slave Protogenes, him upon whom thou fully reliest.<br>
He was corrupted by thee, and now thy wife he
corrupteth,<br>
Making a bitter return unto thee for his own
violation.<br>
Aye more, now against thee a baneful charm they
have fashioned<br>
So that thou mayst not hear nor see what deeds
they are doing;<br>
This shalt thou find on the floor, beneath thy
bed, by the wall-side,<br>
Close to the head; thy servant Calypso shareth the secret.”</p>

      <p>What Democritus<sup>39</sup> would not have been disturbed
on hearing names amid places specified—and would not have been filled with
contempt soon afterward, when he saw through their stratagem?</p>

<p>52.<sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Again, to someone else who was not there and
did not exist at all, he said in prose: “Go back; he&nbsp; who sent you was killed
today by his neighbour Diodes, with the help of the bandits Magnus, Celer,
and Bubalus, who already have been caught and imprisoned.”</p>

<p>51.&nbsp; I may say too that he often gave oracles to
barbarians, when anyone put a question in his native language, in Syrian or in
Celtic; since he readily found strangers in the city who belonged to the same
nation as his questioners. That is why the time between the presentation of the scrolls and the delivery of
the oracle was long, so that in the interval the questions might be unsealed at leisure without risk and men might be found
who would be able to translate them fully. Of this sort was the response
given to the Scythian:</p>

<p align="center">“Morphen eubargoulis eis skian chnechikrage
leipsei phaos.” <sup>40</sup></p>

<p>53.&nbsp; Let me also tell you a few of the responses
that were given to me. When I asked whether Alexander was bald, and sealed the
question carefully and conspicuously, a “nocturnal” oracle was appended:</p>

<p>At another time, I asked a single question in
each of two scrolls under a different name, “What was the poet Homer’s
country?” In one case, misled by my serving-man, who had been asked why he came
and had said, “To request a cure for a pain in the side,” he replied:</p>

      <p align="center">“Cytmis<sup>42 </sup>I bid you apply, combined
with the spume of a charger.”</p>

<p>To the other, since in this case he had been
told that the one who sent it enquired whether it would be better for him to go
to Italy by sea or by land, he gave an answer which had nothing to do with Homer:</p>

<p align="center">“Make not your journey by sea, but travel afoot
by the highway.”</p>

      <p>54.&nbsp; Many such traps, in fact, were set for him by
me and by others. For example, I put a single question, and wrote upon the outside of the scroll, following
      the usual form: “Eight questions from
So-and-so,” using a fictitious name and sending the eight drachmas and
whatever it came to besides.<sup>43 </sup>Relying upon the fee that had been sent and upon
      the inscription on the roll, to the single question: “When will Alexander be caught cheating?” he
sent me eight responses which, as the saying goes, had no connection with earth
or with heaven, but were silly and nonsensical every one.</p>

<p>When he found out about all this afterward, and
also that it was I who was attempting to dissuade Rutilianus from the marriage
and from his great dependence upon the hopes inspired by the shrine, he began
to hate me, as was natural, and to count me a bitter enemy. Once when
Rutilianus asked about me, he replied:</p>

<p align="center">“Low-voiced walks in the dusk are his pleasure,
and impious matings.”</p>

<p>And generally, I was of course the man he most
hated.</p>

<p>55.&nbsp; When he discovered that I had entered the city
and ascertained that I was the Lucian of whom he had heard (I had brought, I
may add, two soldiers with me, a pikeman and a spearman borrowed from the
Governor of Cappadocia, then a friend of mine, to escort me to the sea), he at
once sent for me very politely and with great show of friendliness. When I
went, I found many about him; but I had brought along my two soldiers, as luck
would have it. He
extended me his right hand to kiss, as his custom was with the public; I
clasped it as if to kiss it, and almost crippled it with a right good bite!</p>

<p>The bystanders tried to choke and beat me for
sacrilege; even before that, they had been indignant because I had addressed
him as Alexander and not as “Prophet.” But he mastered himself very handsomely, held them in check, and promised that
he would easily make me tame and would demonstrate Glycon’s worth by showing
that he transformed even bitter foes into friends. Then he removed everybody
and had it out with me, professing to know very well who I was and what advice
I was giving Rutilianus, and saying, “What possessed you to do this to me, when
I can advance you tremendously in his favour?” By that time I was glad to
receive this proffer of friendship, since I saw what a perilous position I had taken up; so, after a little, I
reappeared as his friend, and it seemed quite a miracle to the observers that
my change of heart had been so easily effected.</p>

<p>56.&nbsp; Then, when I decided to sail—it chanced that I
was accompanied only by Xenophon<sup>44</sup> during my visit, as I had previously sent my
father and my family on to Amastris—he sent me many remembrances and presents,
and promised too that he himself would furnish a boat and a crew to transport
me. I considered this a sincere and polite offer; but when I was in
mid-passage, I saw the master in tears, disputing with the sailors, and began to
be very doubtful about the prospects. It was a fact that they had received
orders from Alexander to throw us bodily into the sea. If that had been done,
his quarrel with me would have been settled without ado; but by his tears the
master prevailed upon his crew to do us no harm. “For sixty years, as you see,”
said he to me, “I have led a blameless and God-fearing life, and I should not
wish, at this age and with a wife and children, to stain my hands with murder;” and he explained for what purpose
he had taken us aboard, and what orders had been given by Alexander. [57]&nbsp; He set us
ashore at Aegiali (which noble Homer mentions<sup>45</sup>), and then they went back again.</p>

      <p>There I found some men from the Bosporus who
were voyaging along the coast. They were going as ambassadors from King Eupator
to Bithynia, to bring the yearly contribution.<sup>46 </sup>I told them of the
peril in which we had been, found them courteous, was taken aboard their
vessel, and won safely through to Amastris, after coming so close to losing my
life.</p>

<p>Thereupon I myself began to prepare for battle
with him, and to employ every resource in my desire to pay him back. Even
before his attempt upon me, I detested him and held him in bitter enmity on
account of the vileness of his character. So I undertook to prosecute him, and
had many associ­ates, particularly the followers of Timocrates, the philosopher
from Heraclea. But the then governor of Bithynia and Pontus, Avitus,<sup>47</sup> checked
me, all but beseeching and imploring me to leave off, because out of good will
to Rutilianus he could not, he said, punish Alexander even if he should find
him clearly guilty of crime. In that way my effort was thwarted, and I left off
exhibiting misplaced zeal before a judge who was in that state of mind.<sup>48</sup></p>

<p>58.&nbsp; Was it not also a great piece of impudence on
the part of Alexander that he should petition the Emperor to change the name of
Abonoteichus and call it Ionopolis, and to strike a new coin bearing on one
side the likeness of Glycon and on the other that of Alexander, wearing the
fillets of his grand­father Asclepius and holding the falchion of his maternal
ancestor Perseus?<sup>49</sup></p>

      <p>59.&nbsp; In spite of his prediction in an oracle that he
was fated to live a hundred and fifty years and then die by a stroke of
lightning, he met a most wretched end before reaching the age of seventy, in a
manner that befitted a son of Podaleirius ; <sup>50</sup> for his leg became mortified
quite to the groin and was infested with maggots. it was then that his baldness
was detected when because of the pain he let the doctors foment his head, which they could not. have done unless his wig had been removed.</p>

<p>60.&nbsp; Such was the conclusion of Alexander’s
spectacular career, and such the <i>denouement
</i>of the whole play; being as it was, it resembled an act of Providence,
although it came about by chance. It was inevitable, too, that he should have
funeral games worthy of his career—that a contest for the shrine should arise.
The foremost of his fellow-conspirators and impostors referred it to Rutilianus
to decide which of them should be given the preference, should succeed to the
shrine, and should be crowned with the fillet of priest and prophet. Paetus was
one of them, a physician by profession, a greybeard, who conducted himself in a
way that befitted neither a physician nor a greybeard. But Rutilianus, the
umpire, sent them off unfilleted, keeping the post of prophet for the master
after his departure from this life.</p>

<p>61.&nbsp; This, my friend, is but a little out of a great
deal; I have thought fit to set it down as a specimen, not only to pleasure you
as an associate and friend whom above all others I hold in admiration for your
wisdom, your love of truth, the gentleness and reasonableness of your ways,
the peacefulness of your life, and your courtesy toward all whom you encounter,
but mostly—and this will give greater pleasure to you also—to right the wrongs
of Epicurus, a man truly saintly and divine in his nature, who alone truly
discerned right ideals and handed them down, who proved himself the liberator
of all who sought his converse. I think too that to its readers the writing
will seem to have some usefulness, refuting as it does certain falsehoods and
confirming certain truths in the minds of all men of sense.</p>

      <p class="small">1 The scholiast thinks this Celsus the writer
of the <i>True Word, </i>an attack upon Christianity, to which Origen replied
in his eight books <i>contra Celsum. </i>He is certainly identical with the man
whom Origen himself believed to be the author of that work, who, he says, was
an Epicurean living under Hadrian and the Antonines, author also of a treatise
against sorcery <i>(vide </i>c. 21 and note). And the <i>True
Word </i>itself, a large part of which is preserved in Origen, seems to have
been written about A. D. 180. But as Origen is not sure who wrote it, and as it
is considered Platonic rather than Epicurean in character, the prevailing
opinion is that its author is not the Celsus of Lucian, but an otherwise
unknown Platonist of the same name and date.</p>

      <p class="small">11 Proverbial for cheap trickery. Artemidorus <i>(Dream-book</i>1, 69) says that “if you dream of Pythagoreans,
      physiognomonics, astragaloinants, tyromants, gyromants, <i>coscinomants, </i>morphoscopes,
chiroscopes, lecanomants, or necyomants, you must consider all that they say
false and unreliable; for their trades are such. They do not know even a
little bit about prophecy, but fleece their patrons by charlatanism and fraud.”
Oneiromants may of course be trusted!</p>

<p class="small">The few allusions to coscinomancy in the
ancients give no clue to the method used. As practised in the sixteenth—
seventeenth century, to detect thieves, disclose one’s future wife, etc., the
sieve was either suspended by a string or more commonly balanced on the top of
a pair of tongs set astride the joined middle fingers of the two hands (or of
two persons); then, after an incantation, a list of names was repeated, and the
one upon which the sieve stirred was the one indicated by fate. Or the sieve,
when suspended, might be set spinning; and then the name it stopped on was
designated. See, in particular, Johannes Praetorius, <i>de Coscinomantia, Oder
vom Sieb-Lauffe, </i>etc., Curiae Variscorum, 1677.</p>

<p class="small">12&nbsp; Podaleirius and his brother Machaon, the
Homeric healers <i>(Iliad </i>11, 833), were sons of
Asclepius and lived in Tricca (now Trikkala), Thessaly. According to the <i>Sack
of Ilium </i>(Evelyn-White, <i>Hesiod, </i>p. 524) Machaon specialized in
surgery, Podaleirius in diagnosis and general practice.</p>

      <p class="small">13&nbsp; Since in the Greek notation numbers are
designated by letters, this combination (1, 30, <i>5, </i>60) is <i>ALEX </i>(alex).

rival might steal his thunder if he were not more specific: at all events the

<p class="small">39&nbsp; Democritus of Abdera is adduced as a typical
hard-headed sceptic; see above, c. 17, and the <i>Lover of Lies</i>, 32 (vol.
iii, p.369).</p>

<p class="small">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="small">40&nbsp; Of uncertain meaning, and perhaps corrupt.</p>

<p class="small">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="small">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="small">41 In failing to submit this to
the official interpreters, Lucian lost a priceless opportunity.</p>

<p class="small">42 Alexander’s nostrum; cf c. 22.</p>

<p class="small">43 Since the price of each oracle was one
drachma, two obols, the indefinite plus was sixteen obols, or 2dr. 4 obols.</p>

<p class="small">45&nbsp; <i>Iliad</i>, 2, 855.</p>

<p class="small">46.&nbsp; Tiberius Julius Eupator succeeded Rhoemetalces as
King of the (Cimmerian) Bosporus, on the Tauric Chersonese; its capital was
Panticapaeum (Kertch).&nbsp; The period of his reign is about A.D.
154-171.&nbsp; At this time the kingdom seems to have been paying tribute to the
Scythians annually as well as to the Empire (<i>Toxaris</i>, 44).</p>

<p class="small">47  L.
Lollianus Avitus, consul A.D. 144, proconsul Africae <i>ca. </i>156, praeses Bithyniae 165.</p>

<p class="small">48  Of
course Lucian’s case, as it stood, was weak, as Avitus tactfully hinted. But
this does not excuse Avitus. The chances of securing enough evidence to convict
Alexander in a Roman court were distinctly good, and fear of Alexander’s
influence is the only reasonable explanation of the failure to proceed.</p>

<p class="small">49&nbsp; The request was granted, at least in part.&nbsp;
Beginning with the reign of Verus, the legends IONOPOLEITON and GLYKON appear on
the coins; and the continue to bear the representation of a snake with human head
to the middle of the third century (Head, <i>Hist. Numm.,
</i>432, Cumont <i>l.c.,
</i>p. 42). The modern
name Inéboli is a corruption of Ionopolis.</p>

<p class="small">50&nbsp;  As son
of Podaleirius, it was fitting, thinks Lucian, that his leg <i>(poda-) </i>should be affected.</p>
