3:1/4:31  In the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar,<br> 
         Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea,<br> 
	Jesus descended [out of heaven] into Capernaum, a city in Galilee, <br>
	and was teaching [in the synagogue] on the Sabbath days; <br>
	And they were astonished at his doctrine,<br> <A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert1.html#AM72">Adv.Marc.iv.7 </A> <br>
	for his word was in authority. <br>
33 	 And in the synagogue there was a man,which had a spirit of an unclean devil, <br>
	and cried out with a loud voice, saying, <br>
34  	Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus ?<br> 
	art thou come to destroy us?  I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. <br><A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert1.html#AM73">Adv.Marc.iv.7</A><br>
35  	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <br>
	Hold thy peace, and come out of him. <br>
	And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, <br>
	he came out of him, and hurt him not. <br>
36  	And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, <br>
	What a word is this! <br>
	for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, <br>
	and they come out. <br>
37  	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about. <br>

4: 16  	And he came to Nazareth,<br>
	and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, <br>
	and sat down. <br>
21  	And he began to speak to them, <br>
	and all wondered at the words which proceeded out of his mouth. <br>
23  	And he said unto them, <br>
	Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, <br>
	Physician, heal thyself:  whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, <br> 
	do also here in thy country. <br>
<p>Zahn omits - relocated to 17:19:
<p>[25  But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, <br>
	when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, <br>
	when great famine was throughout all the land; <br>
26  	But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, <br> 
	unto a woman that was a widow. <br>
27  	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; <br> 
	and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.] <br>
<p>28  	And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, <br>
29  	And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, <br>
	and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, <br>
	that they might cast him down headlong. <br>
30  	But he passing through the midst of them went his way. <br>
<p>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="Sun">At the Setting of the Sun</A></B></CENTER>
<p>40  	Now when the sun was setting, <br>
	all they that had any sick with divers diseases  brought them unto him; <br>
	and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <br>
41  	And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, <br>
	 Thou art the Son of God.<br><A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert1.html#AM82">Adv.Marc.iv.8 </A><br>
[-41c]	And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak. <br>	
42  	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:<br><A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert1.html#AM83">Adv.Marc.iv.8</A><br> 
	and the people sought him, <br>
	and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. <br>
43  	And he said unto them, <br>
	I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: <br>
	for therefore am I sent. <br>
44  	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. <br>
<p>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="Lake">The Lake of Gennesaret</A></B></CENTER>
<p>5: 1 And it came to pass, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, <br>
2  	And saw two ships standing by the lake: <br>
	but the fishermen were gone out of them, <br>
	and were washing their nets. <br>
3  	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, <br>
	and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. <br>
	And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. <br>
4  	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <br>
	Launch out into the deep, <br>
	and let down your nets for a draught. <br>
5  	And Simon answering said unto him, <br>
	Teacher, we have toiled all the night, <br>
	and have taken nothing: <br>
	nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. <br>
6  	And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: <br>
	and their net brake. <br>
7  	And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, <br>
	that they should come and help them. <br>
	And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. <br>
8  	When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, <br>
	Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. <br>
9  	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, <br>
	at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: <br>
10  	And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, <br>
	which were partners with Simon. <br>
	And Jesus said unto Simon, <br>
	Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men alive.<br><A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert1.html#AM91">Adv.Marc.iv.9</A><br>

12 	And it came to pass, behold a man full of leprosy:<br>
	who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, <br>
	Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. <br>
13  	And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, <br>
	I will: be thou clean. <br>
	And immediately the leprosy departed from him. <br>
14  	And he charged him to tell no man: <br>
	but go, and shew thyself to the priest, <br>
	and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, <br>

<p>Zahn omits:
<p>[17  And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, <br>
	that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, <br>
	which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: <br>
	and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.] <br><p>
18  	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man that was palsied:<br><A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert2.html#AM101">Adv.Marc.iv.10</A><br>
	and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. <br>
19  	And not finding what way they might bring him in <br>
	because of the multitude, <br>
	they went upon the housetop, <br>
	and let him down through the tiles with his couch <br>
	into the midst before Jesus. <br>
20  	And seeing their faith, he said unto him, <br>
	Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. <br>
21  	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, <br> 
	Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? <br>
	Who can forgive sins, but God alone? <br>
22  	But when Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and  said unto them, <br>
	What reason ye in your hearts? <br>
23  	Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; <br> 
	or to say, Rise up and walk? <br>
24  	But that ye may know that the Son of man <br>
	hath authority upon earth to forgive sins,<br><A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Tert2.html#AM102">Adv.Marc.iv.10</A>;<A HREF="../web/20091019230852/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Epip1.html">Panarion 42</A><br>

	(he said unto the palsied man),  I say unto thee, <br>
	Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. <br>
25  	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, <br>
	and departed to his own house, glorifying God. <br>

29  	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: <br>

30  	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, <br>
	Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? <br>
31  	And Jesus answering said unto them, <br>
	They that are whole need not a physician; <br>
	but they that are sick. <br>
32  	I came not to call the righteous, <br>
	but sinners to repentance. <br>

7  	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, <br>

	to save life, or to destroy it? <br>
10  	And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, <br> 
	Stretch forth thy hand. <br>

<p>7: 1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, <br>

2  	And a certain centurion's servant was sick, and going to die; <br>

	Lord, trouble not thyself: <br>
	for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: <br>
7  	Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: <br>

<p>11  	And it came to pass the day after, that he was going into a city called Nain; <br>
	and many of his disciples were going with him, and a great multitude. <br>
12  	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, <br>
	behold, a dead man was being carried out, <br>
	the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: <br>
	and a considerable multitude of the city was with her. <br>13  And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <br>Weep not. <br>
14  	And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. <br> 
	And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. <br>
15  	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. <br>

	That a great prophet is risen up among us; <br>
	and, That God hath visited his people. <br>

21  	And in that same hour he cured many of  infirmities and plagues <br>
	and of evil spirits; and unto many blind he gave sight. <br>
22  	Then Jesus answering said unto them, <br>
	Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; <br>
	how that the blind see, the lame walk, <br>
	the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, <br>

	Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. <br>

28  	For I say unto you, <br>
	Among those that are born of women  <br>
	a greater prophet than John the Baptist, <br>
	there is none: <br>
	but he that is least in the kingdom of God <br>
	is greater than he. <br>
<p>Zahn omits:
<p>[29  	And all the people, when they heard it, and the publicans, justified God, <br>
	being baptized with the baptism of John. <br>
30  	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God unto themselves, <br>
	being not baptized of him. <br>
31  	And the Lord said, <br>
	Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? <br>
	and to what are they like? <br>
32  	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, <br>
	and calling one to another, and saying, <br>
	We have piped unto you, and ye did not dance; <br>
	we have mourned to you, and ye did not weep. <br>
33  	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; <br>
	and ye say, He hath a demon. <br>
34 	The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, <br>
	Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, <br>
	a friend of publicans and sinners! <br>
