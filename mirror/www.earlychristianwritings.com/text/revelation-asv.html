<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which 
God gave him to show unto his servants, <I>even</I> the things which must 
shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified <I>it</I> by his angel unto his 
servant John; <A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who bare witness of the word of God, and 
of the testimony of Jesus Christ, <I>even</I> of all things that he saw. <A 
name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed is he that readeth, and they 
that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written 
therein: for the time is at hand. <A name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John to the seven churches that are in 
Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; 
and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne; <A name=C1V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and from Jesus 
Christ, <I>who is</I> the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the 
ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our 
sins by his blood; <A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he made us <I>to be</I> a kingdom, 
<I>to be</I> priests unto his God and Father; to him <I>be</I> the glory and the 
dominion for ever and ever. Amen. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and 
every eye shall see him, and they that pierced him; and all the tribes of the 
earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen. <A name=C1V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am the Alpha and 
the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the 
Almighty. <A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I John, your brother and partaker with 
you in tribulation and kingdom and patience <I>which are</I> in Jesus, was in 
the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. 
<A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, 
and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet <A name=C1V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, What thou 
seest, write in a book and send <I>it</I> to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, 
and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto 
Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. <A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I turned to see the voice that 
spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks; <A 
name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and in the midst of the candlesticks 
one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt 
about at the breasts with a golden girdle. <A name=C1V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his head and 
his hair were white as white wool, <I>white</I> as snow; and his eyes were as a 
flame of fire; <A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and his feet like unto burnished brass, 
as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many 
waters. <A name=C1V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he had in his right hand seven 
stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his 
countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. <A name=C1V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when I saw him, 
I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear 
not; I am the first and the last, <A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the Living one; and I was dead, and 
behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. <A 
name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Write therefore the things which thou 
sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass 
hereafter; <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the mystery of the seven stars which 
thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars 
are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven 
churches. 
<P>
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To the angel of the church in Ephesus 
write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he 
that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks: <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know thy works, 
and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try 
them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false; 
<A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and thou hast patience and didst bear 
for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. <A name=C2V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I have 
<I>this</I> against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. <A 
name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Remember therefore whence thou art 
fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move 
thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. <A name=C2V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But this thou hast, 
that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. <A 
name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him 
that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the 
Paradise of God. <A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna 
write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived 
<I>again</I>: <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty 
(but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they 
art not, but are a synagogue of Satan. <A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Fear not the things which thou art 
about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, 
that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful 
unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that hath an 
ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh 
shall not be hurt of the second death. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to the angel of the church in 
Pergamum write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword: <A 
name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
know where thou dwellest, <I>even</I> where Satan's throne is; and thou holdest 
fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my 
witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth. <A 
name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I have a few things against thee, 
because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak 
to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed 
to idols, and to commit fornication. <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So hast thou also some that hold the 
teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner. <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Repent therefore; 
or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword 
of my mouth. <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give of 
the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new 
name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it. <A name=C2V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to the angel of 
the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his 
eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass: <A 
name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy 
last works are more than the first. <A name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I have <I>this</I> against thee, 
that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she 
teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things 
sacrificed to idols. <A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I gave her time that she should 
repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication. <A name=C2V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, I cast her 
into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, 
except they repent of her works. <A name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I will kill her children with 
death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and 
hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works. <A 
name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to you I say, to the rest that are 
in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of 
Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden. <A 
name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nevertheless that which ye have, hold 
fast till I come. <A name=C2V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that overcometh, and he that 
keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations: <A 
name=C2V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he shall rule them with a rod of 
iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have 
received of my Father: <A name=C2V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and I will give him the morning star. 
<A name=C2V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. 
<P>
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to the angel of the church in Sardis 
write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven 
stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art 
dead. <A name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be thou watchful, and establish the 
things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine 
perfected before my God. <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Remember therefore how thou hast 
received and didst hear; and keep <I>it</I>, and repent. If therefore thou shalt 
not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come 
upon thee. <A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But thou hast a few names in Sardis that 
did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they 
are worthy. <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed 
in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, 
and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. <A 
name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. <A 
name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is 
holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and none 
shall shut, and that shutteth and none openeth: <A name=C3V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know thy works 
(behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou 
hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name. <A 
name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, I give of the synagogue of 
Satan, of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I 
will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have 
loved thee. <A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because thou didst keep the word of my 
patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, that <I>hour</I> which 
is to come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. <A 
name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown. <A 
name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall 
go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the 
name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven 
from my God, and mine own new name. <A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And to the angel of the church in 
Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the 
beginning of the creation of God: <A name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know thy works, that thou art neither 
cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. <A name=C3V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So because thou art 
lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth. <A

<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, <I>a voice</I> as of a 
trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the 
things which must come to pass hereafter. <A name=C4V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne; <A 
name=C4V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
he that sat <I>was</I> to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and 
<I>there was</I> a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon. 
<A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones <I>I saw</I> four and twenty 
elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold. <A

out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And <I>there 
was</I> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven 
Spirits of God; <A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of glass like a crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the 
throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. <A name=C4V7><FONT

creature <I>was</I> like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the

each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they 
have no rest day and night, saying, 
<P>Holy, holy, holy, <I>is</I> the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is

<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven 
seals. <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming 
with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals 
thereof? <A name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no one in the heaven, or on the 
earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon. <A 
name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look 
thereon: <A name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, 
hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. <A name=C5V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw in the 
midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the 
elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and 
seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. 
<A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. <A name=C5V8><FONT

taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell 
down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, 
which are the prayers of the saints. <A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they sing a new song, saying, 
<P>Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou was 
slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood <I>men</I> of every tribe, and 
tongue, and people, and nation, <A name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and madest them <I>to be</I> unto our 
God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon earth. 
<P><A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the 
number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
<A name=C5V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and 
wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing. 
<P><A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things 
are in them, heard I saying, 
<P>Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, <I>be</I> the 
blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever. 
<P><A name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped. 
<P>
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of 
the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a 
voice of thunder, Come. <A name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw, and behold, a white horse, 
and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he 
came forth conquering, and to conquer. <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he opened the second seal, I 
heard the second living creature saying, Come. <A name=C6V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And another 
<I>horse</I> came forth, a red horse: and to him that sat thereon it was given 
to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another: and there 
was given unto him a great sword. <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he opened the third seal, I 
heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black 
horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. <A name=C6V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard as it 
were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of 
wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil 
and the wine hurt thou not. <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he opened the fourth seal, I 
heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. <A name=C6V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw, and 
behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades 
followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part 
of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the 
wild beasts of the earth. <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw 
underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, 
and for the testimony which they held: <A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they cried with a great voice, 
saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge 
our blood on them that dwell on the earth? <A name=C6V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was given 
them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest 
yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, who 
should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled <I>their course</I>. 
<A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw when he opened the sixth 
seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of 
hair, and the whole moon became as blood; <A name=C6V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the stars of 
the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she 
is shaken of a great wind. <A name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the heaven was removed as a scroll 
when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their 
places. <A name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the kings of the earth, and the 
princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman 
and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; <A 
name=C6V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the 
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: <A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

come; and who is able to stand? 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After his I saw four angels standing at 
the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind 
should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree. <A name=C7V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw another 
angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried 
with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and 
the sea, <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the 
sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their 
foreheads. <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard the number of them that were 
sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the 
children of Israel: 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; 
<P>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Benjamin <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. 
<P><A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things I saw, and behold, a 
great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of 
<I>all</I> tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before 
the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands; <A name=C7V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they cry with a 
great voice, saying, 
<P>Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb. 
<P><A name=C7V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the angels were standing round 
about the throne, and <I>about</I> the elders and the four living creatures; and 
they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, <A 
name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and 
power, and might, <I>be</I> unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. 
<P><A name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of the elders answered, saying 
unto me, These that are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came 
they? <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I say unto him, My lord, thou 
knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come of the great tribulation, 
and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. <A

size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore are they before the throne of 
God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the 
throne shall spread his tabernacle over them. <A name=C7V16><FONT

no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor 
any heat: <A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for the Lamb that is in the midst of 
the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of 
waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. 
<P>
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he opened the seventh seal, 
there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. <A 
name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them 
seven trumpets. <A name=C8V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And another angel came and stood over 
the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, 
that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar 
which was before the throne. <A name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the smoke of the incense, with the 
prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. <A 
name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and 
cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, 
and an earthquake. <A name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the seven angels that had the seven 
trumpets prepared themselves to sound. <A name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the first sounded, and there 
followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: 
and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees 
was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. <A name=C8V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the second angel 
sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the 
sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; <A name=C8V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there died the 
third part of the creatures which were in the sea, <I>even</I> they that had 
life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed. <A name=C8V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the third angel 
sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it 
fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; <A 
name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the name of the star is called 
Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of 
the waters, because they were made bitter. <A name=C8V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the fourth 
angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of 
the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be 
darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night 
in like manner. <A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying 
in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on 
the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who 
are yet to sound. 
<P>
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a 
star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of 
the pit of the abyss. <A name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he opened the pit of the abyss; and 
there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the 
sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. <A 
name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as 
the scorpions of the earth have power. <A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was said unto them that they 
should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any 
tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads. <A 
name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be 
tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when 
it striketh a man. <A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in those days men shall seek death, 
and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth 
from them. <A name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the shapes of the locusts were like 
unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto 
gold, and their faces were as men's faces. <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they had hair as 
the hair of women, and their teeth were as <I>teeth</I> of lions. <A 
name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their 
wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war. <A 
name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they have tails like unto 
scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five 
months. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They have over them as king the angel 
of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek <I>tongue</I> he 
hath the name Apollyon. <A name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The first Woe is past: behold, there 
come yet two Woes hereafter. <A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the sixth angel sounded, and I 
heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God, <A 
name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>one saying to the sixth angel that had 
one trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates. 
<A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the four angels were loosed, that 
had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill 
the third part of men. <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the number of the armies of the 
horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.

vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates <I>as</I> of fire and of 
hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of lions; and out of their mouths 
proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone. <A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

out of their mouths. <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have 
heads; and with them they hurt. <A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they 
should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, 
and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk: <A

down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and 
his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire; <A name=C10V2><FONT

upon the earth; <A name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<I>their voices</I>, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven 
saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. 
<A name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven, <A

and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth 
and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, 
that there shall be delay no longer: <A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished they mystery of God, 
according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets. <A

heaven, <I>I heard it</I> again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book 
which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the 
earth. <A name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and 
eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be 
sweet as honey. <A name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

had eaten it, my belly was made bitter. <A name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them that worship therein. <A name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the 
nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. <A

and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in 
sackcloth. <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their

killed. <A name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power

also their Lord was crucified. <A name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; 
because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth. <A

the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; 
and great fear fell upon them that beheld them. <A name=C11V12><FONT

great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into 
heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. <A name=C11V13><FONT

there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there 
were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were 
affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. <A name=C11V14><FONT

angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, 
<P>The kingdom of the world is become <I>the kingdom</I> of our Lord, and of his 
Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever. 
<P><A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, <A

<P>We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because 
thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign. <A name=C11V18><FONT

were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and 
<I>the time</I> to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the 
saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy 
them that destroy the earth. 
<P><A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and 
there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and 
great hail. 
<P>
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

crown of twelve stars; <A name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered. <A name=C12V3><FONT

another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and 
ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems. <A name=C12V4><FONT

draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: 
and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that 
when she is delivered he may devour her child. <A name=C12V5><FONT

delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of 
iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne. <A

where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a

in heaven: Michael and his angels <I>going forth</I> to war with the dragon; and 
the dragon warred and his angels; <A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

their place found any more in heaven. <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole 
world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him. <A

saying, 
<P>Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the 
authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who 
accuseth them before our God day and night. <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they overcame 
him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their 
testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death. <A name=C12V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore rejoice, 
O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because 
the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a 
short time. 
<P><A name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man 
<I>child</I>. <A name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were given to the woman the 
two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her 
place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the 
face of the serpent. <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the serpent cast out of his mouth 
after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by 
the stream. <A name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the earth helped the woman, and 
the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out 
of his mouth. <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the dragon waxed wroth with the 
woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the 
commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus: 
<P>
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, 
and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy. <A

a leopard, and his feet were as <I>the feet</I> of a bear, and his mouth as the 
mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great 
authority. <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And <I>I saw</I> one of his heads as 
though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the 
whole earth wondered after the beast; <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they worshipped the dragon, because 
he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who 
is like unto the beast? And who is able to war with him? <A name=C13V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there was given 
to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him 
authority to continue forty and two months. <A name=C13V6><FONT

mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, 
<I>even</I> them that dwell in the heaven. <A name=C13V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was given 
unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given 
to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. <A

into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword 
must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. <A

size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw another beast coming up out 
of the earth; and he had two horns like unto lamb, and he spake as a dragon. <A

the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to 
worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed. <A name=C13V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he doeth great 
signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth 
in the sight of men. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he deceiveth them that dwell on 
the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of 
the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an 
image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived. <A

give breath to it, <I>even</I> to the image to the breast, that the image of the 
beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image 
of the beast should be killed. <A name=C13V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead; <A name=C13V17><FONT

<P>
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw as it 
were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from 
the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the 
sea of glass, having harps of God. <A name=C15V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they sing the song of Moses the 
servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 
<P>Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and 
true are thy ways, thou King of the ages. <A name=C15V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who shall not fear, 
O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall 
come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest. 
<P><A name=C15V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these things I saw, and the 
temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: <A 
name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there came out from the temple the 
seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with <I>precious</I> stone, 
pure <I>and</I> bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles. <A 
name=C15V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of the four living creatures 
gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who 
liveth for ever and ever. <A name=C15V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the temple was filled with smoke 
from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the 
temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished. 
<P>
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard a great voice out of the 
temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the 
wrath of God into the earth. <A name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the first went, and poured out his 
bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that 
had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image. <A name=C16V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the second 
poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and 
every living soul died, <I>even</I> the things that were in the sea. <A 
name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the third poured out his bowl into 
the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood. <A 
name=C16V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard the angel of the waters 
saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou 
didst thus judge: <A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they poured out the blood of the 
saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are 
worthy. <A name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O 
Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. <A 
name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the fourth poured out his bowl upon 
the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire. <A name=C16V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And men were 
scorched men with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the 
power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory. <A 
name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the fifth poured out his bowl upon 
the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their 
tongues for pain, <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they blasphemed the God of heaven 
because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works. <A 
name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the sixth poured out his bowl upon 
the great river, the <I>river</I> Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, 
that the way might by made ready for the kings that <I>come</I> from the 
sunrising. <A name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw <I>coming</I> out of the 
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of 
the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs: <A name=C16V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they are 
spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole 
world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the 
Almighty. <A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is 
he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walked naked, and they see 
his shame.) <A name=C16V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they gathered them together into 
the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon. <A name=C16V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the seventh 
poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the 
temple, from the throne, saying, It is done: <A name=C16V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there were 
lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as 
was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. 
<A name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the great city was divided into 
three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was 
remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the 
fierceness of his wrath. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And every island fled away, and the 
mountains were not found. <A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And great hail, <I>every stone</I> 
about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men 
blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is 
exceeding great. 
<P>
<P><A name=C17V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came one of the seven angels 
that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show 
thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters; <A 
name=C17V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>with whom the kings of the earth 
committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with 
the wine of her fornication. <A name=C17V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he carried me away in the Spirit 
into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full 
of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. <A name=C17V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the woman was 
arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and 
pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean 
things of her fornication, <A name=C17V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and upon her forehead a name written, 
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF 
THE EARTH. <A name=C17V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw the woman drunken with the 
blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw 
her, I wondered with a great wonder. <A name=C17V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel said unto me, Wherefore 
didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast 
that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. <A 
name=C17V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The beast that thou sawest was, and is 
not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And 
they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, <I>they</I> whose name hath not been 
written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold 
the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come. <A name=C17V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Here is the mind 
that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman 
sitteth: <A name=C17V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they are seven kings; the five are 
fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must 
continue a little while. <A name=C17V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the beast that was, and is not, is 
himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition. <A 
name=C17V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the ten horns that thou sawest are 
ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as 
kings, with the beast, for one hour. <A name=C17V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These have one mind, and they give 
their power and authority unto the beast. <A name=C17V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>These shall war 
against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and 
King of kings; and they <I>also shall overcome</I> that are with him, called and 
chosen and faithful. <A name=C17V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto me, The waters which 
thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, 
and tongues. <A name=C17V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the ten horns which thou sawest, 
and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and 
naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire. <A 
name=C17V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For God did put in their hearts to do 
his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, 
until the words of God should be accomplished. <A name=C17V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the woman whom 
thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. 
<P>
<P><A name=C18V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After these things I saw another angel 
coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened 
with his glory. <A name=C18V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cried with a mighty voice, 
saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of 
demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and 
hateful bird. <A name=C18V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For by the wine of the wrath of her 
fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed 
fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of 
her wantonness. <A name=C18V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard another voice from heaven, 
saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her 
sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: <A name=C18V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for her sins have 
reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. <A

size=-1><SUP>18:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Render unto her even as she rendered, 
and double <I>unto her</I> the double according to her works: in the cup which 
she mingled, mingle unto her double. <A name=C18V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How much soever she glorified herself, 
and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her 
heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning. <A 
name=C18V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore in one day shall her plagues 
come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with 
fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her. <A name=C18V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the kings of 
the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and 
wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning, <A 
name=C18V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>standing afar off for the fear of her 
torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one 
hour is thy judgment come. <A name=C18V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the merchants of the earth weep 
and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more; <A 
name=C18V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>merchandise of gold, and silver, and 
precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; 
and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most 
precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; <A name=C18V13><FONT

spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine 
flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and <I>merchandise</I> of horses and 
chariots and slaves; and souls of men. <A name=C18V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the fruits which thy soul lusted 
after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are 
perished from thee, and <I>men</I> shall find them no more at all. <A 
name=C18V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The merchants of these things, who 
were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping 
and mourning; <A name=C18V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she 
that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and 
precious stone and pearl! <A name=C18V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for in an hour so great riches is made 
desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any wither, and 
mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off, <A 
name=C18V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and cried out as they looked upon the 
smoke of her burning, saying, What <I>city</I> is like the great city? <A 
name=C18V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they cast dust on their heads, and 
cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that 
had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in 
one hour is she made desolate. <A name=C18V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye 
saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on 
her. <A name=C18V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a strong angel took up a stone as 
it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty 
fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at 
all. <A name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the voice of harpers and minstrels 
and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no 
craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the 
voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee; <A name=C18V23><FONT

lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of 
the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the 
princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived. <A 
name=C18V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in her was found the blood of 
prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth. 
<P>
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,

<P><A name=C19V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever. <A name=C19V4><FONT

twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that

<P><A name=C19V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

thunders, saying,

be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the

unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright <I>and</I> pure: 
for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. 
<P><A name=C19V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

me, These are true words of God. <A name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant 
with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; 
for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. <A name=C19V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw the 
heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called 
Faithful and True; and in righteous he doth judge and make war. <A

which no one knoweth but he himself. <A name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white <I>and</I> pure. <A

sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them 
with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath 
of God, the Almighty. <A name=C19V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived 
them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: 
they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone: <A

size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he laid hold on the dragon, the old 
serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, <A 
name=C20V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and cast him into the abyss, and shut 
<I>it</I>, and sealed <I>it</I> over him, that he should deceive the nations no 
more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed 
for a little time. <A name=C20V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon 
them, and judgment was given unto them: and <I>I saw</I> the souls of them that 
had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such 
as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon 
their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a 
thousand years. <A name=C20V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The rest of the dead lived not until 
the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection. <A 
name=C20V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed and holy is he that hath part 
in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they 
shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand 
years. <A name=C20V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the thousand years are 
finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, <A name=C20V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and shall come 
forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and 
Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of 
the sea. <A name=C20V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went up over the breadth of 
the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and 
fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them. <A name=C20V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the devil that 
deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the 
beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever 
and ever. <A name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw a great white throne, and 
him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and 
there was found no place for them. <A name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw the dead, the great and the 
small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was 
opened, which is <I>the book</I> of life: and the dead were judged out of the 
things which were written in the books, according to their works. <A 
name=C20V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the sea gave up the dead that were 
in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were 
judged every man according to their works. <A name=C20V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And death and 
Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, <I>even</I> the 
lake of fire. <A name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if any was not found written in 
the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire. 
<P>
<P><A name=C21V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: 
for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no 
more. <A name=C21V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, 
coming down out of heaven of God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. 
<A name=C21V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I heard a great voice out of the 
throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell 
with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, 
<I>and be</I> their God: <A name=C21V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he shall wipe away every tear from 
their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor 
crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away. <A 
name=C21V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that sitteth on the throne said, 
Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful 
and true. <A name=C21V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto me, They are come to 
pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto 
him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. <A 
name=C21V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall 
be my son. <A name=C21V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But for the fearful, and unbelieving, 
and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, 
and all liars, their part <I>shall be</I> in the lake that burneth with fire and 
brimstone; which is the second death. <A name=C21V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came one of the seven angels 
who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he 
spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the 
Lamb. <A name=C21V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he carried me away in the Spirit 
to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down 
out of heaven from God, <A name=C21V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having the glory of God: her light was 
like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal: <A 
name=C21V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having a wall great and high; having 
twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which 
are <I>the names</I> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: <A 
name=C21V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>on the east were three gates; and on 
the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three 
gates. <A name=C21V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the wall of the city had twelve 
foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <A 
name=C21V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that spake with me had for a 
measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall 
thereof. <A name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the city lieth foursquare, and the 
length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the 
reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height 
thereof are equal. <A name=C21V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he measured the wall thereof, a 
hundred and forty and four cubits, <I>according to</I> the measure of a man, 
that is, of an angel. <A name=C21V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the building of the wall thereof 
was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. <A 
name=C21V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The foundations of the wall of the 
city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was 
jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; <A 
name=C21V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, 
sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the 
tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. <A 
name=C21V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the twelve gates were twelve 
pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the 
city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. <A name=C21V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I saw no 
temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple 
thereof. <A name=C21V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the city hath no need of the sun, 
neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and 
the lamp thereof <I>is</I> the Lamb. <A name=C21V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the nations shall walk amidst the 
light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. <A 
name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the gates thereof shall in no wise 
be shut by day (for there shall be no night there): <A name=C21V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they shall 
bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it: <A name=C21V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there shall in 
no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a 
lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life. 
<P>
<P><A name=C22V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he showed me a river of water of 
life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, <A 
name=C22V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in 
the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was 
the tree of life, bearing twelve <I>manner of</I> fruits, yielding its fruit 
every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. <A 
name=C22V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there shall be no curse any more: 
and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall 
serve him; <A name=C22V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they shall see his face; and his 
name <I>shall be</I> on their foreheads. <A name=C22V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there shall be night no more; and 
they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give 
them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever. <A name=C22V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of 
the prophets, sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must 
shortly come to pass. <A name=C22V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is 
he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. <A name=C22V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I John am he 
that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to 
worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. <A 
name=C22V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto me, See thou do it 
not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and 
with them that keep the words of this book: worship God. <A name=C22V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto 
me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand. 
<A name=C22V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that is unrighteous, let him do 
unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and 
he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let 
him be made holy still. <A name=C22V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward 
is with me, to render to each man according as his work is. <A name=C22V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am the Alpha and 
the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. <A 
name=C22V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed are they that wash their 
robes, that they may have the right <I>to come</I> to the tree of life, and my 
enter in by the gates into the city. <A name=C22V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Without are the dogs, and the 
sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every 
one that loveth and maketh a lie. <A name=C22V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I Jesus have sent mine angel to 
testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring 
of David, the bright, the morning star. <A name=C22V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Spirit and the bride say, 
Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him 
come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely. <A name=C22V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I testify unto 
every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall 
add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this 
book: <A name=C22V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and if any man shall take away from 
the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the 
tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book. <A 
name=C22V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He who testifieth these things saith, 
Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus. <A name=C22V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The grace of the 
Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
