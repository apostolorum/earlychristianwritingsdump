<H1>The Gospel According to St. Luke </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to 
draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, 
<A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even as they delivered them unto us, who 
from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, <A 
name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>it 
seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from 
the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus; <A 
name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that 
thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast 
instructed. <A name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was in the days of Herod, king of 
Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a 
wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. <A name=C1V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were both 
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord 
blameless. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they had no child, because that 
Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <I>now</I> well stricken in years. <A 
name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now 
it came to pass, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order 
of his course, <A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>according to the custom of the priest's 
office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <A 
name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the whole multitude of the people 
were praying without at the hour of incense. <A name=C1V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there appeared 
unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of altar of incense. <A 
name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Zacharias was troubled when he saw 
<I>him</I>, and fear fell upon him. <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, 
Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear 
thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. <A name=C1V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And thou shalt have 
joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. <A name=C1V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he shall be 
great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and 
he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. <A 
name=C1V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And many of the children of Israel 
shall be turn unto the Lord their God. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he shall go before his face in the 
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, 
and the disobedient <I>to walk</I> in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for 
the Lord a people prepared <I>for him</I>. <A name=C1V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Zacharias said 
unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well 
stricken in years. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel answering said unto him, 
I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto 
thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. <A name=C1V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, thou 
shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall 
come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in 
their season. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the people were waiting for 
Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple. <A 
name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he came out, he could not 
speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and 
he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb. <A name=C1V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his 
house. <A name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these days Elisabeth his wife 
conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, <A name=C1V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thus hath the Lord 
done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon <I>me</I>, to take away my 
reproach among men. <A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in the sixth month the angel 
Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <A 
name=C1V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to 
a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and 
the virgin's name was Mary. <A name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came in unto her, and said, 
Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord <I>is</I> with thee. <A 
name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But she was greatly troubled at the 
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. <A 
name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, 
Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. <A name=C1V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, thou 
shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name 
JESUS. <A name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He shall be great, and shall be called 
the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his 
father David: <A name=C1V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he shall reign over the house of 
Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. <A name=C1V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary said unto 
the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? <A name=C1V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel 
answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power 
of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is 
begotten shall be called the Son of God. <A name=C1V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, 
she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with 
her that was called barren. <A name=C1V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For no word from God shall be void of 
power. <A name=C1V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of 
the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 
<A name=C1V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary arose in these days and went 
into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah; <A name=C1V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and entered into 
the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth. <A name=C1V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; 
and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; <A name=C1V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and she lifted up 
her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed <I>art</I> thou among women, and 
blessed <I>is</I> the fruit of thy womb. <A name=C1V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And whence is this to me, that the 
mother of my Lord should come unto me? <A name=C1V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For behold, when the voice of thy 
salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. <A 
name=C1V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And blessed <I>is</I> she that 
believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken 
to her from the Lord. <A name=C1V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary said, 
<P>&nbsp;My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my 
Saviour. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he hath looked upon the low estate 
of his handmaid: 
<P>&nbsp;For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he that is mighty hath done to me 
great things; 
<P>&nbsp;And holy is his name. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his mercy is unto generations and 
generations 
<P>&nbsp;On them that fear him. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He hath showed strength with his arm; 
<P>&nbsp;He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He hath put down princes from 
<I>their</I> thrones, 
<P>&nbsp;And hath exalted them of low degree. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The hungry he hath filled with good 
things; 
<P>&nbsp;And the rich he hath sent empty away. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He hath given help to Israel his 
servant, 
<P>&nbsp;That he might remember mercy 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(As he spake unto our fathers) 
<P>&nbsp;Toward Abraham and his seed for ever. 
<P><A name=C1V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary abode with her about three 
months, and returned unto her house. <A name=C1V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Elisabeth's time was fulfilled that 
she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. <A name=C1V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And her neighbors 
and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and 
they rejoiced with her. <A name=C1V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass on the eighth day, 
that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him 
Zacharias, after the name of the father. <A name=C1V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his mother answered and said, Not 
so; but he shall be called John. <A name=C1V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto her, There is none 
of thy kindred that is called by this name. <A name=C1V62><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they made signs 
to his father, what he would have him called. <A name=C1V63><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he asked for a 
writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. <A 
name=C1V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his mouth was opened immediately, 
and his tongue <I>loosed</I>, and he spake, blessing God. <A name=C1V65><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And fear came on 
all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad 
throughout all the hill country of Judaea. <A name=C1V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all that heard 
them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the 
hand of the Lord was with him. <A name=C1V67><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his father Zacharias was filled 
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:68</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed <I>be</I> the Lord, the God of 
Israel; 
<P>&nbsp;For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V69><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:69</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And hath raised up a horn of salvation 
for us 
<P>&nbsp;In the house of his servant David 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V70><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(As he spake by the mouth of his holy 
prophets that have been from of old), 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Salvation from our enemies, and from 
the hand of all that hate us; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V72><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:72</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To show mercy towards, our fathers, 
<P>&nbsp;And to remember his holy covenant; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V73><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:73</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The oath which he spake unto Abraham 
our father, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V74><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:74</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To grant unto us that we being 
delivered out of the hand of our enemies 
<P>&nbsp;Should serve him without fear, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V75><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled. 
<A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This was the first enrolment made when 
Quirinius was governor of Syria. <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

one to his own city. <A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, 
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called 
Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; <A name=C2V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to enrol himself 
with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child. <A name=C2V6><FONT

while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. <A 
name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, 
and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. <A 
name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch 
by night over their flock. <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And an angel of the Lord stood by them, 
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. <A 
name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the angel said unto them, Be not 
afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all 
the people: <A name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for there is born to you this day in 
the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. <A name=C2V12><FONT

the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying 
in a manger. <A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And suddenly there was with the angel a 
multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Glory to God in the highest, 
<P>&nbsp;And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased. 
<P><A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, when the angels 
went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now 
go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord 
hath made known unto us. <A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came with haste, and found 
both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. <A name=C2V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they saw 
it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this 
child. <A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all that heard it wondered at the 
things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. <A name=C2V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Mary kept all 
these sayings, pondering them in her heart. <A name=C2V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the shepherds 
returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and 
seen, even as it was spoken unto them. <A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when eight days were fulfilled for 
circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel 
before he was conceived in the womb. <A name=C2V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the days of their purification 
according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, 
to present him to the Lord <A name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(as it is written in the law of the 
Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord), <A

size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to offer a sacrifice according to 
that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young 
pigeons. <A name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, there was a man in 
Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking 
for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. <A 
name=C2V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it had been revealed unto him by 
the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's 
Christ. <A name=C2V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came in the Spirit into the 
temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do 
concerning him after the custom of the law, <A name=C2V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>then he received 
him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now lettest thou thy servant depart, 
Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;According to thy word, in peace; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which thou hast prepared before the 
face of all peoples; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;And the glory of thy people Israel. 
<P><A name=C2V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his father and his mother were 
marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him; <A name=C2V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Simeon blessed 
them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this <I>child</I> is set for the 
falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken 
against; <A name=C2V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yea and a sword shall pierce through 
thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. <A 
name=C2V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, 
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having 
lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, <A name=C2V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and she had been a 
widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, 
worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day. <A name=C2V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And coming up at 
that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were 
looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. <A name=C2V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had accomplished all 
things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, 
to their own city Nazareth. <A name=C2V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the child grew, and waxed strong, 
filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. <A name=C2V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his parents 
went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover. <A name=C2V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was 
twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast; <A 
name=C2V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they had fulfilled the days, 
as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his 
parents knew it not; <A name=C2V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but supposing him to be in the company, 
they went a day's journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and 
acquaintance: <A name=C2V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they found him not, they 
returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him. <A name=C2V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, after three days 
they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing 
them, and asking them questions: <A name=C2V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and all that heard him were amazed at 
his understanding and his answers. <A name=C2V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they saw him, they were 
astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? 
behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing. <A name=C2V49><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father's 
house? <A name=C2V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they understood not the saying 
which he spake unto them. <A name=C2V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went down with them, and came to 
Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all <I>these</I> 
sayings in her heart. <A name=C2V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and 
stature, and in favor with God and men.

of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being 
tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea 
and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, <A name=C3V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in the 
highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of 
Zacharias in the wilderness. <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came into all the region round 
about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins; <A 
name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>as 
it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one 
crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths 
straight. <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every valley shall be filled, And every 
mountain and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, 
And the rough ways smooth; <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

God. <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said therefore to the multitudes that 
went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee 
from the wrath to come? <A name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of 
repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our 
father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up 
children unto Abraham. <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And even now the axe also lieth at the 
root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is 
hewn down, and cast into the fire. <A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the multitudes asked him, saying, 
What then must we do? <A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered and said unto them, He 
that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath 
food, let him do likewise. <A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came also publicans to be 
baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do? <A name=C3V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you. <A name=C3V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And soldiers also 
asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Extort from 
no man by violence, neither accuse <I>any one</I> wrongfully; and be content 
with your wages. <A name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as the people were in expectation, 
and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the 
Christ; <A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John answered, saying unto them all, I 
indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the 
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the 
Holy Spirit and <I>in</I> fire: <A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to 
cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the 
chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. <A name=C3V18><FONT

exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people; <A

size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved 
by him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod 
had done, <A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>added this also to them all, that he 
shut up John in prison. <A name=C3V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the 
heaven was opened, <A name=C3V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 
<A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him 
on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, 
cast thyself down from hence: <A name=C4V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee: 
<P><A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and, 
<P>&nbsp;On their hands they shall bear thee up, 
<P>&nbsp;Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
<P><A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answering said unto him, It 
is said, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God. 
<P><A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the devil had completed every 
temptation, he departed from him for a season. 
<P><A name=C4V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus returned in the power of the 
Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region 
round about. <A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he taught in their synagogues, 
being glorified of all. 
<P><A name=C4V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came to Nazareth, where he had 
been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the 
sabbath day, and stood up to read. <A name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was delivered unto him the 
book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it 
was written, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
<P>&nbsp;Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor: 
<P>&nbsp;He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, 
<P>&nbsp;And recovering of sight to the blind, 
<P>&nbsp;To set at liberty them that are bruised, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>To proclaim the acceptable year of the 
Lord. 
<P><A name=C4V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he closed the book, and gave it 
back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were 
fastened on him. <A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he began to say unto them, To-day 
hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears. <A name=C4V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all bare him 
witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: 
and they said, Is not this Joseph's son? <A name=C4V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Doubtless ye 
will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard 
done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country. <A name=C4V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Verily 
I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. <A name=C4V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But of a truth I 
say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the 
heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine 
over all the land; <A name=C4V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and unto none of them was Elijah sent, 
but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. <A 
name=C4V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were many lepers in Israel in 
the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman 
the Syrian. <A name=C4V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were all filled with wrath in 
the synagogue, as they heard these things; <A name=C4V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they rose up, 
and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill 
whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. <A 
name=C4V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he passing through the midst of 
them went his way. <A name=C4V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came down to Capernaum, a city 
of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day: <A name=C4V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they were 
astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority. <A name=C4V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in the 
synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried 
out with a loud voice, <A name=C4V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus 
thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy 
One of God. <A name=C4V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy 
peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, 
he came out of him, having done him no hurt. <A name=C4V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And amazement came 
upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? 
for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come 
out. <A name=C4V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there went forth a rumor concerning 
him into every place of the region round about. <A name=C4V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he rose up from 
the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother 
was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her. <A 
name=C4V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he stood over her, and rebuked the 
fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them. <A 
name=C4V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the sun was setting, all they 
that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his 
hands on every one of them, and healed them. <A name=C4V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And demons also 
came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And 
rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the 
Christ. <A name=C4V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was day, he came out and 
went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto 
him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. <A 
name=C4V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said unto them, I must preach 
the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore 
was I sent. <A name=C4V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was preaching in the synagogues 
of Galilee. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it came to pass, while the multitude 
pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of 
Gennesaret; <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he saw two boats standing by the 
lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. <A 
name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a 
little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat. 
<A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had left speaking, he said 
unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. <A 
name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at 
thy word I will let down the nets. <A name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had done this, they 
inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking; <A 
name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and 
help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 
<A name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell 
down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. <A 
name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which 
they had taken; <A name=C5V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and so were also James and John, sons 
of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; 
from henceforth thou shalt catch men. <A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had brought their boats 
to land, they left all, and followed him. <A name=C5V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when 
he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, 
thou canst make me clean. <A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he stretched forth his hand, and 
touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy 
departed from him. <A name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he charged him to tell no man: but 
go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, 
according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <A name=C5V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But so much the 
more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together 
to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. <A name=C5V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he withdrew 
himself in the deserts, and prayed. <A name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass on one of those 
days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law 
sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and 
Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal. <A name=C5V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, men 
bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to 
lay him before him. <A name=C5V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And not finding by what <I>way</I> they 
might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and 
let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus. <A 
name=C5V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And seeing their faith, he said, Man, 
thy sins are forgiven thee. <A name=C5V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribes and the Pharisees began 
to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, 
but God alone? <A name=C5V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, 
answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts? <A name=C5V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which is easier, to 
say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk? <A name=C5V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But that ye may 
know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto 
him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go 
unto thy house. <A name=C5V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And immediately he rose up before them, 
and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. <A 
name=C5V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And amazement took hold on all, and 
they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange 
things to-day. <A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these things he went forth, 
and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto 
him, Follow me. <A name=C5V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he forsook all, and rose up and 
followed him. <A name=C5V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Levi made him a great feast in his 
house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were 
sitting at meat with them. <A name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Pharisees and their scribes 
murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the 
publicans and sinners? <A name=C5V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answering said unto them, 
They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick. <A 
name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. <A name=C5V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto 
him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the 
<I>disciples</I> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink. <A name=C5V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto 
them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is 
with them? <A name=C5V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the days will come; and when the 
bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days. <A 
name=C5V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake also a parable unto them: 
No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; 
else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with 
the old. <A name=C5V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no man putteth new wine into old 
wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, 
and the skins will perish. <A name=C5V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But new wine must be put into fresh 
wine-skins. <A name=C5V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no man having drunk old <I>wine</I> 
desireth new; for he saith, The old is good. 
<P>
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that 
he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and 
did eat, rubbing them in their hands. <A name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But certain of the Pharisees said, Why 
do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day? <A name=C6V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answering 
them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, 
and they that were with him; <A name=C6V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how he entered into the house of God, 
and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which 
it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone? <A name=C6V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath. <A name=C6V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass 
on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was 
a man there, and his right hand was withered. <A name=C6V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribes and 
the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might 
find how to accuse him. <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he knew their thoughts; and he said 
to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. 
And he arose and stood forth. <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is 
it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to 
destroy it? <A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he looked round about on them all, 
and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did <I>so</I>: and his hand 
was restored. <A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they were filled with madness; and 
communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. <A name=C6V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass 
in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all 
night in prayer to God. <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was day, he called his 
disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles: <A 
name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and 
Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, <A 
name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Matthew and Thomas, and James 
<I>the son</I> of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, <A 
name=C6V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Judas <I>the son</I> of James, and 
Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor; <A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he came down with them, and stood 
on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of 
the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, 
who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; <A name=C6V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they that were 
troubled with unclean spirits were healed. <A name=C6V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the 
multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed 
<I>them</I> all. <A name=C6V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he lifted up his eyes on his 
disciples, and said, Blessed <I>are</I> ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of 
God. <A name=C6V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed <I>are</I> ye that hunger now: 
for ye shall be filled. Blessed <I>are</I> ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. 
<A name=C6V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed are ye, when men shall hate 
you, and when they shall separate you <I>from their company</I>, and reproach 
you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. <A 
name=C6V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Rejoice in that day, and leap <I>for 
joy</I>: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did 
their fathers unto the prophets. <A name=C6V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But woe unto you that are rich! for ye 
have received your consolation. <A name=C6V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for 
ye shall hunger. Woe <I>unto you</I>, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and 
weep. <A name=C6V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe <I>unto you</I>, when all men shall 
speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false 
prophets. <A name=C6V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say unto you that hear, Love your 
enemies, do good to them that hate you, <A name=C6V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>bless them that curse you, pray for 
them that despitefully use you. <A name=C6V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<I>one</I> cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak 
withhold not thy coat also. <A name=C6V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Give to every one that asketh thee; and 
of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. <A name=C6V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as ye would 
that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. <A name=C6V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if ye love them 
that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them. 
<A name=C6V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if ye do good to them that do good 
to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same. <A name=C6V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if ye lend to 
them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to 
sinners, to receive again as much. <A name=C6V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But love your enemies, and do 
<I>them</I> good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, 
and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and 
evil. <A name=C6V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Be ye merciful, even as your Father is 
merciful. <A name=C6V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And judge not, and ye shall not be 
judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be 
released: <A name=C6V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>give, and it shall be given unto you; 
good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into 
your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again. <A 
name=C6V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake also a parable unto them, 
Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit? <A 
name=C6V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The disciple is not above his teacher: 
but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher. <A name=C6V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And why beholdest 
thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is 
in thine own eye? <A name=C6V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or how canst thou say to thy brother, 
Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself 
beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first 
the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the 
mote that is in thy brother's eye. <A name=C6V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there is no good tree that bringeth 
forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit. <A 
name=C6V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For each tree is known by its own 
fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they 
grapes. <A name=C6V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The good man out of the good treasure 
of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil <I>man</I> out of 
the evil <I>treasure</I> bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the 
abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. <A name=C6V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And why call ye me, 
Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? <A name=C6V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every one that 
cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he 
is like: <A name=C6V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>he is like a man building a house, who 
digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood 
arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it 
had been well builded. <A name=C6V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he that heareth, and doeth not, is 
like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which 
the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was 
great. 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After he had ended all his sayings in 
the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum. <A name=C7V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain 
centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death. 
<A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he heard concerning Jesus, he 
sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his 
servant. <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, when they came to Jesus, 
besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for 
him; <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he loveth our nation, and himself 
built us our synagogue. <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus went with them. And when he 
was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto 
him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come 
under my roof: <A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>wherefore neither thought I myself 
worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed. <A 
name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to 
this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my 
servant, Do this, and he doeth it. <A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus heard these things, he 
marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I 
say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. <A 
name=C7V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that were sent, returning to 
the house, found the servant whole. <A name=C7V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass soon afterwards, 
that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great 
multitude. <A name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when he drew near to the gate of 
the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his 
mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. <A 
name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the Lord saw her, he had 
compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. <A name=C7V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came nigh 
and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say 
unto thee, Arise. <A name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he that was dead sat up, and began 
to speak. And he gave him to his mother. <A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And fear took hold on all: and they 
glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited 
his people. <A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And this report went forth concerning 
him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about. <A name=C7V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the disciples 
of John told him of all these things. <A name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And John calling unto him two of his 
disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for 
another? <A name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the men were come unto him, 
they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that 
cometh, or look we for another? <A name=C7V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In that hour he cured many of diseases 
and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. <A 
name=C7V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered and said unto them, Go 
and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their 
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are 
raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them. <A name=C7V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And blessed is he, 
whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. <A name=C7V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the 
messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning 
John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the 
wind? <A name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But what went ye out to see? a man 
clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live 
delicately, are in kings' courts. <A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But what went ye out to see? a prophet? 
Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. <A name=C7V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is he of whom 
it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, 
<P>&nbsp;Who shall prepare thy way before thee. 
<P><A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto you, Among them that are 
born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the 
kingdom of God is greater than he. <A name=C7V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the people when they heard, and 
the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. <A 
name=C7V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Pharisees and the lawyers 
rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him. <A 
name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whereunto then shall I liken the men of 
this generation, and to what are they like? <A name=C7V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They are like unto 
children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped 
unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep. <A 
name=C7V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For John the Baptist is come eating no 
bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon. <A name=C7V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Son of man is 
come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a 
winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! <A name=C7V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And wisdom is 
justified of all her children. <A name=C7V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of the Pharisees desired him 
that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat 
down to meat. <A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, a woman who was in the 
city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's 
house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment, <A name=C7V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and standing behind 
at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them 
with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the 
ointment. <A name=C7V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when the Pharisee that had bidden 
him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, 
would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, 
that she is a sinner. <A name=C7V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answering said unto him, 
Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on. <A 
name=C7V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A 
certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the 
other fifty. <A name=C7V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had not <I>wherewith</I> to 
pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most? <A 
name=C7V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, 
to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. <A 
name=C7V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And turning to the woman, he said unto 
Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water 
for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her 
hair. <A name=C7V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since 
the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. <A name=C7V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>My head with oil 
thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. <A 
name=C7V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, 
which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is 
forgiven, <I>the same</I> loveth little. <A name=C7V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto her, Thy sins are 
forgiven. <A name=C7V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that sat at meat with him 
began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? <A 
name=C7V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto the woman, Thy faith 
hath saved thee; go in peace. 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass soon afterwards, 
that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good 
tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve, <A name=C8V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and certain women 
who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called 
Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, <A name=C8V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Joanna the wife 
of Chuzas Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto 
them of their substance. <A name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when a great multitude came 
together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable: <A 
name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The 
sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; 
and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it. <A 
name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had 
no moisture. <A name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And other fell amidst the thorns; and 
the thorns grew with it, and choked it. <A name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And other fell into the good ground, and 
grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, 
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his disciples asked him what this 
parable might be. <A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Unto you it is given to 
know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that 
seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. <A 
name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the parable is this: The seed is 
the word of God. <A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And those by the way side are they that 
have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, 
that they may not believe and be saved. <A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And those on the rock <I>are</I> they 
who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, 
who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. <A 
name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And that which fell among the thorns, 
these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with 
cares and riches and pleasures of <I>this</I> life, and bring no fruit to 
perfection. <A name=C8V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And that in the good ground, these are 
such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and 
bring forth fruit with patience. <A name=C8V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no man, when he hath lighted a 
lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a 
stand, that they that enter in may see the light. <A name=C8V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For nothing is hid, 
that shall not be made manifest; nor <I>anything</I> secret, that shall not be 
known and come to light. <A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take heed therefore how ye hear: for 
whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be 
taken away even that which he thinketh he hath. <A name=C8V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came to 
him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd. <A 
name=C8V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was told him, Thy mother and thy 
brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. <A name=C8V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he answered and 
said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, 
and do it. <A name=C8V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it came to pass on one of those 
days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto 
them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. 
<A name=C8V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and 
there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling <I>with 
water</I>, and were in jeopardy. <A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came to him, and awoke him, 
saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the 
raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. <A name=C8V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to 
another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and 
they obey him? <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they arrived at the country of the 
Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee. <A name=C8V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was 
come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had 
demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in <I>any</I> 
house, but in the tombs. <A name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, 
and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with 
thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not. <A 
name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he was commanding the unclean 
spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was 
kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands 
asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts. <A name=C8V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus asked 
him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into 
him. <A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they entreated him that he would 
not command them to depart into the abyss. <A name=C8V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was there 
a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he 
would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave. <A 
name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the demons came out from the man, 
and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, 
and were drowned. <A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they that fed them saw what 
had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. <A 
name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went out to see what had come 
to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were 
gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they 
were afraid. <A name=C8V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that saw it told them how he 
that was possessed with demons was made whole. <A name=C8V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the people 
of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them, for 
they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned. <A 
name=C8V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the man from whom the demons were 
gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying, <A 
name=C8V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Return to thy house, and declare how 
great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout 
the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him. <A name=C8V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as Jesus 
returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him. <A 
name=C8V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, there came a man named 
Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, 
and besought him to come into his house; <A name=C8V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he had an only daughter, about 
twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged 
him. <A name=C8V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a woman having an issue of blood 
twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be 
healed of any, <A name=C8V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>came behind him, and touched the border 
of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched. <A 
name=C8V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said, Who is it that touched 
me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the 
multitudes press thee and crush <I>thee</I>. <A name=C8V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said, 
Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. <A 
name=C8V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the woman saw that she was not 
hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of 
all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed 
immediately. <A name=C8V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy 
faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. <A name=C8V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While he yet spake, there cometh one 
from the ruler of the synagogue's <I>house</I>, saying, Thy daughter is dead; 
trouble not the Teacher. <A name=C8V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus hearing it, answered him, 
Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole. <A name=C8V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he came to 
the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, 
and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother. <A name=C8V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all were 
weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but 
sleepeth. <A name=C8V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing 
that she was dead. <A name=C8V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he, taking her by the hand, called, 
saying, Maiden, arise. <A name=C8V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And her spirit returned, and she rose 
up immediately: and he commanded that <I>something</I> be given her to eat. <A 
name=C8V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And her parents were amazed: but he 
charged them to tell no man what had been done. 
<P>
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called the twelve together, and 
gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. <A 
name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <A 
name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor 
bread, nor money; neither have two coats. <A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And into whatsoever house ye enter, 
there abide, and thence depart. <A name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as many as receive you not, when ye 
depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against 
them. <A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they departed, and went throughout 
the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere. <A name=C9V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Herod the 
tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it 
was said by some, that John was risen from the dead; <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and by some, that 
Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen 
again. <A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who 
is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him. <A 
name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the apostles, when they were 
returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and 
withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. <A name=C9V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the multitudes 
perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the 
kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured. <A name=C9V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the day began 
to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, 
that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get 
provisions: for we are here in a desert place. <A name=C9V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said unto 
them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and 
two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people. <A 
name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they were about five thousand men. 
And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty 
each. <A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they did so, and made them all sit 
down. <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took the five loaves and the two 
fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the 
disciples to set before the multitude. <A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they ate, and were all filled: and 
there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve 
baskets. <A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as he was praying 
apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the 
multitudes say that I am? <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they answering said, John the 
Baptist; but others <I>say</I>, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets 
is risen again. <A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, But who say ye 
that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God. <A name=C9V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he charged 
them, and commanded <I>them</I> to tell this to no man; <A name=C9V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, The Son of 
man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and 
scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. <A name=C9V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross 
daily, and follow me. <A name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever would save his life shall 
lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. 
<A name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what is a man profited, if he gain 
the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self? <A name=C9V26><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever shall 
be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when 
he cometh in his own glory, and <I>the glory</I> of the Father, and of the holy 
angels. <A name=C9V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I tell you of a truth, There are 
some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see 
the kingdom of God. <A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass about eight days 
after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up 
into the mountain to pray. <A name=C9V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he was praying, the fashion of 
his countenance was altered, and his raiment <I>became</I> white <I>and</I> 
dazzling. <A name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, there talked with him two 
men, who were Moses and Elijah; <A name=C9V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who appeared in glory, and spake of his 
decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. <A name=C9V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Peter and they 
that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they 
saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. <A name=C9V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good 
for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for 
Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said. <A name=C9V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while he said 
these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they 
entered into the cloud. <A name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a voice came out of the cloud, 
saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him. <A name=C9V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the voice 
came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those 
days any of the things which they had seen. <A name=C9V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great 
multitude met him. <A name=C9V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, a man from the multitude 
cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only 
child: <A name=C9V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he 
suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth 
from him, bruising him sorely. <A name=C9V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I besought thy disciples to cast it 
out; and they could not. <A name=C9V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answered and said, O 
faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with 
you? bring hither thy son. <A name=C9V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he was yet a coming, the demon 
dashed him down, and tare <I>him</I> grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean 
spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. <A name=C9V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were all 
astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the 
things which he did, he said unto his disciples, <A name=C9V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let these words 
sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of 
men. <A name=C9V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they understood not this saying, 
and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were 
afraid to ask him about this saying. <A name=C9V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there arose a reasoning among them, 
which of them was the greatest. <A name=C9V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Jesus saw the reasoning of 
their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side, <A 
name=C9V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said unto them, Whosoever shall 
receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive 
me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is 
great. <A name=C9V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And John answered and said, Master, we 
saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth 
not with us. <A name=C9V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said unto him, Forbid 
<I>him</I> not: for he that is not against you is for you. <A name=C9V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he 
stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, <A name=C9V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and sent messengers 
before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to 
make ready for him. <A name=C9V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they did not receive him, because 
his face was <I>as though he were</I> going to Jerusalem. <A name=C9V54><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when his 
disciples James and John saw <I>this</I>, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid 
fire to come down from heaven, and consume them? <A name=C9V55><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he turned, and 
rebuked them. <A name=C9V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went to another village. <A 
name=C9V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they went on the way, a certain 
man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. <A 
name=C9V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have 
holes, and the birds of the heaven <I>have</I> nests; but the Son of man hath 
not where to lay his head. <A name=C9V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto another, Follow me. 
But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. <A name=C9V60><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said unto 
him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the 
kingdom of God. <A name=C9V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And another also said, I will follow 
thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house. <A 
name=C9V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said unto him, No man, having 
put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. 
<P>
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after these things the Lord 
appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every 
city and place, whither he himself was about to come. <A name=C10V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye 
therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest. 
<A name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Go your ways; behold, I send you forth 
as lambs in the midst of wolves. <A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; 
and salute no man on the way. <A name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And into whatsoever house ye shall 
enter, first say, Peace <I>be</I> to this house. <A name=C10V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if a son of 
peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you 
again. <A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in that same house remain, eating 
and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go 
not from house to house. <A name=C10V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And into whatsoever city ye enter, and 
they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: <A name=C10V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and heal the sick 
that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
<A name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But into whatsoever city ye shall 
enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, <A 
name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even the dust from your city, that 
cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the 
kingdom of God is come nigh. <A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto you, it shall be more 
tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. <A name=C10V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto thee, 
Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in 
Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, 
sitting in sackcloth and ashes. <A name=C10V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But it shall be more tolerable for 
Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you. <A name=C10V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And thou, 
Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto 
Hades. <A name=C10V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that heareth you heareth me; and he 
that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that 
sent me. <A name=C10V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the seventy returned with joy, 
saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name. <A 
name=C10V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan 
fallen as lightning from heaven. <A name=C10V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, I have given you authority to 
tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and 
nothing shall in any wise hurt you. <A name=C10V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that 
the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in 
heaven. <A name=C10V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In that same hour he rejoiced in the 
Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that 
thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal 
them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. <A

of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the 
Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal 
<I>him</I>. <A name=C10V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And turning to the disciples, he said 
privately, Blessed <I>are</I> the eyes which see the things that ye see: <A 
name=C10V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I say unto you, that many prophets 
and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear 
the things which ye hear, and heard them not. <A name=C10V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, a 
certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do 
to inherit eternal life? <A name=C10V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, What is written 
in the law? how readest thou? <A name=C10V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answering said, Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. <A 
name=C10V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, Thou hast 
answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. <A name=C10V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he, desiring 
to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? <A 
name=C10V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus made answer and said, A certain 
man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who 
both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. <A 
name=C10V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And by chance a certain priest was 
going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. <A 
name=C10V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in like manner a Levite also, when 
he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. <A 
name=C10V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a certain Samaritan, as he 
journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, 
<A name=C10V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and came to him, and bound up his 
wounds, pouring on <I>them</I> oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, 
and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. <A name=C10V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on the morrow 
he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of 
him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay 
thee. <A name=C10V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which of these three, thinkest thou, 
proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? <A name=C10V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, He 
that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. <A 
name=C10V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now as they went on their way, he 
entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him 
into her house. <A name=C10V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word. <A name=C10V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Martha was 
cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou 
not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she 
help me. <A name=C10V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Lord answered and said unto 
her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: <A 
name=C10V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but one thing is needful: for Mary 
hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her. 
<P>
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as he was praying 
in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, 
Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. <A 
name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, When ye pray, 
say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. <A name=C11V3><FONT

our daily bread. <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into 
temptation. <A name=C11V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Which of you 
shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, 
lend me three loaves; <A name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for a friend of mine is come to me from 
a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; <A name=C11V7><FONT

shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are 
with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee? <A name=C11V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto you, 
Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of 
his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth. <A

size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall 
be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
<A name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For every one that asketh receiveth; 
and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. <A

size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And of which of you that is a father 
shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish 
give him a serpent? <A name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or <I>if</I> he shall ask an egg, will 
he give him a scorpion? <A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall <I>your</I> heavenly 
Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? <A name=C11V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was casting 
out a demon <I>that was</I> dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone 
out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled. <A name=C11V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But some of them 
said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons. <A 
name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And others, trying <I>him</I>, sought 
of him a sign from heaven. <A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he, knowing their thoughts, said 
unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a 
house <I>divided</I> against a house falleth. <A name=C11V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if Satan also 
is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I 
cast out demons by Beelzebub. <A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, 
by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. <A

size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if I by the finger of God cast out 
demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. <A name=C11V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the strong 
<I>man</I> fully armed guardeth his own court, his goods are in peace: <A 
name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but when a stronger than he shall come 
upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he 
trusted, and divideth his spoils. <A name=C11V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that is not with me is against me; 
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. <A name=C11V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The unclean spirit 
when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, 
and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out. <A

swept and garnished. <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then goeth he, and taketh <I>to 
him</I> seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell 
there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. <A 
name=C11V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as he said these 
things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto 
him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck. 
<A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said, Yea rather, blessed are 
they that hear the word of God, and keep it. <A name=C11V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the 
multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is 
an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to 
it but the sign of Jonah. <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For even as Jonah became a sign unto 
the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. <A 
name=C11V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The queen of the south shall rise up 
in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she 
came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a 
greater than Solomon is here. <A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The men of Nineveh shall stand up in 
the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at

putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they 
which enter in may see the light. <A name=C11V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The lamp of thy body is thine eye: 
when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is 
evil, thy body also is full of darkness. <A name=C11V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Look therefore 
whether the light that is in thee be not darkness. <A name=C11V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore thy 
whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of 
light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light. <A

to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. <A name=C11V38><FONT

Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before 
dinner. <A name=C11V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the 
Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward 
part is full of extortion and wickedness. <A name=C11V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye foolish ones, 
did not he that made the outside make the inside also? <A name=C11V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But give for alms 
those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you. <A 
name=C11V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye 
tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: 
but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. <A 
name=C11V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love 
the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces. <A 
name=C11V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs 
which appear not, and the men that walk over <I>them</I> know it not. <A 
name=C11V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of the lawyers answering saith 
unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also. <A name=C11V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Woe 
unto you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye 
yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. <A name=C11V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto you! for 
ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. <A 
name=C11V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So ye are witnesses and consent unto 
the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build <I>their 
tombs</I>. <A name=C11V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore also said the wisdom of God, 
I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and <I>some</I> of them they shall 
kill and persecute; <A name=C11V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that the blood of all the prophets, 
which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this 
generation; <A name=C11V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>from the blood of Abel unto the blood 
of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto 
you, it shall be required of this generation. <A name=C11V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto you 
lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, 
and them that were entering in ye hindered. <A name=C11V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was 
come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon 
<I>him</I> vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things; <A 
name=C11V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

something out of his mouth.

thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one

leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. <A name=C12V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there is 
nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be

the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in 
the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. <A name=C12V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I say unto you 
my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no 
more that they can do. <A name=C12V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: 
Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto 
you, Fear him. <A name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

pence? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God. <A name=C12V7><FONT

of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many 
sparrows. <A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I say unto you, Every one who shall 
confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels 
of God: <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he that denieth me in the presence 
of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God. <A

size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And every one who shall speak a word 
against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth 
against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they 
bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not 
anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: <A name=C12V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for the Holy 
Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say. <A

him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. <A

a judge or a divider over you? <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the 
abundance of the things which he possesseth. <A name=C12V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake a 
parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth 
plentifully: <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he reasoned within himself, 
saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits? <A

pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and 
my goods. <A name=C12V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. 
<A name=C12V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast 
prepared, whose shall they be? <A name=C12V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

himself, and is not rich toward God. <A name=C12V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for <I>your</I> life, what ye shall 
eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. <A name=C12V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the life is 
more than the food, and the body than the raiment. <A name=C12V24><FONT

ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn;

they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his 
glory was not arrayed like one of these. <A name=C12V28><FONT

clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the

what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. <A name=C12V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For all these 
things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye 
have need of these things. <A name=C12V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in 
the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth 
destroyeth. <A name=C12V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

your heart be also. <A name=C12V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

your lamps burning; <A name=C12V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and be ye yourselves like unto men 
looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when 
he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him. <A name=C12V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed are those 
servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto 
you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come 
and serve them. <A name=C12V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

watch, and if in the third, and find <I>them</I> so blessed are those 
<I>servants</I>. <A name=C12V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But know this, that if the master of 
the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, 
and not have left his house to be broken through. <A name=C12V40><FONT

for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh. <A name=C12V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter said, 
Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all? <A name=C12V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord said, 
Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his 
household, to give them their portion of food in due season? <A

size=-1><SUP>12:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord 
when he cometh shall find so doing. <A name=C12V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

will set him over all that he hath. <A name=C12V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if that servant shall say in his 
heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and 
the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; <A name=C12V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the lord of that 
servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he 
knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the 
unfaithful. <A name=C12V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And that servant, who knew his lord's 
will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with 
many <I>stripes</I>; <A name=C12V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he that knew not, and did things 
worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few <I>stripes</I>. And to whomsoever 
much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of 
him will they ask the more. <A name=C12V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and what do I desire, if it is already kindled? <A name=C12V50><FONT

in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: <A name=C12V52><FONT

from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against 
three. <A name=C12V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

how to interpret this time? <A name=C12V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

not what is right? <A name=C12V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the 
officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison. <A name=C12V59><FONT

Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the very last mite.

their sacrifices. <A name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because 
they have suffered these things? <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

ye shall all in like manner perish. <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and found none. <A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto the vinedresser, 
Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: 
cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground? <A name=C13V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answering 
saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it,

<I>well</I>; but if not, thou shalt cut it down. <A name=C13V10><FONT

teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day. <A name=C13V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, a 
woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, 
and could in no wise lift herself up. <A name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus saw her, he called her, 
and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. <A 
name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he laid his hands upon her: and 
immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. <A name=C13V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the ruler of 
the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the 
sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men 
ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the 
sabbath. <A name=C13V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the Lord answered him, and said, 
Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass 
from the stall, and lead him away to watering? <A name=C13V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ought not this 
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, <I>these</I> 
eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath? <A

glorious things that were done by him. <A name=C13V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it? <A name=C13V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is like unto a 
grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it

thereof. <A name=C13V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

liken the kingdom of God? <A name=C13V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for 
Herod would fain kill thee. <A name=C13V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the third <I>day</I> I am perfected. <A name=C13V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have 
gathered thy children together, even as a hen <I>gathereth</I> her own brood 
under her wings, and ye would not! <A name=C13V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that 
they were watching him. <A name=C14V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

certain man that had the dropsy. <A name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they held their peace. And he took 
him, and healed him, and let him go. <A name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him 
up on a sabbath day? <A name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

these things. <A name=C14V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto 
them, <A name=C14V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man 
than thou be bidden of him, <A name=C14V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame 
to take the lowest place. <A name=C14V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say 
to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all 
that sit at meat with thee. <A name=C14V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy 
brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee 
again, and a recompense be made thee. <A name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they have not <I>wherewith</I> to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed 
in the resurrection of the just. <A name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat 
bread in the kingdom of God. <A name=C14V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

made a great supper; and he bade many: <A name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for <I>all</I> things are now 
ready. <A name=C14V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must

lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, 
Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the 
poor and maimed and blind and lame. <A name=C14V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

didst command is done, and yet there is room. <A name=C14V23><FONT

unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain <I>them</I> 
to come in, that my house may be filled. <A name=C14V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I say unto 
you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper. <A

unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and

he have <I>wherewith</I> to complete it? <A name=C14V29><FONT

he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to 
mock him, <A name=C14V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And both the Pharisees and the scribes 
murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. <A 
name=C15V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake unto them this parable, 
saying, <A name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What man of you, having a hundred 
sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the 
wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? <A 
name=C15V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he hath found it, he layeth it 
on his shoulders, rejoicing. <A name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he cometh home, he calleth 
together his friends and his neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I 
have found my sheep which was lost. <A name=C15V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto you, that even so there 
shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, <I>more</I> than over 
ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance. <A name=C15V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or what woman 
having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and 
sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it? <A name=C15V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when she hath 
found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with 
me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. <A name=C15V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even so, I say 
unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that 
repenteth. <A name=C15V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, A certain man had two 
sons: <A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the younger of them said to his 
father, Father, give me the portion of <I>thy</I> substance that falleth to me. 
And he divided unto them his living. <A name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And not many days after, the younger 
son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he 
wasted his substance with riotous living. <A name=C15V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had 
spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in 
want. <A name=C15V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went and joined himself to one 
of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. 
<A name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he would fain have filled his 
belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. <A 
name=C15V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he came to himself he said, 
How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I 
perish here with hunger! <A name=C15V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will arise and go to my father, and 
will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: <A 
name=C15V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am no more worthy to be called your 
son: make me as one of thy hired servants. <A name=C15V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he arose, and 
came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was 
moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <A 
name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the son said unto him, Father, I 
have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called 
thy son. <A name=C15V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the father said to his servants, 
Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his 
hand, and shoes on his feet: <A name=C15V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and bring the fatted calf, <I>and</I> 
kill it, and let us eat, and make merry: <A name=C15V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for this my son 
was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be 
merry. <A name=C15V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now his elder son was in the field: 
and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. <A 
name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called to him one of the 
servants, and inquired what these things might be. <A name=C15V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he 
hath received him safe and sound. <A name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he was angry, and would not go in: 
and his father came out, and entreated him. <A name=C15V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he answered 
and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never 
transgressed a commandment of thine; and <I>yet</I> thou never gavest me a kid, 
that I might make merry with my friends: <A name=C15V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but when this thy 
son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the 
fatted calf. <A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, Son, thou art 
ever with me, and all that is mine is thine. <A name=C15V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But it was meet to 
make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive 
<I>again</I>; and <I>was</I> lost, and is found. 
<P>
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said also unto the disciples, 
There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto 
him that he was wasting his goods. <A name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called him, and said unto him, 
What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for 
thou canst be no longer steward. <A name=C16V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the steward said within himself, 
What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have 
not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. <A name=C16V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I am resolved what 
to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into 
their houses. <A name=C16V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And calling to him each one of his 
lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? <A 
name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. 
And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. <A 
name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then said he to another, And how much 
owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take 
thy bond, and write fourscore. <A name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his lord commended the unrighteous 
steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own 
generation wiser than the sons of the light. <A name=C16V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I say unto you, 
Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when 
it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. <A 
name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that is faithful in a very little 
is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is 
unrighteous also in much. <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore ye have not been faithful 
in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <I>riches</I>? 
<A name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if ye have not been faithful in 
that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? <A 
name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No servant can serve two masters: for 
either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, 
and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <A name=C16V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Pharisees, 
who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. <A 
name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Ye are they 
that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for 
that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. <A 
name=C16V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The law and the prophets <I>were</I> 
until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and 
every man entereth violently into it. <A name=C16V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But it is easier for heaven and earth 
to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall. <A name=C16V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every one that 
putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that 
marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery. <A 
name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was a certain rich man, and 
he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: <A 
name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and a certain beggar named Lazarus was 
laid at his gate, full of sores, <A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and desiring to be fed with the 
<I>crumbs</I> that fell from the rich man's table; yea, even the dogs come and 
licked his sores. <A name=C16V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that the beggar 
died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the 
rich man also died, and was buried. <A name=C16V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, 
being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. <A 
name=C16V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, 
have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in 
water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. <A 
name=C16V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Abraham said, Son, remember that 
thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil 
things: but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish. <A 
name=C16V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And besides all this, between us and 
you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may 
not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us. <A 
name=C16V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, I pray thee therefore, 
father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house; <A name=C16V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I have five 
brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of 
torment. <A name=C16V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Abraham saith, They have Moses and 
the prophets; let them hear them. <A name=C16V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but 
if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. <A name=C16V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if 
one rise from the dead. 
<P>
<P><A name=C17V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto his disciples, It is 
impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, 
through whom they come! <A name=C17V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It were well for him if a millstone 
were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he 
should cause one of these little ones to stumble. <A name=C17V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Take heed to 
yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. <A 
name=C17V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if he sin against thee seven times 
in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt 
forgive him. <A name=C17V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the apostles said unto the Lord, 
Increase our faith. <A name=C17V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a 
grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, 
and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you. <A name=C17V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But who is there of 
you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he 
is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat; <A 
name=C17V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and will not rather say unto him, Make 
ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and 
drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? <A name=C17V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Doth he thank the 
servant because he did the things that were commanded? <A name=C17V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even so ye also, 
when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are 
unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do. <A 
name=C17V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as they were on 
their way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and 
Galilee. <A name=C17V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he entered into a certain 
village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off: <A 
name=C17V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they lifted up their voices, 
saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. <A name=C17V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he saw 
them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to 
pass, as they went, they were cleansed. <A name=C17V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of them, when he saw that he 
was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God; <A name=C17V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he fell upon 
his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. <A 
name=C17V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answering said, Were not the 
ten cleansed? but where are the nine? <A name=C17V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Were there none found that returned to 
give glory to God, save this stranger? <A name=C17V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, Arise, and go 
thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. <A name=C17V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And being asked by 
the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The 
kingdom of God cometh not with observation: <A name=C17V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>neither shall they 
say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you. <A 
name=C17V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto the disciples, The 
days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, 
and ye shall not see it. <A name=C17V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they shall say to you, Lo, there! 
Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after <I>them</I>: <A name=C17V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>17:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for as the 
lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto 
the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day. <A 
name=C17V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and be rejected of this generation. <A name=C17V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as it came to pass in the days of 
Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. <A 
name=C17V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They ate, they drank, they married, 
they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and 
the flood came, and destroyed them all. <A name=C17V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Likewise even as it came to pass in 
the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, 
they builded; <A name=C17V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>17:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but in the day that Lot went out from 
Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: <A

the day that the Son of man is revealed. <A name=C17V31><FONT

that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down 
to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back. <A 
name=C17V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C18V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

size=-1><SUP>18:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord said, Hear what the 
unrighteous judge saith. <A name=C18V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And shall not God avenge his elect, 
that cry to him day and night, and <I>yet</I> he is longsuffering over them? <A 
name=C18V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of 
man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? <A name=C18V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake also 
this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, 
and set all others at nought: <A name=C18V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Two men went up into the temple to 
pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. <A name=C18V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisee stood 
and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of 
men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <A 
name=C18V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I fast twice in the week; I give 
tithes of all that I get. <A name=C18V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the publican, standing afar off, 
would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, 
God, be thou merciful to me a sinner. <A name=C18V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto you, This man went down to 
his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself 
shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. <A 
name=C18V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were bringing unto him also 
their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they 
rebuked them. <A name=C18V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus called them unto him, 
saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to 
such belongeth the kingdom of God. <A name=C18V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall 
not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter 
therein. <A name=C18V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, 
Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? <A name=C18V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said 
unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, <I>even</I> God. <A 
name=C18V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not 
commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy 
father and mother. <A name=C18V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, All these things have I 
observed from my youth up. <A name=C18V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus heard it, he said unto 
him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto 
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. <A 
name=C18V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he heard these things, he 
became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich. <A name=C18V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus seeing 
him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
<A name=C18V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is easier for a camel to enter 
in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
<A name=C18V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that heard it said, Then who 
can be saved? <A name=C18V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he said, The things which are 
impossible with men are possible with God. <A name=C18V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter said, 
Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee. <A name=C18V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or 
brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, <A 
name=C18V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who shall not receive manifold more in 
this time, and in the world to come eternal life. <A name=C18V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took unto 
him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the 
things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son 
of man. <A name=C18V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he shall be delivered up unto the 
Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon: <A 
name=C18V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they shall scourge and kill him: 
and the third day he shall rise again. <A name=C18V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they understood none of these 
things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things 
that were said. <A name=C18V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, as he drew nigh 
unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: <A 
name=C18V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and hearing a multitude going by, he 
inquired what this meant. <A name=C18V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they told him that Jesus of 
Nazareth passeth by. <A name=C18V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son 
of David, have mercy on me. <A name=C18V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that went before rebuked him, 
that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son 
of David, have mercy on me. <A name=C18V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to 
be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, <A 
name=C18V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What wilt thou that I should do unto 
thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. <A name=C18V42><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>18:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said 
unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath made thee whole. <A 
name=C18V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>18:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And immediately he received his sight, 
and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave 
praise unto God. 
<P>
<P><A name=C19V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he entered and was passing through 
Jericho. <A name=C19V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, a man called by name 
Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. <A name=C19V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sought to 
see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of 
stature. <A name=C19V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he ran on before, and climbed up 
into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. <A 
name=C19V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus came to the place, he 
looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I 
must abide at thy house. <A name=C19V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he made haste, and came down, and 
received him joyfully. <A name=C19V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they saw it, they all 
murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner. <A 
name=C19V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the 
Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have 
wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold. <A name=C19V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto 
him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of 
Abraham. <A name=C19V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Son of man came to seek and to 
save that which was lost. <A name=C19V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they heard these things, he 
added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and <I>because</I> 
they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear. <A 
name=C19V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said therefore, A certain nobleman 
went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. <A 
name=C19V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called ten servants of his, and 
gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye <I>herewith</I> till I come. 
<A name=C19V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But his citizens hated him, and sent 
an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us. <A 
name=C19V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, when he was come 
back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto 
whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they 
had gained by trading. <A name=C19V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the first came before him, saying, 
Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more. <A name=C19V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very 
little, have thou authority over ten cities. <A name=C19V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the second 
came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds. <A name=C19V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
him also, Be thou also over five cities. <A name=C19V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And another came, 
saying, Lord, behold, <I>here is</I> thy pound, which I kept laid up in a 
napkin: <A name=C19V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I feared thee, because thou art an 
austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that 
which thou didst not sow. <A name=C19V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He saith unto him, Out of thine own 
mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere 
man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow; 
<A name=C19V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>then wherefore gavest thou not my 
money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest? 
<A name=C19V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them that stood by, 
Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds. <A 
name=C19V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto him, Lord, he hath 
ten pounds. <A name=C19V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto you, that unto every one 
that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath 
shall be taken away from him. <A name=C19V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But these mine enemies, that would not 
that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. <A 
name=C19V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had thus spoken, he went 
on before, going up to Jerusalem. <A name=C19V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, when he drew nigh 
unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of 
the disciples, <A name=C19V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Go your way into the village 
over against <I>you</I>; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon 
no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him. <A name=C19V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if any one ask 
you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him. <A 
name=C19V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that were sent went away, and 
found even as he had said unto them. <A name=C19V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they were loosing the colt, the 
owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? <A name=C19V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said, The 
Lord hath need of him. <A name=C19V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they brought him to Jesus: and 
they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon. <A 
name=C19V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he went, they spread their 
garments in the way. <A name=C19V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he was now drawing nigh, 
<I>even</I> at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the 
disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty 
works which they had seen; <A name=C19V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Blessed <I>is</I> the King 
that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. 
<A name=C19V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some of the Pharisees from the 
multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples. <A name=C19V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>19:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered 
and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry 
out. <A name=C19V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he drew nigh, he saw the city 
and wept over it, <A name=C19V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, If thou hadst known in this 
day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from 
thine eyes. <A name=C19V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the days shall come upon thee, 
when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and 
keep thee in on every side, <A name=C19V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and shall dash thee to the ground, and 
thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon 
another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. <A 
name=C19V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he entered into the temple, and 
began to cast out them that sold, <A name=C19V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying unto them, It is written, And 
my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers. <A 
name=C19V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was teaching daily in the 
temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the 
people sought to destroy him: <A name=C19V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>19:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they could not find what they 
might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening. 
<P>
<P><A name=C20V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, on one of the 
days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, 
there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders; <A 
name=C20V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they spake, saying unto him, Tell 
us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this 
authority? <A name=C20V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answered and said unto them, I 
also will ask you a question; and tell me: <A name=C20V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The baptism of 
John, was it from heaven, or from men? <A name=C20V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they reasoned with themselves, 
saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him? 
<A name=C20V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if we shall say, From men; all the 
people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. <A 
name=C20V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they answered, that they knew not 
whence <I>it was</I>. <A name=C20V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell 
I you by what authority I do these things. <A name=C20V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he began to 
speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to 
husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time. <A name=C20V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And at the season 
he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of 
the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. <A 
name=C20V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sent yet another servant: and 
him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty. <A 
name=C20V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sent yet a third: and him also 
they wounded, and cast him forth. <A name=C20V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the lord of the vineyard said, 
What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him. 
<A name=C20V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the husbandmen saw him, they 
reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the 
inheritance may be ours. <A name=C20V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they cast him forth out of the 
vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto 
them? <A name=C20V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He will come and destroy these 
husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they 
said, God forbid. <A name=C20V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he looked upon them, and said, 
What then is this that is written, 
<P>&nbsp;The stone which the builders rejected, 
<P>&nbsp;The same was made the head of the corner? 
<P><A name=C20V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Every one that falleth on that stone 
shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him 
as dust. <A name=C20V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribes and the chief priests 
sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for 
they perceived that he spake this parable against them. <A name=C20V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they watched 
him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they 
might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the 
authority of the governor. <A name=C20V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they asked him, saying, Teacher, 
we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person 
<I>of any</I>, but of a truth teachest the way of God: <A name=C20V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Is it lawful for 
us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? <A name=C20V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he perceived their craftiness, and 
said unto them, <A name=C20V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Show me a denarius. Whose image and 
superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar's. <A name=C20V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the 
things that are God's. <A name=C20V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were not able to take hold of 
the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their 
peace. <A name=C20V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there came to him certain of the 
Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection; <A name=C20V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they asked 
him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man's brother die, having a 
wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed 
unto his brother. <A name=C20V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There were therefore seven brethren: 
and the first took a wife, and died childless; <A name=C20V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the second: <A 
name=C20V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the third took her; and likewise 
the seven also left no children, and died. <A name=C20V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Afterward the 
woman also died. <A name=C20V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the resurrection therefore whose 
wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife. <A name=C20V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said 
unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage: <A 
name=C20V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but they that are accounted worthy to 
attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are 
given in marriage: <A name=C20V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for neither can they die any more: for 
they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the 
resurrection. <A name=C20V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But that the dead are raised, even 
Moses showed, in <I>the place concerning</I> the Bush, when he calleth the Lord 
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. <A 
name=C20V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he is not the God of the dead, but 
of the living: for all live unto him. <A name=C20V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And certain of the scribes answering 
said, Teacher, thou hast well said. <A name=C20V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For they durst not any more ask him 
any question. <A name=C20V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, How say they 
that the Christ is David's son? <A name=C20V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For David himself saith in the book of 
Psalms, 
<P>&nbsp;The Lord said unto my Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;Sit thou on my right hand, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C20V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Till I make thine enemies the 
footstool of thy feet. 
<P><A name=C20V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>David therefore calleth him Lord, and 
how is he his son? <A name=C20V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in the hearing of all the people 
he said unto his disciples, <A name=C20V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>20:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Beware of the scribes, who desire to 
walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in 
the synagogues, and chief places at feasts; <A name=C20V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>20:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who devour widows' 
houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater 
condemnation. 
<P>
<P><A name=C21V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he looked up, and saw the rich men 
that were casting their gifts into the treasury. <A name=C21V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saw a 
certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. <A name=C21V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Of a 
truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all: <A 
name=C21V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for all these did of their superfluity 
cast in unto the gifts; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she 
had. <A name=C21V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as some spake of the temple, how it 
was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said, <A name=C21V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As for these things 
which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one 
stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. <A name=C21V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they asked him, 
saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these things be? and what <I>shall be</I> 
the sign when these things are about to come to pass? <A name=C21V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Take 
heed that ye be not led astray: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am 
<I>he</I>; and, The time is at hand: go ye not after them. <A name=C21V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when ye shall 
hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to 
pass first; but the end is not immediately. <A name=C21V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then said he unto 
them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; <A 
name=C21V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and there shall be great earthquakes, 
and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and 
great signs from heaven. <A name=C21V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But before all these things, they 
shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the 
synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name's 
sake. <A name=C21V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It shall turn out unto you for a 
testimony. <A name=C21V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Settle it therefore in your hearts, 
not to meditate beforehand how to answer: <A name=C21V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I will give 
you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to 
withstand or to gainsay. <A name=C21V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But ye shall be delivered up even by 
parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and <I>some</I> of you shall 
they cause to be put to death. <A name=C21V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ye shall be hated of all men for 
my name's sake. <A name=C21V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And not a hair of your head shall 
perish. <A name=C21V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In your patience ye shall win your 
souls. <A name=C21V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when ye see Jerusalem compassed 
with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. <A name=C21V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then let them that 
are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her 
depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein. <A 
name=C21V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For these are days of vengeance, that 
all things which are written may be fulfilled. <A name=C21V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Woe unto them that 
are with child and to them that give suck in those days! for there shall be 
great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people. <A name=C21V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they shall 
fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: 
and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the 
Gentiles be fulfilled. <A name=C21V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there shall be signs in sun and 
moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the 
roaring of the sea and the billows; <A name=C21V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>men fainting for fear, and for 
expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the 
heavens shall be shaken. <A name=C21V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And then shall they see the Son of man 
coming in a cloud with power and great glory. <A name=C21V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when these 
things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your 
redemption draweth nigh. <A name=C21V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake to them a parable: Behold 
the fig tree, and all the trees: <A name=C21V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>when they now shoot forth, ye see it 
and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh. <A name=C21V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even so ye also, 
when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is 
nigh. <A name=C21V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto you, This generation 
shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished. <A name=C21V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Heaven and earth 
shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. <A name=C21V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But take heed to 
yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and 
drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a 
snare: <A name=C21V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for <I>so</I> shall it come upon all 
them that dwell on the face of all the earth. <A name=C21V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>21:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But watch ye at 
every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these 
things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. <A 
name=C21V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And every day he was teaching in the 
temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called 
Olivet. <A name=C21V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>21:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the people came early in the 
morning to him in the temple, to hear him. 
<P>
<P><A name=C22V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the feast of unleavened bread drew 
nigh, which is called the Passover. <A name=C22V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief priests and the scribes 
sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people. <A 
name=C22V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Satan entered into Judas who was 
called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. <A name=C22V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went away, 
and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto 
them. <A name=C22V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were glad, and covenanted to 
give him money. <A name=C22V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he consented, and sought 
opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude. <A 
name=C22V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the day of unleavened bread came, 
on which the passover must be sacrificed. <A name=C22V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sent Peter 
and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat. <A 
name=C22V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said unto him, Where wilt thou 
that we make ready? <A name=C22V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Behold, when ye 
are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of 
water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth. <A name=C22V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ye shall say 
unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the 
guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? <A 
name=C22V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he will show you a large upper 
room furnished: there make ready. <A name=C22V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went, and found as he had 
said unto them: and they made ready the passover. <A name=C22V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the hour 
was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him. <A name=C22V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: 
<A name=C22V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I say unto you, I shall not eat 
it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. <A name=C22V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he received a 
cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among 
yourselves: <A name=C22V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I say unto you, I shall not drink 
from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. 
<A name=C22V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took bread, and when he had 
given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is 
given for you: this do in remembrance of me. <A name=C22V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the cup in 
like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, 
<I>even</I> that which is poured out for you. <A name=C22V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But behold, the 
hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. <A name=C22V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Son of man 
indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he 
is betrayed! <A name=C22V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they began to question among 
themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. <A name=C22V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there arose 
also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest. <A 
name=C22V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, The kings of 
the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are 
called Benefactors. <A name=C22V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But ye <I>shall</I> not <I>be</I> so: 
but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that 
is chief, as he that doth serve. <A name=C22V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For which is greater, he that sitteth 
at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the 
midst of you as he that serveth. <A name=C22V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But ye are they that have continued 
with me in my temptations; <A name=C22V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even 
as my Father appointed unto me, <A name=C22V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that ye may eat and drink at my table 
in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
<A name=C22V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to 
have you, that he might sift you as wheat: <A name=C22V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but I made 
supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast 
turned again, establish thy brethren. <A name=C22V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, Lord, with thee 
I am ready to go both to prison and to death. <A name=C22V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, I 
tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny 
that thou knowest me. <A name=C22V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, When I sent you 
forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, 
Nothing. <A name=C22V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, But now, he 
that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath 
none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. <A name=C22V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I say unto 
you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned 
with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment. <A 
name=C22V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said, Lord, behold, here are 
two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. <A name=C22V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came out, 
and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also 
followed him. <A name=C22V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was at the place, he said 
unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. <A name=C22V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was parted 
from them about a stone's cast; and he kneeled down and prayed, <A 
name=C22V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, Father, if thou be willing, 
remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. <A 
name=C22V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there appeared unto him an angel 
from heaven, strengthening him. <A name=C22V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And being in an agony he prayed more 
earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down 
upon the ground. <A name=C22V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he rose up from his prayer, 
he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, <A 
name=C22V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise 
and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. <A name=C22V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While he yet 
spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, 
went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. <A name=C22V48><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said 
unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? <A name=C22V49><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they that 
were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the 
sword? <A name=C22V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain one of them smote the 
servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear. <A name=C22V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus answered 
and said, Suffer ye <I>them</I> thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed 
him. <A name=C22V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto the chief priests, 
and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come 
out, as against a robber, with swords and staves? <A name=C22V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I was daily 
with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this 
is your hour, and the power of darkness. <A name=C22V54><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they seized 
him, and led him <I>away</I>, and brought him into the high priest's house. But 
Peter followed afar off. <A name=C22V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had kindled a fire in 
the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of 
them. <A name=C22V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain maid seeing him as he 
sat in the light <I>of the fire</I>, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This 
man also was with him. <A name=C22V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he denied, saying, Woman, I know 
him not. <A name=C22V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after a little while another saw 
him, and said, Thou also art <I>one</I> of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. 
<A name=C22V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after the space of about one hour 
another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for 
he is a Galilaean. <A name=C22V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said, Man, I know not what 
thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. <A 
name=C22V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Lord turned, and looked upon 
Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, 
Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice. <A name=C22V62><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went out, 
and wept bitterly. <A name=C22V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the men that held <I>Jesus</I> 
mocked him, and beat him. <A name=C22V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they blindfolded him, and asked 
him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee? <A name=C22V65><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And many other 
things spake they against him, reviling him. <A name=C22V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as soon as it 
was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both 
chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying, <A 
name=C22V67><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If thou art the Christ, tell us. But 
he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: <A name=C22V68><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:68</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and if I ask 
<I>you</I>, ye will not answer. <A name=C22V69><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:69</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But from henceforth shall the Son of 
man be seated at the right hand of the power of God. <A name=C22V70><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>22:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they all said, 
Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. <A 
name=C22V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>22:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said, What further need have 
we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth. 
<P>
<P><A name=C23V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the whole company of them rose up, 
and brought him before Pilate. <A name=C23V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they began to accuse him, saying, 
We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to 
Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. <A name=C23V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate asked 
him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou 
sayest. <A name=C23V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate said unto the chief priests 
and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man. <A name=C23V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they were the 
more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, 
and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. <A name=C23V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Pilate 
heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. <A name=C23V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he knew 
that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also 
was at Jerusalem in these days. <A name=C23V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was 
exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had 
heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. <A 
name=C23V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he questioned him in many words; 
but he answered him nothing. <A name=C23V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief priests and the scribes 
stood, vehemently accusing him. <A name=C23V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Herod with his soldiers set him at 
nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to 
Pilate. <A name=C23V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Herod and Pilate became friends 
with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between 
themselves. <A name=C23V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate called together the chief 
priests and the rulers and the people, <A name=C23V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said unto them, Ye brought unto me 
this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him 
before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse 
him: <A name=C23V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him 
back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. <A 
name=C23V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will therefore chastise him, and 
release him. <A name=C23V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>Now he must needs release unto them 
at the feast one prisoner.</I> <A name=C23V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they cried out all together, 
saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: -- <A 
name=C23V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>one who for a certain insurrection 
made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison. <A name=C23V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate spake 
unto them again, desiring to release Jesus; <A name=C23V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but they shouted, 
saying, Crucify, crucify him. <A name=C23V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them the third time, 
Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will 
therefore chastise him and release him. <A name=C23V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they were urgent with loud voices, 
asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. <A 
name=C23V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate gave sentence that what 
they asked for should be done. <A name=C23V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he released him that for 
insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but 
Jesus he delivered up to their will. <A name=C23V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they led him away, they laid 
hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the 
cross, to bear it after Jesus. <A name=C23V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there followed him a great 
multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. <A 
name=C23V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus turning unto them said, 
Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your 
children. <A name=C23V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For behold, the days are coming, in 
which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and 
the breasts that never gave suck. <A name=C23V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then shall they begin to say to the 
mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. <A name=C23V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if they do 
these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry? <A 
name=C23V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were also two others, 
malefactors, led with him to be put to death. <A name=C23V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they came 
unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the 
malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left. <A 
name=C23V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; 
for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast 
lots. <A name=C23V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the people stood beholding. And 
the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, 
if this is the Christ of God, his chosen. <A name=C23V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the soldiers 
also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar, <A name=C23V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saying, If 
thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself. <A name=C23V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was also 
a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <A name=C23V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of the 
malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? 
save thyself and us. <A name=C23V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the other answered, and rebuking 
him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
<A name=C23V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And we indeed justly; for we receive 
the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. <A 
name=C23V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Jesus, remember me when 
thou comest in thy kingdom. <A name=C23V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto him, Verily I say 
unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. <A name=C23V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was now 
about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth 
hour, <A name=C23V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>the sun's light failing: and the veil 
of the temple was rent in the midst. <A name=C23V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, 
said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave 
up the ghost. <A name=C23V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the centurion saw what was 
done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. <A 
name=C23V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the multitudes that came 
together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned 
smiting their breasts. <A name=C23V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all his acquaintance, and the 
women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things. 
<A name=C23V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, a man named Joseph, who 
was a councillor, a good and righteous man <A name=C23V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(he had not 
consented to their counsel and deed), <I>a man</I> of Arimathaea, a city of the 
Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God: <A name=C23V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>this man went to 
Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. <A name=C23V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>23:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took it 
down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in 
stone, where never man had yet lain. <A name=C23V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was the day of the Preparation, 
and the sabbath drew on. <A name=C23V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the women, who had come with him 
out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid. 
<A name=C23V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>23:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they returned, and prepared spices 
and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment. 
<P>
<P><A name=C24V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But on the first day of the week, at 
early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had 
prepared. <A name=C24V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they found the stone rolled away 
from the tomb. <A name=C24V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they entered in, and found not the 
body of the Lord Jesus. <A name=C24V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, while they were 
perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel: <A 
name=C24V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and as they were affrighted and bowed 
down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among 
the dead? <A name=C24V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is not here, but is risen: remember 
how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, <A name=C24V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying that the Son 
of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and 
the third day rise again. <A name=C24V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they remembered his words, <A 
name=C24V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and returned from the tomb, and told 
all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. <A name=C24V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now they were Mary 
Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the <I>mother</I> of James: and the other women 
with them told these things unto the apostles. <A name=C24V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And these words 
appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them. <A 
name=C24V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter arose, and ran unto the 
tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and 
he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass. <A 
name=C24V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, two of them were going 
that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from 
Jerusalem. <A name=C24V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they communed with each other of 
all these things which had happened. <A name=C24V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, while they 
communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with 
them. <A name=C24V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But their eyes were holden that they 
should not know him. <A name=C24V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, What 
communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they 
stood still, looking sad. <A name=C24V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of them, named Cleopas, 
answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the 
things which are come to pass there in these days? <A name=C24V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the 
Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the 
people: <A name=C24V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and how the chief priests and our 
rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <A 
name=C24V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we hoped that it was he who should 
redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these 
things came to pass. <A name=C24V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moreover certain women of our company 
amazed us, having been early at the tomb; <A name=C24V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when they 
found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of 
angels, who said that he was alive. <A name=C24V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And certain of them that were with us 
went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw 
not. <A name=C24V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, O foolish men, 
and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! <A 
name=C24V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behooved it not the Christ to suffer 
these things, and to enter into his glory? <A name=C24V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And beginning from 
Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures 
the things concerning himself. <A name=C24V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they drew nigh unto the village, 
whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further. <A 
name=C24V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they constrained him, saying, 
Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he 
went in to abide with them. <A name=C24V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, when he had sat 
down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking <I>it</I> he 
gave to them. <A name=C24V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <A name=C24V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they said one 
to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the 
way, while he opened to us the scriptures? <A name=C24V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they rose up 
that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered 
together, and them that were with them, <A name=C24V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and 
hath appeared to Simon. <A name=C24V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they rehearsed the things <I>that 
happened</I> in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the 
bread. <A name=C24V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they spake these things, he 
himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <I>be</I> unto 
you. <A name=C24V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they were terrified and 
affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. <A name=C24V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart? <A 
name=C24V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>See my hands and my feet, that it is I 
myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold 
me having. <A name=C24V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had said this, he showed 
them his hands and his feet. <A name=C24V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while they still disbelieved for 
joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? <A 
name=C24V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they gave him a piece of a broiled 
fish. <A name=C24V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took it, and ate before them. 
<A name=C24V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, These are my 
words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must 
needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and 
the psalms, concerning me. <A name=C24V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then opened he their mind, that they 
might understand the scriptures; <A name=C24V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he said unto them, Thus it is 
written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third 
day; <A name=C24V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and that repentance and remission of 
sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from 
Jerusalem. <A name=C24V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye are witnesses of these things. <A 
name=C24V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And behold, I send forth the promise 
of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power 
from on high. <A name=C24V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he led them out until <I>they 
were</I> over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. <A 
name=C24V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>24:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, while he blessed 
them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. <A name=C24V52><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they 
worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: <A name=C24V53><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>24:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and were 
continually in the temple, blessing God.
