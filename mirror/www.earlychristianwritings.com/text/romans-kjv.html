<H3>Bible, King James Version  (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Romans</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an 
apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,<BR>[<B>2</B>] (Which he had promised 
afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<BR>[<B>3</B>] Concerning his Son 
Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the 
flesh;<BR>[<B>4</B>] And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to 
the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:<BR>[<B>5</B>] By whom 
we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all 
nations, for his name:<BR>[<B>6</B>] Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus 
Christ:<BR>[<B>7</B>] To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be 
saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus 
Christ.<BR>[<B>8</B>] First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, 
that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For God 
is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that 
without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey 
by the will of God to come unto you.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For I long to see you, that 
I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be 
established;<BR>[<B>12</B>] That is, that I may be comforted together with you 
by the mutual faith both of you and me.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Now I would not have you 
ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let 
hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other 
Gentiles.<BR>[<B>14</B>] I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; 
both to the wise, and to the unwise.<BR>[<B>15</B>] So, as much as in me is, I 
am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.<BR>[<B>16</B>] For I 
am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto 
salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the 
Greek.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from 
faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and 
unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<BR>[<B>19</B>] 
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed 
it unto them.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For the invisible things of him from the creation 
of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, 
even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without 
excuse:<BR>[<B>21</B>] Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not 
as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their 
foolish heart was darkened.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Professing themselves to be wise, 
they became fools,<BR>[<B>23</B>] And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God 
into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, 
and creeping things.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Wherefore God also gave them up to 
uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies 
between themselves:<BR>[<B>25</B>] Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and 
worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for 
ever. Amen.<BR>[<B>26</B>] For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: 
for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against 
nature:<BR>[<B>27</B>] And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the 
woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which 
is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which 
was meet.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And even as they did not like to retain God in their 
knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are 
not convenient;<BR>[<B>29</B>] Being filled with all unrighteousness, 
fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, 
debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<BR>[<B>30</B>] Backbiters, haters of God, 
despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to 
parents,<BR>[<B>31</B>] Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural 
affection, implacable, unmerciful:<BR>[<B>32</B>] Who knowing the judgment of 
God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the 
same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou 
art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for 
thou that judgest doest the same things.<BR>[<B>2</B>] But we are sure that the 
judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such 
things.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do 
such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of 
God?<BR>[<B>4</B>] Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance 
and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to 
repentance?<BR>[<B>5</B>] But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest 
up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous 
judgment of God;<BR>[<B>6</B>] Who will render to every man according to his 
deeds:<BR>[<B>7</B>] To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for 
glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:<BR>[<B>8</B>] But unto them that 
are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, 
indignation and wrath,<BR>[<B>9</B>] Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of 
man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, 
and also to the Gentile:<BR>[<B>11</B>] For there is no respect of persons with 
God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish 
without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the 
law;<BR>[<B>13</B>] (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the 
doers of the law shall be justified.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For when the Gentiles, which 
have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having 
not the law, are a law unto themselves:<BR>[<B>15</B>] Which shew the work of 
the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and 
their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one 
another;)<BR>[<B>16</B>] In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by 
Jesus Christ according to my gospel.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Behold, thou art called a 
Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,<BR>[<B>18</B>] And 
knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being 
instructed out of the law;<BR>[<B>19</B>] And art confident that thou thyself 
art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of 
knowledge and of the truth in the law.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Thou therefore which 
teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should 
not steal, dost thou steal?<BR>[<B>22</B>] Thou that sayest a man should not 
commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou 
commit sacrilege?<BR>[<B>23</B>] Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through 
breaking the law dishonourest thou God?<BR>[<B>24</B>] For the name of God is 
blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.<BR>[<B>25</B>] For 
circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of 
the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Therefore if 
the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his 
uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And shall not 
uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the 
letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?<BR>[<B>28</B>] For he is not a 
Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in 
the flesh:<BR>[<B>29</B>] But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and 
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose 
praise is not of men, but of God.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is 
there of circumcision?<BR>[<B>2</B>] Much every way: chiefly, because that unto 
them were committed the oracles of God.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For what if some did not 
believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without 
effect?<BR>[<B>4</B>] God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as 
it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest 
overcome when thou art judged.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But if our unrighteousness commend 
the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh 
vengeance? (I speak as a man)<BR>[<B>6</B>] God forbid: for then how shall God 
judge the world?<BR>[<B>7</B>] For if the truth of God hath more abounded 
through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a 
sinner?<BR>[<B>8</B>] And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as 
some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is 
just.<BR>[<B>9</B>] What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we 
have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under 
sin;<BR>[<B>10</B>] As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not 
one:<BR>[<B>11</B>] There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh 
after God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] They are all gone out of the way, they are together 
become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the 
poison of asps is under their lips:<BR>[<B>14</B>] Whose mouth is full of 
cursing and bitterness:<BR>[<B>15</B>] Their feet are swift to shed 
blood:<BR>[<B>16</B>] Destruction and misery are in their ways:<BR>[<B>17</B>] 
And the way of peace have they not known:<BR>[<B>18</B>] There is no fear of God 
before their eyes.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Now we know that what things soever the law 
saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, 
and all the world may become guilty before God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Therefore by the 
deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law 
is the knowledge of sin.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But now the righteousness of God without 
the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the 
prophets;<BR>[<B>22</B>] Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of 
Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no 
difference:<BR>[<B>23</B>] For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of 
God;<BR>[<B>24</B>] Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption 
that is in Christ Jesus:<BR>[<B>25</B>] Whom God hath set forth to be a 
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the 
remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and 
the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Where is boasting 
then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of 
faith.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith 
without the deeds of the law.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Is he the God of the Jews only? is 
he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:<BR>[<B>30</B>] Seeing it 
is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision 
through faith.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Do we then make void the law through faith? God 
forbid: yea, we establish the law.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as 
pertaining to the flesh, hath found?<BR>[<B>2</B>] For if Abraham were justified 
by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For what 
saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for 
righteousness.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned 
of grace, but of debt.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But to him that worketh not, but believeth 
on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for 
righteousness.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Even as David also describeth the blessedness of 
the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,<BR>[<B>7</B>] 
Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are 
covered.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute 
sin.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or 
upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for 
righteousness.<BR>[<B>10</B>] How was it then reckoned? when he was in 
circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in 
uncircumcision.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal 
of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he 
might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; 
that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:<BR>[<B>12</B>] And the 
father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who 
also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being 
yet uncircumcised.<BR>[<B>13</B>] For the promise, that he should be the heir of 
the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the 
righteousness of faith.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For if they which are of the law be 
heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no 
transgression.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by 
grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only 
which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is 
the father of us all,<BR>[<B>17</B>] (As it is written, I have made thee a 
father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth 
the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they 
were.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the 
father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed 
be.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body 
now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of 
Sara's womb:<BR>[<B>20</B>] He staggered not at the promise of God through 
unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;<BR>[<B>21</B>] And being 
fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to 
perform.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And therefore it was imputed to him for 
righteousness.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it 
was imputed to him;<BR>[<B>24</B>] But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, 
if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our 
justification.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with 
God through our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR>[<B>2</B>] By whom also we have access by 
faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of 
God.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing 
that tribulation worketh patience;<BR>[<B>4</B>] And patience, experience; and 
experience, hope:<BR>[<B>5</B>] And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of 
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto 
us.<BR>[<B>6</B>] For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died 
for the ungodly.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: 
yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But 
God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ 
died for us.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we 
shall be saved from wrath through him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For if, when we were 
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being 
reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And not only so, but 
we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received 
the atonement.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the 
world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have 
sinned:<BR>[<B>13</B>] (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not 
imputed when there is no law.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Nevertheless death reigned from 
Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's 
transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But not 
as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many 
be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, 
Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And not as it was by one 
that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but 
the free gift is of many offences unto justification.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For if by 
one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance 
of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus 
Christ.)<BR>[<B>18</B>] Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon 
all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came 
upon all men unto justification of life.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For as by one man's 
disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be 
made righteous.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Moreover the law entered, that the offence might 
abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:<BR>[<B>21</B>] That 
as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness 
unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that 
grace may abound?<BR>[<B>2</B>] God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, 
live any longer therein?<BR>[<B>3</B>] Know ye not, that so many of us as were 
baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?<BR>[<B>4</B>] Therefore 
we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up 
from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness 
of life.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For if we have been planted together in the likeness of 
his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<BR>[<B>6</B>] 
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might 
be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For he that 
is dead is freed from sin.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Now if we be dead with Christ, we 
believe that we shall also live with him:<BR>[<B>9</B>] Knowing that Christ 
being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over 
him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he 
liveth, he liveth unto God.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to 
be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our 
Lord.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye 
should obey it in the lusts thereof.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Neither yield ye your 
members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto 
God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of 
righteousness unto God.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For sin shall not have dominion over you: 
for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<BR>[<B>15</B>] What then? shall 
we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God 
forbid.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to 
obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of 
obedience unto righteousness?<BR>[<B>17</B>] But God be thanked, that ye were 
the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine 
which was delivered you.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Being then made free from sin, ye became 
the servants of righteousness.<BR>[<B>19</B>] I speak after the manner of men 
because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members 
servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your 
members servants to righteousness unto holiness.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For when ye were 
the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.<BR>[<B>21</B>] What fruit 
had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those 
things is death.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But now being made free from sin, and become 
servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting 
life.<BR>[<B>23</B>] For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is 
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know 
the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he 
liveth?<BR>[<B>2</B>] For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to 
her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from 
the law of her husband.<BR>[<B>3</B>] So then if, while her husband liveth, she 
be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband 
be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be 
married to another man.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become 
dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, 
even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto 
God.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which 
were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto 
death.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead 
wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the 
oldness of the letter.<BR>[<B>7</B>] What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God 
forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, 
except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But sin, taking 
occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For 
without the law sin was dead.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For I was alive without the law 
once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And 
the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto 
death.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, 
and by it slew me.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment 
holy, and just, and good.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Was then that which is good made death 
unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by 
that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding 
sinful.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, 
sold under sin.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For that which I do I allow not: for what I 
would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.<BR>[<B>16</B>] If then I do 
that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.<BR>[<B>17</B>] 
Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to 
will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find 
not.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I 
would not, that I do.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Now if I do that I would not, it is no more 
I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<BR>[<B>21</B>] I find then a law, 
that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For I 
delight in the law of God after the inward man:<BR>[<B>23</B>] But I see another 
law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into 
captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.<BR>[<B>24</B>] O wretched 
man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve 
the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] There is therefore now no condemnation to them which 
are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the 
Spirit.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath 
made me free from the law of sin and death.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For what the law could 
not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the 
likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after 
the flesh, but after the Spirit.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For they that are after the flesh 
do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things 
of the Spirit.<BR>[<B>6</B>] For to be carnally minded is death; but to be 
spiritually minded is life and peace.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Because the carnal mind is 
enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can 
be.<BR>[<B>8</B>] So then they that are in the flesh cannot please 
God.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that 
the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he 
is none of his.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because 
of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.<BR>[<B>11</B>] But if 
the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that 
raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his 
Spirit that dwelleth in you.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, 
not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.<BR>[<B>13</B>] For if ye live after 
the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of 
the body, ye shall live.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For as many as are led by the Spirit of 
God, they are the sons of God.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For ye have not received the 
spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, 
whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<BR>[<B>16</B>] The Spirit itself beareth witness 
with our spirit, that we are the children of God:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And if 
children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that 
we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For I 
reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared 
with the glory which shall be revealed in us.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For the earnest 
expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of 
God.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, 
but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,<BR>[<B>21</B>] Because 
the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into 
the glorious liberty of the children of God.<BR>[<B>22</B>] For we know that the 
whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until 
now.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the 
firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for 
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For we are 
saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth 
he yet hope for?<BR>[<B>25</B>] But if we hope for that we see not, then do we 
with patience wait for it.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our 
infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit 
itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be 
uttered.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the 
mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to 
the will of God.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And we know that all things work together for 
good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his 
purpose.<BR>[<B>29</B>] For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be 
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many 
brethren.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: 
and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also 
glorified.<BR>[<B>31</B>] What shall we then say to these things? If God be for 
us, who can be against us?<BR>[<B>32</B>] He that spared not his own Son, but 
delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all 
things?<BR>[<B>33</B>] Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It 
is God that justifieth.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ 
that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of 
God, who also maketh intercession for us.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Who shall separate us 
from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or 
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<BR>[<B>36</B>] As it is written, For 
thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the 
slaughter.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors 
through him that loved us.<BR>[<B>38</B>] For I am persuaded, that neither 
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, 
nor things to come,<BR>[<B>39</B>] Nor height, nor depth, nor any other 
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ 
Jesus our Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience 
also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,<BR>[<B>2</B>] That I have great 
heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For I could wish that 
myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the 
flesh:<BR>[<B>4</B>] Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and 
the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, 
and the promises;<BR>[<B>5</B>] Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning 
the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. 
Amen.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For 
they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:<BR>[<B>7</B>] Neither, because 
they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy 
seed be called.<BR>[<B>8</B>] That is, They which are the children of the flesh, 
these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted 
for the seed.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For this is the word of promise, At this time will I 
come, and Sara shall have a son.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And not only this; but when 
Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;<BR>[<B>11</B>] (For 
the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the 
purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that 
calleth;)<BR>[<B>12</B>] It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the 
younger.<BR>[<B>13</B>] As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I 
hated.<BR>[<B>14</B>] What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? 
God forbid.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I 
will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have 
compassion.<BR>[<B>16</B>] So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him 
that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For the scripture 
saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I 
might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all 
the earth.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, 
and whom he will he hardeneth.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Thou wilt say then unto me, Why 
doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?<BR>[<B>20</B>] Nay but, 
O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him 
that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?<BR>[<B>21</B>] Hath not the potter 
power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and 
another unto dishonour?<BR>[<B>22</B>] What if God, willing to shew his wrath, 
and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of 
wrath fitted to destruction:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And that he might make known the 
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto 
glory,<BR>[<B>24</B>] Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but 
also of the Gentiles?<BR>[<B>25</B>] As he saith also in Osee, I will call them 
my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not 
beloved.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it 
was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the 
children of the living God.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, 
Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant 
shall be saved:<BR>[<B>28</B>] For he will finish the work, and cut it short in 
righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the 
earth.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had 
left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto 
Gomorrha.<BR>[<B>30</B>] What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which 
followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the 
righteousness which is of faith.<BR>[<B>31</B>] But Israel, which followed after 
the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of 
righteousness.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, 
but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that 
stumblingstone;<BR>[<B>33</B>] As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a 
stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be 
ashamed.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for 
Israel is, that they might be saved.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For I bear them record that 
they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For they 
being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own 
righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of 
God.<BR>[<B>4</B>] For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every 
one that believeth.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For Moses describeth the righteousness which 
is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by 
them.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this 
wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring 
Christ down from above:)<BR>[<B>7</B>] Or, Who shall descend into the deep? 
(that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)<BR>[<B>8</B>] But what saith 
it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the 
word of faith, which we preach;<BR>[<B>9</B>] That if thou shalt confess with 
thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised 
him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For with the heart man 
believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto 
salvation.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him 
shall not be ashamed.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For there is no difference between the Jew 
and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon 
him.<BR>[<B>13</B>] For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be 
saved.<BR>[<B>14</B>] How then shall they call on him in whom they have not 
believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how 
shall they hear without a preacher?<BR>[<B>15</B>] And how shall they preach, 
except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that 
preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good 
things!<BR>[<B>16</B>] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias 
saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?<BR>[<B>17</B>] So then faith cometh 
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.<BR>[<B>18</B>] But I say, Have they 
not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto 
the ends of the world.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But I say, Did not Israel know? First 
Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a 
foolish nation I will anger you.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But Esaias is very bold, and 
saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them 
that asked not after me.<BR>[<B>21</B>] But to Israel he saith, All day long I 
have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. 
For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of 
Benjamin.<BR>[<B>2</B>] God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot 
ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God 
against Israel, saying,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and 
digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my 
life.<BR>[<B>4</B>] But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved 
to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of 
Baal.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant 
according to the election of grace.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And if by grace, then is it no 
more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is 
it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.<BR>[<B>7</B>] What then? 
Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath 
obtained it, and the rest were blinded<BR>[<B>8</B>] (According as it is 
written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not 
see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And David 
saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a 
recompence unto them:<BR>[<B>10</B>] Let their eyes be darkened, that they may 
not see, and bow down their back alway.<BR>[<B>11</B>] I say then, Have they 
stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall 
salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to 
jealousy.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and 
the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their 
fulness?<BR>[<B>13</B>] For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the 
apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:<BR>[<B>14</B>] If by any means I 
may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of 
them.<BR>[<B>15</B>] For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the 
world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the 
dead?<BR>[<B>16</B>] For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and 
if the root be holy, so are the branches.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And if some of the 
branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among 
them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive 
tree;<BR>[<B>18</B>] Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou 
bearest not the root, but the root thee.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Thou wilt say then, The 
branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Well; 
because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not 
highminded, but fear:<BR>[<B>21</B>] For if God spared not the natural branches, 
take heed lest he also spare not thee.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Behold therefore the 
goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, 
goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut 
off.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be 
graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For if thou 
wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed 
contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be 
the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?<BR>[<B>25</B>] For I 
would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should 
be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, 
until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And so all Israel 
shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, 
and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:<BR>[<B>27</B>] For this is my 
covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.<BR>[<B>28</B>] As 
concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the 
election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.<BR>[<B>29</B>] For the gifts 
and calling of God are without repentance.<BR>[<B>30</B>] For as ye in times 
past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their 
unbelief:<BR>[<B>31</B>] Even so have these also now not believed, that through 
your mercy they also may obtain mercy.<BR>[<B>32</B>] For God hath concluded 
them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.<BR>[<B>33</B>] O the 
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable 
are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!<BR>[<B>34</B>] For who hath 
known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?<BR>[<B>35</B>] Or 
who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him 
again?<BR>[<B>36</B>] For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: 
to whom be glory for ever. Amen.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of 
God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, 
which is your reasonable service.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And be not conformed to this 
world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove 
what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For I 
say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to 
think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, 
according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<BR>[<B>4</B>] For 
as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same 
office:<BR>[<B>5</B>] So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one 
members one of another.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Having then gifts differing according to 
the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to 
the proportion of faith;<BR>[<B>7</B>] Or ministry, let us wait on our 
ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;<BR>[<B>8</B>] Or he that 
exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he 
that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with 
cheerfulness.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which 
is evil; cleave to that which is good.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Be kindly affectioned one 
to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in 
prayer;<BR>[<B>13</B>] Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to 
hospitality.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse 
not.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that 
weep.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high 
things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own 
conceits.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things 
honest in the sight of all men.<BR>[<B>18</B>] If it be possible, as much as 
lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Dearly beloved, avenge 
not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance 
is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Therefore if thine enemy 
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap 
coals of fire on his head.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome 
evil with good.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For 
there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of 
God.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the 
ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves 
damnation.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the 
evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou 
shalt have praise of the same:<BR>[<B>4</B>] For he is the minister of God to 
thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not 
the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath 
upon him that doeth evil.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not 
only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.<BR>[<B>6</B>] For for this cause 
pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon 
this very thing.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to 
whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom 
honour.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that 
loveth another hath fulfilled the law.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For this, Thou shalt not 
commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear 
false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it 
is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
thyself.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is 
the fulfilling of the law.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And that, knowing the time, that now 
it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when 
we believed.<BR>[<B>12</B>] The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us 
therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of 
light.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and 
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and 
envying.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not 
provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to 
doubtful disputations.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For one believeth that he may eat all 
things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Let not him that 
eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him 
that eateth: for God hath received him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Who art thou that judgest 
another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall 
be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.<BR>[<B>5</B>] One man esteemeth 
one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully 
persuaded in his own mind.<BR>[<B>6</B>] He that regardeth the day, regardeth it 
unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard 
it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that 
eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For 
none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For 
whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the 
Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For to 
this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of 
the dead and living.<BR>[<B>10</B>] But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why 
dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment 
seat of Christ.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, 
every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to 
God.<BR>[<B>12</B>] So then every one of us shall give account of himself to 
God.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge 
this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his 
brother's way.<BR>[<B>14</B>] I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that 
there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be 
unclean, to him it is unclean.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But if thy brother be grieved with 
thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for 
whom Christ died.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Let not then your good be evil spoken 
of:<BR>[<B>17</B>] For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but 
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For he that 
in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of 
men.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Let us therefore follow after the things which make for 
peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For meat 
destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that 
man who eateth with offence.<BR>[<B>21</B>] It is good neither to eat flesh, nor 
to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or 
is made weak.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. 
Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he 
alloweth.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he 
eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities 
of the weak, and not to please ourselves.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Let every one of us 
please his neighbour for his good to edification.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For even Christ 
pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that 
reproached thee fell on me.<BR>[<B>4</B>] For whatsoever things were written 
aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of 
the scriptures might have hope.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Now the God of patience and 
consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ 
Jesus:<BR>[<B>6</B>] That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even 
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Wherefore receive ye one 
another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Now I say 
that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to 
confirm the promises made unto the fathers:<BR>[<B>9</B>] And that the Gentiles 
might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess 
to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And again he 
saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And again, Praise 
the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to 
reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Now the 
God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in 
hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And I myself also am 
persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with 
all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Nevertheless, 
brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you 
in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,<BR>[<B>16</B>] That I 
should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel 
of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being 
sanctified by the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>17</B>] I have therefore whereof I may 
glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not 
wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,<BR>[<B>19</B>] 
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that 
from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel 
of Christ.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where 
Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's 
foundation:<BR>[<B>21</B>] But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, 
they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to 
you.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But now having no more place in these parts, and having a 
great desire these many years to come unto you;<BR>[<B>24</B>] Whensoever I take 
my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, 
and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled 
with your company.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto 
the saints.<BR>[<B>26</B>] For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to 
make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at 
Jerusalem.<BR>[<B>27</B>] It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they 
are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, 
their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.<BR>[<B>28</B>] When 
therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come 
by you into Spain.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I 
shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of 
Christ.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's 
sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your 
prayers to God for me;<BR>[<B>31</B>] That I may be delivered from them that do 
not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be 
accepted of the saints;<BR>[<B>32</B>] That I may come unto you with joy by the 
will of God, and may with you be refreshed.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Now the God of peace 
be with you all. Amen.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Rom.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a 
servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:<BR>[<B>2</B>] That ye receive her in 
the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she 
hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself 
also.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ 
Jesus:<BR>[<B>4</B>] Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom 
not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved 
Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Greet 
Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Salute Andronicus and Junia, 
my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also 
were in Christ before me.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Greet Amplias my beloved in the 
Lord.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my 
beloved.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are 
of Aristobulus' household.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them 
that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, 
which laboured much in the Lord.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, 
and his mother and mine.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, 
Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Salute 
Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints 
which are with them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Salute one another with an holy kiss. The 
churches of Christ salute you.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Now I beseech you, brethren, mark 
them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have 
learned; and avoid them.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For they that are such serve not our 
Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches 
deceive the hearts of the simple.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For your obedience is come 
abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have 
you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Timotheus my workfellow, and 
Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.<BR>[<B>22</B>] I 
Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Gaius 
mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the 
city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.<BR>[<B>24</B>] The grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Now to him that is of power 
to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, 
according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the 
world began,<BR>[<B>26</B>] But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of 
the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to 
all nations for the obedience of faith:<BR>[<B>27</B>] To God only wise, be 
glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.<BR>
