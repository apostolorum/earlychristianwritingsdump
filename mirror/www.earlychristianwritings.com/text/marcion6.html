22: 1 	Now the feast of unleavened bread was coming near, <br>
	which is called the Passover. <br>
2  	And the chief priests and scribes were seeking <br>
	how they might kill him; for they feared the people. <br>
3  	Then Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, <br>
	being of the number of the twelve, went away, <br>
4 	And communed with the chief priests and captains, <br>
	how he might deliver him up to them. <br>

7 	Then the day of unleavened bread came, <br>
	when the passover must be sacrificed. <br>
8  	And he [said] unto Peter and [the rest],<br>
	Go and make ready that we may eat the passover. <br>

9  	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready? <br>
10  	And he said unto them, <br>
	Behold, when ye have entered into the city, <br>
	a man shall meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; <br>
	follow him into the house whereinto he goeth. <br>
11  	And ye shall say unto the master of the house, <br>
	The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the lodging, <br>
	where I may eat the passover with my disciples? <br>
12  	And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: <br>
	there make ready. <br>
13  	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: <br>
	and they made ready the passover. <br><p>

17  	[ And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <br>
	Take this, and divide it among yourselves: <br>

	until the kingdom of God shall come.] <br>

19  	And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, <br>
	and gave to them, saying, <br>
	This is my body which is given for you: <br>
	this do for my remembrance. <br>
20  	And in like manner the cup after supper, saying, <br>
	This cup is the [new] covenant in my blood, <br>
	even that which is poured out for you. <br>

21 	But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <br>
	is with me on the table. <br>
22  	And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: <br>
	but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed! <br>
23  	And they began to dispute with themselves, <br>
	which of them it was that was going to do this thing. <br>
<p>
24  	And there was also a contention among them, <br>
	which of them is accounted to be greater. <br>
25  	And he said unto them, <br>
	The kings of the nations have lordship over them; <br>
	and they that have authority over them are called benefactors. <br>
26  	But ye shall not be so: <br>
	but he that is the greater among you, let him be as the younger; <br>
	and he that leadeth as he that serveth. <br>
27  	For whether is greater- <br>
	he that reclineth at meat, or he that serveth? <br>
	is not he that reclineth? <br>
	But I am in the midst of you as he that serveth. <br>
28  	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. <br>
29  	And I appoint unto you even as my Father hath appointed unto me, <br>
	A kingdom. <br>

42  	Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: <br>
	nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. <br>

59  	And after a space of about one hour <br>
	another confidently affirmed, saying, <br>

2  	And they began to accuse him, saying, <br>

7  	And when he knew that he was from Herod's jurisdiction, <br>he sent him up to Herod, <br>

	and was hoping to see some sign done by him. <br>
9  	And he questioned him in many words; <br>
	but he answered him nothing. <br>
10  	And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him. <br>
11  	And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, <br>
	and mocked him, and arraying him in a gorgeous robe, <br>
	sent him back to Pilate. <br>

19  	(one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, <br>
	had been cast into prison.) <br>
20  	Pilate therefore spake again to them, wishing to release Jesus. <br>
<p>
21  	But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. <br>
22  	And he said unto them the third time, <br>
	Why, what evil hath this man done? <br>
	I have found no cause of death in him: <br>
	I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. <br>
23  	But they were urgent with loud voices, <br>
	asking that he might be crucified. <br>
	And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. <br>
24  	And Pilate gave sentence that their request should be done. <br>
25  	And he released unto them him that for insurrection and murder <br>
	had been cast into prison, whom they were sking for; <br>
	but Jesus he delivered up to their will. <br>

26 	And as they led him away, <br>
	they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, <br>
	that was coming out of the country, <br>
	and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus. <br>
27  	And there followed him a great company of the people, <br>
	and of women, who also were bewailing and lamenting  him. <br>
28  	But Jesus turning unto them said, <br>
	Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, <br>
	but weep for yourselves, and for your children. <br>
29  	For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, <br>
	Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that bare not, <br>
	and the breasts that gave not suck. <br>
30  	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; <br>
	and to the hills, Cover us. <br>
31  	For if they do these things in the green tree, <br>
	what shall be done in the dry? <br>

32 	And there were also two other, malefactors, <br>
	led with him to be put to death. <br>
33 	And when they were come to the place, which is called the Skull, <br>
	there they crucified him, and the malefactors, <br>
	one on the right hand, and the other on the left. <br>
34[-34c] Then said Jesus, <br>
	Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. <br>	
35  	And the people stood beholding. <br>
	And the rulers also with them scoffed at him, saying, <br>
	Others he saved; let him save himself, <br>
	if this is Christ, the chosen of God. <br>
36  	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, <br>
	and offering him vinegar, and saying, <br>
37  	If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. <br>
38  	And a superscription also was written over him <br>
	in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, <br>
	THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <br>
<p>
39  	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, <br>
	If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. <br>
40  	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, <br>
	Dost not thou fear God, because thou art in the same condemnation? <br>
41  	And we indeed justly; for we receive things worthy of our deeds: <br>
	but this man did nothing amiss. <br>
42  	And he said unto Jesus, <br>
	Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. <br>
43  	And Jesus said unto him, <br>
	Verily I say unto thee, To day thou shalt be with me. <br><A HREF="../web/20091023075413/http_/geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Epip14.html">Panarion 42</A><BR>

	and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <br>
45  	And the sun was darkened, <br>
	and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in the midst. <br>

	[a man] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: <br>

	bringing the spices which they had prepared, <br>

5  	And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, <br>

13 	And, behold, two of them went that very day <br>
	to a village called Emmaus, <br>
	sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem . <br>
14  	And they talked together of all these things <br>
	which had happened. <br>
15  	And it came to pass, that, <br>
	while they communed and questioned together , <br>
	Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. <br>
16  	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. <br>
17  	And he said unto them, <br>
	What words are these that ye exchange with each other, <br>
	as ye walk, and are sad of countenance? <br>
18  	And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, <br>
	answering said unto him, <br>
	Dost thou alone  sojourn in Jerusalem, and not know the things<br> 
	which are come to pass there in these days? <br>
19  	And he said unto them, What things? <br>
<p>
	And they said unto him, <br>
	The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, <br>
	which was a prophet mighty in deed and word <br>
	before God and all the people: <br>
20  	And how the chief priests and our rulers <br>
	delivered him up to  a sentence of death, <br>
	and crucified him. <br>
21  	But we hopeded that it had been he, <br>
	who is going to redeem Israel: <br>
	yea, and beside all this, to day is the third day <br>
	since these things occurred. <br>
22  	Yea, and certain women also of our company astonished us, <br>
	who had been early at the tomb; <br>
23  	And when they found not his body, they came, saying, <br>
	that they had also seen a vision of angels, <br>
	which said that he was alive. <br>

	to have suffered these things, <br>
