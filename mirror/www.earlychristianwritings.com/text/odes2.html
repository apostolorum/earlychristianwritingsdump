	<p>From<em> The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten       Books of Eden</em>.</p> <p>Ode 1</p> <p>1 The Lord is on my head like a crown, and I shall not be without Him.       2 They wove for me a crown of truth, and it caused thy branches to bud in       me. 3 For it is not like a withered crown which buddeth not: but thou       livest upon my head, and thou hast blossomed upon my head. 4 Thy fruits       are full-grown and perfect, they are full of thy salvation.</p> <p>Ode 2</p> <p><em>No part of this Ode has ever been identified</em></p> <p>Ode 3</p> <p><em>The first words of this Ode have disappeared</em>.</p> <p>1 ... I put on. 2 And his members are with him. And on them do I stand,       and He loves me: 3 For I should not have known love the Lord, if not loved       me. 4 For who is able to distinguish love except the one that is loved? 5.       I love the beloved and my soul loves Him: 6 And where His rest is, there       also am I; 7 And I shall be no strangers for with the Lord Most High and       Merciful there is no grudging. 8 I have been united to Him, for the Lover       has found the Beloved, 9 And because I shall love Him that is the Son, I       shall become a son;. 10 For he that is joined to Him that is immortal,       will also himself become immortal; 11 And he who has pleasure in the       Living One, will become living. 12 This is the Spirit of the Lord, which       doth not lie, which teacheth the sons of men to know His ways. 13 Be wise       and understanding and vigilant. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 4.</p> <p><em>This Ode is important because of the historical allusion with which       it commences. This may refer to the closing of the temple at Leontopolis       an Egypt which this writing about</em></p> <p>1 No man, O my God, changeth thy holy place; 2 And it is not (possible)       that he should change it and put it in another place: because he hath no       power over it: 3 For thy sanctuary thou hast designed before thou didst       make (other) places: 4 That which is the elder shall not be altered by       those that are younger than itself. 5 Thou has given thy heart, O Lord, to       thy believers: never wilt thou fail, nor be without fruits: 6 For one hour       of thy Faith is days and years. 7 For who is there put on thy grace, and       be hurt? 8 For thy seal is known: and thy creatures know it: and thy       (heavenly) hosts possess it: and the elect archangels are clad with it. 9       Thou hast given us thy fellowship: it was not that thou wast in need of       us: but that we are in need of thee: 10 Distill thy dews upon us and open       thy rich fountains that pour forth to us milk and honey: 11 For there is       no repentance with thee that thou shouldest repent of anything that thou       hast promised: 12 And the end was revealed before thee: for what thou       gavest, thou gavest freely: 13 So that thou mayest not draw them back and       take them again: 14 For all was revealed before thee as God, and ordered       from the beginning before thee: and thou, O God, hast made all things.       Hallelujah,</p> <p>ODE 5.</p> <p><em>This Ode has strangely appeared in a speech by Salome in another       ancient work called the Pistis Sophia.</em></p> <p>1 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, because I love thee; 2 O Most       High, thou wilt not forsake me for thou art my hope: 3 Freely I have       received thy grace, I shall live thereby: 4 My persecutors will come and       not see me: 5 A cloud of darkness shall fall on their eyes; and an air of       thick gloom shall darken them: 6 And they shall have no light to see: they       may not take hold upon me. 7 Let their counsel become thick darkness, and       what they have cunningly devised, let it return upon their own heads: 8       For they have devised a counsel and it did not succeed: 9 For my hope is       upon the Lord and I will not fear, and because the Lord is my salvation, I       will not fear: and He is a garland on my head and I shall not be moved;       even if everything should be shaken, I stand firm; 11 And if all things       visible should perish, I shall not die; because the Lord is with me I and       I am with Him. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 6.</p> <p><em>First century universalism is revealed in an       interesting way in verse 10.</em></p> <p>1 As the hand moves over the harp, and the strings speak, 2 So speaks       in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak by His love. 3 For it       destroys what is foreign and everything that is bitter: 4 For thus it was       from the beginning and will be to the end, that nothing should be His       adversary, and nothing should stand up against Him. 5 The Lord has       multiplied the knowledge of Himself, and is zealous that these things       should be known, which by His grace have been given to us. 6 And the       praise of His name He gave us: our spirits praise His holy Spirit. 7 For       there went forth a stream and became a river great and broad; 8 For it       flooded and broke up everything and it brought (water) to the Temple; 9       And the restrainers of the children of men were not able to restrain it,       nor the arts of those whose business it is to restrain waters; 10 For it       spread over the face of the whole earth, and filled everything: and all       the thirsty upon earth were given to drink of it; 11 And thirst was       relieved and quenched: for from the Most High the draught was given. 12       Blessed then are the ministers of that draught who are entrusted with that       water 13 They have assuaged the dry lips, and the will that had fainted       they have raised up; 14 And souls that were near departing they have       caught back from death: 15 And limbs that had fallen they straightened and       set up: 16 They gave strength for their feebleness and light to their       eyes: 17 For everyone knew them in the Lord, and they lived by the water       of life forever. Hallelujah.</p> <p>Ode 7</p> <p><em>A wonderfully, simple and joyful psalm on the       Incarnation.</em></p> <p>1 As the impulse of anger against evil, so is the impulse of joy over       what is lovely, and brings in of its fruits without restraint: 2 My joy is       the Lord and my impulse is toward Him: this path of mine is excellent: 3       For I have a helper, the Lord. 4 He hath caused me to know Himself,       without grudging, by His simplicity: His kindness has humbled His       greatness. 5 He became like me, in order that I might receive Him: He was       reckoned like myself in order that I might put Him on; 7 And I trembled       not when I saw Him: because He was gracious to me: 8 Like my nature He       became that I might learn Him and like my form, that I might not turn back       from Him: 9 The Father of knowledge is the word of knowledge: 10 He who       created wisdom is wiser than His works: 11 And He who created me when yet       I was not knew what I should do when I came into being: 12 Wherefore He       pitied me in His abundant grace: and granted me to ask from Him and to       receive from His sacrifice: 13 Because He it is that is incorrupt, the       fulness of the ages and the of them. 14 He hath given Him to be seen of       them that are His, in order that they may recognize Him that made them:       and that they might not suppose that they came of themselves: 15 For       knowledge He hath appointed as its way, hath widened it and extended it;       and brought to all perfection; 16 And set over it the traces of His light,       and I walked therein from the beginning even to the end. 17 For by Him it       was wrought, and He was resting in the Son, and for its salvation He will       take hold of everything. 18 And the Most High shall be known in His       Saints, to announce to those that have songs of the coming of the Lord: 19       That they may go forth to meet Him, and may sing to Him with joy and with       the harp of many tones: 20 The seers shall come before Him and they shall       be seen before Him, 21 And they shall praise the Lord for His love:       because He is near and beholdeth. 22 And hatred shall be taken from the       earth, and along with jealousy it shall be drowned: 23 For ignorance hath       been destroyed, because the knowledge of the Lord hath arrived. 24 They       who make songs shall sing the grace of the Lord Most High; 25 And they       shall bring their songs, and their heart shall be like the day: and like       the excellent beauty of the Lord their pleasant song; 26 And there shall       neither be anything that breathes without knowledge nor any that is dumb:       27 For He hath given a mouth to His creation, to open the voice of the       mouth towards Him, to praise Him: 28 Confess ye His power, and show forth       His grace. Hallelujah.</p> <p>Ode 8</p> <p><em>Note the sudden transition from the person of the Psalmist to the       person of the Lord (v. 10). This is like the canonical Psalter in style.</em></p> <p>1 Open ye, open ye your hearts to the exultation of the Lord: 2 And let       your love be multiplied from the heart and even to the lips, 3 To bring       forth fruit to the Lord, living [fruit], holy [fruit], and to talk with       watchfulness in His light. 4 Rise up, and stand erect, ye who sometime       were brought low: 5 Tell forth ye who were in silence, that your mouth       hath been opened. 6 Ye, therefore, that were despised be henceforth lifted       up, because your righteousness hath been exalted. 7 For the right hand of       the Lord is with you: and He is your helper: 8. And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">peace was       prepared for you, before ever your war was</span>. 9. Hear the word of       truth, and receive the knowledge of the Most High. 10 Your flesh has not       known what I am saying to you: neither have your hearts known what I am       showing to you. 11 Keep. my secret, ye who are kept by it. l2 Keep my       faith, ye who are kept by it. l3 And understand my knowledge, ye who know       me in truth, 14 Love me with affection, ye who love! 15 For I do not turn       away my face from them that are mine; 16 For I know them and before they       came into being I took knowledge of them, and on their faces I set my       seal: 17 I fashioned their members: my own breasts I prepared for them,       that they might drink my holy milk and live thereby 18 I took pleasure in       them and am not ashamed of them: 19 For my workmanship are they and the       strength of my thoughts: 20 Who then shall rise up against my handiwork,       or who is there that is not subject to them? 21 I willed and fashioned       mind and heart: and they are mine, and by my own right hand I set my elect       ones: 22 And my righteousness goeth before them and they shall not be       deprived of my name, for it is with them. 23 Ask, and abound and abide in       the love of the Lord, 24 And yet beloved ones in the Beloved: those who       are kept, in Him that liveth: 25 And they that are saved in Him that was       saved; 26 And ye shall be found incorrupt in all ages to the name of your       Father. Hallelujah.</p> <p>Ode 9</p> <p><em>We shall never know surely whether the wars referred to here are       spiritual or actual outward wars.</em></p> <p>1 Open your ears and I will speak to you. Give me your souls that I may       also give you my soul, 2 The word of the Lord and His good pleasures, the       holy thought which He has devised concerning his Messiah. 3 For in the       will of the Lord is your salvation, and His thought is everlasting life;       and your end is immortality. 4 Be enriched in God the Father, and receive       the thought of the Most High. 5 Be strong and be redeemed by His grace. 6       For I announce to you peace, to you His saints; 6 That none of those who       hear may fall in war, and that those again who have known Him may not       perish, and that those who receive may not be ashamed. 8 An everlasting       crown forever is Truth. Blessed are they who set it on their heads: 9 A       stone of great price is it; and there have been wars on account of the       crown. 10 And righteousness hath taken it and hath given it to you. 11 Put       on the crown in the true covenant of the Lord. 12 And all those who have       conquered shall be written in His book. 13 For their book is victory which       is yours. And she (Victory) sees you before her and wills that you shall       be saved. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 10.</p> <p><em>A vigorous little Ode in which Christ Himself is the       speaker.</em></p> <p>1 The Lord hath directed my mouth by His word: and He hath opened my       heart by His light: and He hath caused to dwell in me His deathless life;       2 And gave me that I might speak the fruit peace: 3 To convert the souls       of them who are willing to come to Him; and to lead captive a good       captivity for freedom. 4 I was strengthened and made mighty and took the       world captive; 5 And it became to me for the praise of the Most High, and       of God my Father. 6 And the Gentiles were gathered together who were       scattered abroad. 7 And I was unpolluted by my love for them, because they       confessed me in high places: and the traces of the light were set upon       their heart: 8 And they walked in my life and were saved and be came my       people for ever and ever. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 11.</p> <p><em>A beautiful sketch of Paradise regained and the blessedness of those       who have returned to the privileges of the fallen Adam.</em></p> <p>1 My heart was cloven and its flower appeared; and grace sprang up in       it: and it brought forth fruit to the Lord, 2 For the Most High clave my       heart by His Holy Spirit and searched my affection towards Him: and filled       me with His love. 3 And His opening of me became my salvation; and I ran       in His way in His peace even in the way of truth: 4 from the beginning and       even to the end I acquired His knowledge: 5 And I was established upon the       rock of truth, where He had set me up: 6 And speaking waters touched my       lips from the fountain of the Lord plenteously: 7 And I drank and was       inebriated with the living water that doth not die; 8 And my inebriation       was not one without knowledge, but I forsook vanity and turned to the Most       High my God, 9 And I was enriched by His bounty, and I forsook the folly       which is diffused over the earth; and I stripped it off and cast it from       me: 10 And the Lord renewed me in His raiment, and possessed me by His       light, and from above He gave me rest in incorruption; 11 And I became       like the land which blossoms and rejoices in its fruits: 12 And the Lord       was like the sun shining on the face of the land; 13 He lightened my eyes       and my face received the dew; the pleasant odour of the Lord; 14 And He       carried me to His Paradise; where is the abundance of the pleasure, of the       Lord; 15 And I worshipped the Lord on account of His glory; and I said,       Blessed, O Lord, are they who are planted in thy land and those who have a       place in thy Paradise; 16 And they grow by the fruits of the trees. And       they have changed from darkness to light. 17 Behold! all thy servants are       fair, who do good works, and turn away from wickedness to the pleasantness       that is thine: 18 And they have turned back the bitterness of the trees       from them, when they were planted in thy land; 19 And everything became       like a relic of thyself, and memorial for ever of thy faithful works. 20       For there is abundant room in thy Paradise, and nothing is useless       therein; 21 But everything is filled with fruit; glory be to thee, O God,       the delight of Paradise for ever. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 12.</p> <p><em>An exceptionally high level of spiritual thought.</em></p> <p>1 He hath filled me with words of truth; that I may speak the same; 2       And like the flow of waters flows truth from my mouth, and my lips show       forth His fruit. 3 And He has caused His knowledge to abound in me,       because the mouth of the Lord is the true Word, and the door of His light;       4 And the Most High hath given it to His words, which are the interpreters       of His own beauty, and the repeaters of His praise, and the confessors of       His counsel and the heralds of His thought and the chasteners of His       servants. 5 For the swiftness of the Word is inexpressible, and like its       expression is its swiftness and force; 6 And its course knows no limit.

Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 35.</p> <p><em>"No cradled child more softly lies than I: come       soon, eternity."</em></p> <p>1 The dew of the Lord in quietness He distilled upon me: 2 And the       cloud of peace He caused to rise over my head, which guarded me       continually; 3 It was to me for salvation: everything was shaken and they       were affrighted; 4 And there came forth from them a smoke and a judgment;       and I was keeping quiet in the order of the Lord: 5 More than shelter was       He to me and more than foundation. 6 And I was carried like a child by       mother: and He gave me milk, the dew of the Lord: 7 And I grew great by       His bounty, and rested in His perfection, 8 And I spread out my hands in       the lifting up of my soul: and I was made right with the Most High and I       was redeemed with Him. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 36.</p> <p><em>Theologians have never agreed on an explanation of       this perplexing Ode.</em></p> <p>1 I rested in the Spirit of the Lord: and the Spirit raised me on high:       2 And made me stand on my feet in the height of the Lord, before His       perfection and His glory, while I was praising Him by the composition of       His songs. 3 The Spirit brought me forth before the face of the Lord: and,       although a son of man, I was named the Illuminate, the Son of God: 4 While       I praised amongst the praising ones, and great was I amongst the mighty       ones. 5 For according to the greatness of the Most High, so He made me:       and like His own newness He renewed me; and He anointed me from His own       perfection: 6 And I became one of His Neighbours; and my mouth was opened;       like a cloud of dew; 7 And my heart poured out as it were a gushing stream       of righteousness, 8 And my access to Him was in peace; and I was       established by the Spirit of His government. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 37.</p> <p><em>An elementary Ode</em>.</p> <p>1 I stretched out my hands to my Lord: and to the Most High I raised my       voice: 2 And I spake with the lips of my heart; and He heard me when my       voice reached Him: 3 His answer came to me and gave me the fruits of my       labours; 4 And it gave me rest by the grace of the Lord. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 38.</p> <p><em>A beautiful description of the power of truth.</em></p> <p>1 I went up to the light of truth as if into a chariot: 2 And the Truth       took me and led me: and carried me across pits and gulleys; and from the       rocks and the waves it preserved me: 3 And it became to me a haven of       Salvation: and set me on the arms of immortal life: 4 And it went with me       and made me rest, and suffered me not to wander because it was the Truth.       5 And I ran no risk, because I walked with Him; 5 And I did not make an       error 4 anything because I obeyed the Truth. 7 For Error flees away from       it and meets it not: but the Truth proceeds in the right path, and 8 What       ever I did not know, it made clear to me, all the poisons of error, and       the plagues of death which they think to be sweetness: 9 And I saw the       destroyer of destruction, when the bride who is corrupted is adorned: and       the bridgegroom who corrupts and is corrupted; 10 And I asked the Truth,       'Who are these?'; and He said to me, 'This is the deceiver and the error:       11 And they are alike in the beloved and in his bride: and they lead       astray and corrupt the whole world: 12 And they invite many to the       banquet, 13 And give them to drink of the wine of their intoxication, and       remove their wisdom and knowledge, and so they make them without       intelligence; 14 And then they leave them; and then these go about like       madmen corrupting: seeing that they are with out heart, nor do they seek       for it.' 15 And I was made wise so as not to fall into the hands of the       deceiver; and I congratulated myself because the Truth went with me, 16       And I was established and lived and was redeemed, 17 And my foundations       were laid on the hand of the Lord: because He established me. 18 For He       set the root and watered it and fixed it and blessed it; and its fruits       are for ever. 19 It struck deep and sprung up and spread out and was full       and enlarged; 20 And the Lord alone was glorified in His planting and in       His husbandry: by His care and by the blessing of His lips, 21 By the       beautiful planting of His right hand: and by the discovery of His       planting, and by the thought of His mind. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 39.</p> <p><em>One of the few allusions to events in the Gospels ---that of our       Lord walking on the Sea of Galilee</em></p> <p>1 Great rivers are the power of the Lord: 2 And they carry headlong       those who despise Him: and entangle their paths: 3 And they sweep away       their fords, and catch their bodies and destroy their lives. 4 For they       are more swift than lightning and more rapid, and those who cross them in       faith are not moved; 5 And those who walk on them without blemish shall       not be afraid. 6 For the sign in them is the Lord; and the sign is the way       of those who cross in the name of the Lord; 7 Put on, therefore the name       of the Most High, and know Him and you shall cross without danger, for the       rivers will be subject to you. 8 The Lord has bridged them by His word;       and He walked and crossed them on foot: 9 And His footsteps stand firm on       the water, and are not injured; they are as firm as a tree that is truly       set up. 10 And the waves were lifted up on this side and on that, but the       footsteps of our Lord Messiah stand firm and are not obliterated and are       not defaced. 11 And a way has been appointed for those who cross after Him       and for those who adhere to the course of faith in Him and worship His       name. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 40.</p> <p><em>A song of praise without equal</em>.</p> <p>1 As the honey distills from the comb of the bees, 2 And the milk flows       from the woman that loves her children; 3 So also is my hope on Thee, my       God. 4 As the fountain gushes out its water. 5 So my heart gushes out the       praise of the Lord and my lips utter praise to Him, and my tongue His       psalms, 6 And my face exults with His gladness and my spirit exults in His       love and my soul shines in Him: 7 And reverence confides in Him; and       redemption in Him stands assured: 8 And His inheritance is immortal life,       and those who participate in it are incorrupt. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 41.</p> <p><em>We discover that the writer may be a Gentile (v. 8).</em></p> <p>1 All the Lord's children will praise Him, and will collect the truth       of His faith. 2 And His children shall be known to Him. Therefore we will       sing in His love: 3 We live in the Lord by His grace: and life we receive       in His Messiah: 4 For a great day has shined upon us: and marvellous is He       who has given us of His glory. 5 Let us, therefore all of us unite       together in the name of the Lord, and let us honour Him in His goodness, 6       And let our faces shine in His light: and let our hearts meditate in His       love by night and by day. 7 Let us exult with the joy of the Lord. 8 All       those will be astonished that see me, For from another race am I; 9 For       the Father of truth remembered me: He who possessed me from the beginning:       10 For His bounty begat me, and the thought of His heart: 11 And His Word       is with us in all our way; 12 The Saviour who makes alive and does not       reject our souls; 13 The man who was humbled, and exalted by His own       righteousness, 14 The Son of the Most High appeared in the perfection of       His Father; 15 And light dawned from the Word that was beforetime in Him;.       16 The Messiah is truly one; and He was known before the foundation of the       world, 17 That He might save souls forever by the truth of His name: a new       song arises from those who love Him. Hallelujah.</p> <p>ODE 42.</p> <p><em>The Odes of Solomon, the Son of David, are ended with       the following exquisite verses.</em></p> <p>1 I stretched out my hands and approached my Lord: 2 For the stretching       of my hands is His sign: 2 My expansion is the outspread tree which was       set up on the way of the Righteous One. 4 And I became of no account to       those who did not take hold of me and I shall be with those who love me. 5       All my persecutors are dead; and they sought after me who hoped in me,       because I was alive: 6 And I rose up and am with them; and I will speak by       their mouths. 7 For they have despised those who persecuted them; 8 And I       lifted up over them the yoke of my love; 9 Like the arm of the bridegroom       over the bride, 10 So was my yoke over those that know me: 11 And as the       couch that is spread in the house of the bridegroom and bride, 12 So is my       love over those that believe in me. 13 And I was not rejected though I was       reckoned to be so. 14 I did not perish, though they devised it against me.       13 Sheol saw me and was made miserable: 16 Death cast me up and many along       with me. 17 I had gall and bitterness, and I went down with him to the       utmost of his depth: 18 And the feet and the head he let go, for they were       not able to endure my face: 19 And I made a congregation of living men       amongst his dead men, and I spake with them by living lips: 20 Because my       word shall not be void: 21 And those who had died ran towards me: and they       cried and said, Son of God, have pity on us, and do with us according to       thy kindness. 22 And bring us out from the bonds of darkness: and open to       us the door by which we shall come out to thee. 23 For we see that our       death has not touched thee. 24 Let us also be redeemed with thee: for thou       art our Redeemer. 25 And I heard their voice; and my name I sealed upon       their heads: 26 For they are free men and they are mine. Hallelujah.</p>
