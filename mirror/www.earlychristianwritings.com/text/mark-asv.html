<H1>The Gospel According to Saint Mark </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God. <A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even as it is written in Isaiah the 
prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way. 
<A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The voice of one crying in the 
wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight; <A 
name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John 
came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto 
remission of sins. <A name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there went out unto him all the 
country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in 
the river Jordan, confessing their sins. <A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And John was clothed with camel's hair, 
and <I>had</I> a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild 
honey. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he preached, saying, There cometh 
after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy 
to stoop down and unloose. <A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I baptized you in water; But he shall 
baptize you in the Holy Spirit. <A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass in those days, that 
Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan. <A 
name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway coming up out of the 
water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon 
him: <A name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a voice came out of the heavens, 
Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. <A name=C1V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the 
Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness. <A name=C1V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he was in the 
wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the 
angels ministered unto him. <A name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after John was delivered up, Jesus 
came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, <A name=C1V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saying, The 
time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in 
the gospel. <A name=C1V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And passing along by the sea of 
Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; 
for they were fishers. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after 
me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. <A name=C1V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway 
they left the nets, and followed him. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And going on a little further, he saw 
James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat 
mending the nets. <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway he called them: and 
they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went 
after him. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they go into Capernaum; and 
straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. <A 
name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were astonished at his 
teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <A 
name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway there was in their 
synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, What have 
we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know 
thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy 
peace, and come out of him. <A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the unclean spirit, tearing him and 
crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <A name=C1V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were all 
amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a 
new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they 
obey him. <A name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the report of him went out 
straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about. <A 
name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway, when they were come 
out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James 
and John. <A name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a 
fever; and straightway they tell him of her: <A name=C1V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he came and 
took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she 
ministered unto them. <A name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And at even, when the sun did set, they 
brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons. 
<A name=C1V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And all the city was gathered together 
at the door. <A name=C1V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he healed many that were sick with 
divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to 
speak, because they knew him. <A name=C1V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And in the morning, a great while 
before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there 
prayed. <A name=C1V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Simon and they that were with him 
followed after him; <A name=C1V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they found him, and say unto him, 
All are seeking thee. <A name=C1V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, Let us go 
elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end 
came I forth. <A name=C1V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went into their synagogues 
throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. <A name=C1V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there cometh to 
him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If 
thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. <A name=C1V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And being moved with compassion, he 
stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou 
made clean. <A name=C1V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the leprosy departed 
from him, and he was made clean. <A name=C1V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he strictly charged him, and 
straightway sent him out, <A name=C1V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saith unto him, See thou say 
nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy 
cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <A 
name=C1V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he went out, and began to publish 
it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more 
openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him 
from every quarter. 
<P>
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he entered again into Capernaum 
after some days, it was noised that he was in the house. <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And many were 
gathered together, so that there was no longer room <I>for them</I>, no, not 
even about the door: and he spake the word unto them. <A name=C2V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they come, 
bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four. <A name=C2V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they could 
not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and 
when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy 
lay. <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto 
the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven. <A name=C2V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there were 
certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <A 
name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why 
doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, 
<I>even</I> God? <A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his 
spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye 
these things in your hearts? <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Which is easier, to say to the sick of 
the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and 
walk? <A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But that ye may know that the Son of 
man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), 
<A name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy 
bed, and go unto thy house. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he arose, and straightway took up 
the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and 
glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. <A name=C2V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went forth 
again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught 
them. <A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the 
<I>son</I> of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he saith unto him, 
Follow me. And he arose and followed him. <A name=C2V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to 
pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners 
sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed 
him. <A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when 
they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his 
disciples, <I>How is it</I> that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and 
sinners? <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto 
them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I 
came not to call the righteous, but sinners. <A name=C2V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And John's 
disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do 
John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast 
not? <A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons 
of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they 
have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. <A name=C2V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the days will 
come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast 
in that day. <A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No man seweth a piece of undressed 
cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the 
new from the old, and a worse rent is made. <A name=C2V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no man putteth 
new wine into old wineskins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine 
perisheth, and the skins: but <I>they put</I> new wine into fresh wine-skins. <A 
name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it came to pass, that he was going 
on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they 
went, to pluck the ears. <A name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Pharisees said unto him, 
Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? <A 
name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Did ye never 
read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were 
with him? <A name=C2V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How he entered into the house of God 
when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to 
eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him? <A 
name=C2V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, The sabbath was 
made for man, and not man for the sabbath: <A name=C2V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so that the Son of 
man is lord even of the sabbath. 
<P>
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he entered again into the synagogue; 
and there was a man there who had his hand withered. <A name=C3V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they watched 
him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 
<A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto the man that had his 
hand withered, Stand forth. <A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on 
the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they 
held their peace. <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he had looked round about on 
them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto 
the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was 
restored. <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Pharisees went out, and 
straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy 
him. <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to 
the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea, <A 
name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and 
Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him. <A 
name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the 
crowd, lest they should throng him: <A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he had healed many; insomuch that 
as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him. <A 
name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the unclean spirits, whensoever 
they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of 
God. <A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he charged them much that they 
should not make him known. <A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he goeth up into the mountain, and 
calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him. <A 
name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he appointed twelve, that they 
might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, <A 
name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to have authority to cast out 
demons: <A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Simon he surnamed Peter; <A 
name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, 
and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of 
thunder: <A name=C3V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Andrew, and Philip, and 
Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the <I>son</I> of Alphaeus, and 
Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, <A name=C3V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed 
him. And he cometh into a house. <A name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the multitude cometh together 
again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <A name=C3V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when his 
friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside 
himself. <A name=C3V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribes that came down from 
Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he 
out the demons. <A name=C3V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called them unto him, and said 
unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? <A name=C3V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if a kingdom be 
divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <A name=C3V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if a house be 
divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. <A 
name=C3V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if Satan hath rise up against 
himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. <A name=C3V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But no one can 
enter into the house of the strong <I>man</I>, and spoil his goods, except he 
first bind the strong <I>man</I>; and then he will spoil his house. <A 
name=C3V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto you, All their sins 
shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever 
they shall blaspheme: <A name=C3V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but whosoever shall blaspheme against 
the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin: <A 
name=C3V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because they said, He hath an unclean 
spirit. <A name=C3V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there come his mother and his 
brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him. <A 
name=C3V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a multitude was sitting about him; 
and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for 
thee. <A name=C3V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answereth them, and saith, Who 
is my mother and my brethren? <A name=C3V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And looking round on them that sat 
round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren! <A 
name=C3V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever shall do the will of God, 
the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

<P>
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again he began to teach by the sea 
side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered 
into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the 
land. <A name=C4V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he taught them many things in 
parables, and said unto them in his teaching, <A name=C4V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Hearken: Behold, the 
sower went forth to sow: <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and it came to pass, as he sowed, some 
<I>seed</I> fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it. <A 
name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
other fell on the rocky <I>ground</I>, where it had not much earth; and 
straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth: <A 
name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered 
away. <A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And other fell among the thorns, and the 
thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <A name=C4V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And others fell into 
the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought 
forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. <A name=C4V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Who 
hath ears to hear, let him hear. <A name=C4V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was alone, they that were 
about him with the twelve asked of him the parables. <A name=C4V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that 
are without, all things are done in parables: <A name=C4V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that seeing they 
may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest 
haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them. <A 
name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, Know ye not 
this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables? <A name=C4V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The sower soweth 
the word. <A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And these are they by the way side, 
where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and 
taketh away the word which hath been sown in them. <A name=C4V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And these in like 
manner are they that are sown upon the rocky <I>places</I>, who, when they have 
heard the word, straightway receive it with joy; <A name=C4V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they have no 
root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or 
persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble. <A 
name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And others are they that are sown among 
the thorns; these are they that have heard the word, <A name=C4V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the cares of 
the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things 
entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. <A name=C4V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And those are they 
that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and 
bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. <A name=C4V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, 
<I>and</I> not to be put on the stand? <A name=C4V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there is nothing hid, save that it 
should be manifested; neither was <I>anything</I> made secret, but that it 
should come to light. <A name=C4V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If any man hath ears to hear, let him 
hear. <A name=C4V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Take heed what 
ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall 
be given unto you. <A name=C4V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he that hath, to him shall be 
given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he 
hath. <A name=C4V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, 
as if a man should cast seed upon the earth; <A name=C4V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and should sleep 
and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not 
how. <A name=C4V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The earth beareth fruit of herself; 
first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. <A 
name=C4V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when the fruit is ripe, straightway 
he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come. <A name=C4V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, How 
shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth? <A 
name=C4V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It 
is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though 
it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth, <A name=C4V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yet when it is 
sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great 
branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof. <A 
name=C4V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And with many such parables spake he 
the word unto them, as they were able to hear it; <A name=C4V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and without a 
parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded 
all things. <A name=C4V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on that day, when even was come, he 
saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side. <A name=C4V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And leaving the 
multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats 
were with him. <A name=C4V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there ariseth a great storm of 
wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling. 
<A name=C4V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he himself was in the stern, asleep 
on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not 
that we perish? <A name=C4V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and 
said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great 
calm. <A name=C4V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Why are ye 
fearful? have ye not yet faith? <A name=C4V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they feared exceedingly, and said 
one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? 
<P>
<P>
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came to the other side of the 
sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was come out of the boat, 
straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, <A 
name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who 
had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with 
a chain; <A name=C5V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because that he had been often bound 
with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the 
fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him. <A 
name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and 
cutting himself with stones. <A name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran 
and worshipped him; <A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and crying out with a loud voice, he 
saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I 
adjure thee by God, torment me not. <A name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he said unto him, Come forth, thou 
unclean spirit, out of the man. <A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he asked him, What is thy name? And 
he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many. <A name=C5V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he besought him 
much that he would not send them away out of the country. <A name=C5V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now there was there 
on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding. <A name=C5V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they besought 
him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. <A 
name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he gave them leave. And the unclean 
spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep 
into the sea, <I>in number</I> about two thousand; and they were drowned in the 
sea. <A name=C5V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that fed them fled, and told 
it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had 
come to pass. <A name=C5V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they come to Jesus, and behold him 
that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, 
<I>even</I> him that had the legion: and they were afraid. <A name=C5V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that saw 
it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and 
concerning the swine. <A name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they began to beseech him to depart 
from their borders. <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he was entering into the boat, 
he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. 
<A name=C5V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he suffered him not, but saith unto 
him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord 
hath done for thee, and <I>how</I> he had mercy on thee. <A name=C5V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went his 
way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: 
and all men marvelled. <A name=C5V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus had crossed over again 
in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he 
was by the sea. <A name=C5V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there cometh one of the rulers of 
the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet, <A 
name=C5V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and beseecheth him much, saying, My 
little daughter is at the point of death: <I>I pray thee</I>, that thou come and 
lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live. <A name=C5V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went with 
him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him. <A 
name=C5V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a woman, who had an issue of blood 
twelve years, <A name=C5V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and had suffered many things of many 
physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather 
grew worse, <A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>having heard the things concerning 
Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. <A name=C5V28><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For she said, If I 
touch but his garments, I shall be made whole. <A name=C5V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the 
fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed 
of her plague. <A name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway Jesus, perceiving in 
himself that the power <I>proceeding</I> from him had gone forth, turned him 
about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? <A name=C5V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his disciples 
said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who 
touched me? <A name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he looked round about to see her 
that had done this thing. <A name=C5V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the woman fearing and trembling, 
knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him 
all the truth. <A name=C5V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy 
faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. <A 
name=C5V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While he yet spake, they come from the 
ruler of the synagogue's <I>house</I> saying, Thy daughter is dead: why 
troublest thou the Teacher any further? <A name=C5V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe. <A 
name=C5V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he suffered no man to follow with 
him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. <A name=C5V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they come to 
the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and 
<I>many</I> weeping and wailing greatly. <A name=C5V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was entered in, he saith 
unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth. 
<A name=C5V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they laughed him to scorn. But he, 
having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and 
them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was. <A name=C5V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And taking the 
child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, 
Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise. <A name=C5V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the damsel rose up, and 
walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a 
great amazement. <A name=C5V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he charged them much that no man 
should know this: and he commanded that <I>something</I> should be given her to 
eat. 
<P>
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went out from thence; and he 
cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him. <A name=C6V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the sabbath 
was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were 
astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom 
that is given unto this man, and <I>what mean</I> such mighty works wrought by 
his hands? <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Is not this the carpenter, the son of 
Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his 
sisters here with us? And they were offended in him. <A name=C6V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto 
them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own 
kin, and in his own house. <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he could there do no mighty work, 
save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. <A 
name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages 
teaching. <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he calleth unto him the twelve, and 
began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the 
unclean spirits; <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and he charged them that they should 
take nothing for <I>their</I> journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, 
now money in their purse; <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but <I>to go</I> shod with sandals: and, 
<I>said he</I>, put not on two coats. <A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye 
enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence. <A name=C6V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And whatsoever 
place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake 
off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them. <A 
name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went out, and preached that 
<I>men</I> should repent. <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they cast out many demons, and 
anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. <A name=C6V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And king Herod 
heard <I>thereof</I>; for his name had become known: and he said, John the 
Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him. <A 
name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But others said, It is Elijah. And 
others said, <I>It is</I> a prophet, <I>even</I> as one of the prophets. <A 
name=C6V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Herod, when he heard 
<I>thereof</I>, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen. <A name=C6V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Herod himself 
had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of 
Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her. <A name=C6V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For John said unto 
Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. <A name=C6V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Herodias set 
herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; <A 
name=C6V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for Herod feared John, knowing that he 
was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was 
much perplexed; and he heard him gladly. <A name=C6V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when a convenient day was come, 
that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, 
and the chief men of Galilee; <A name=C6V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and when the daughter of Herodias 
herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with 
him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I 
will give it thee. <A name=C6V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou 
shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. <A 
name=C6V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she went out, and said unto her 
mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer. <A 
name=C6V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she came in straightway with haste 
unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a 
platter the head of John the Baptist. <A name=C6V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the king was exceeding sorry; but 
for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject 
her. <A name=C6V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the king sent forth a 
soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded 
him in the prison, <A name=C6V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and brought his head on a platter, and 
gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother. <A name=C6V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when his 
disciples heard <I>thereof</I>, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in 
a tomb. <A name=C6V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the apostles gather themselves 
together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and 
whatsoever they had taught. <A name=C6V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, Come ye 
yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many 
coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. <A name=C6V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went away 
in the boat to a desert place apart. <A name=C6V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And <I>the people</I> saw them going, 
and many knew <I>them</I>, and they ran together there on foot from all the 
cities, and outwent them. <A name=C6V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he came forth and saw a great 
multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having 
a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. <A name=C6V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the day 
was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, 
and the day is now far spent; <A name=C6V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>send them away, that they may go into 
the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat. <A 
name=C6V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he answered and said unto them, 
Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred 
shillings' worth of bread, and give them to eat? <A name=C6V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto 
them, How many loaves have ye? go <I>and</I> see. And when they knew, they say, 
Five, and two fishes. <A name=C6V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he commanded them that all should 
sit down by companies upon the green grass. <A name=C6V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they sat down 
in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. <A name=C6V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took the five loaves and the two 
fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave 
to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them 
all. <A name=C6V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they all ate, and were filled. <A 
name=C6V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they took up broken pieces, twelve 
basketfuls, and also of the fishes. <A name=C6V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that ate the loaves were five 
thousand men. <A name=C6V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway he constrained his 
disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before <I>him</I> unto the other 
side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away. <A 
name=C6V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after he had taken leave of them, 
he departed into the mountain to pray. <A name=C6V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when even was come, the boat was in 
the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. <A name=C6V48><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And seeing them 
distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth 
watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have 
passed by them: <A name=C6V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but they, when they saw him walking on 
the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; <A name=C6V50><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they all saw 
him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, 
Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. <A name=C6V51><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went up unto 
them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in 
themselves; <A name=C6V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they understood not concerning the 
loaves, but their heart was hardened. <A name=C6V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had crossed over, they 
came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. <A name=C6V54><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they were 
come out of the boat, straightway <I>the people</I> knew him, <A 
name=C6V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and ran round about that whole region, 
and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he 
was. <A name=C6V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And wheresoever he entered, into 
villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the 
marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border 
of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. 
<P>
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there are gathered together unto him 
the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem, <A 
name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and 
had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, 
unwashen, hands. <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, 
except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the 
elders; <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and <I>when they come</I> from the 
market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things 
there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and 
brasen vessels.) <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Pharisees and the scribes ask 
him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but 
eat their bread with defiled hands? <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah 
prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;This people honoreth me with their lips, 
<P>&nbsp;But their heart is far from me. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;Teaching <I>as their</I> doctrines the precepts of men. 
<P><A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye leave the commandment of God, and 
hold fast the tradition of men. <A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Full well do ye 
reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. <A 
name=C7V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Moses said, Honor thy father and 
thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the 
death: <A name=C7V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but ye say, If a man shall say to his 
father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is 
Corban, that is to say, Given <I>to God</I>; <A name=C7V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>ye no longer suffer 
him to do aught for his father or his mother; <A name=C7V13><FONT

word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like 
things ye do. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called to him the multitude 
again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand: <A 
name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>there is nothing from without the man, 
that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man 
are those that defile the man. <A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>If any man hath ears to hear, let 
him hear.</I> <A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was entered into the house 
from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable. <A name=C7V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto 
them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever 
from without goeth into the man, <I>it</I> cannot defile him; <A 
name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because it goeth not into his heart, 
but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? <I>This he said</I>, making 
all meats clean. <A name=C7V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, That which proceedeth out 
of the man, that defileth the man. <A name=C7V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For from within, out of the heart of 
men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, <A 
name=C7V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>covetings, wickednesses, deceit, 
lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness: <A name=C7V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>all these evil 
things proceed from within, and defile the man. <A name=C7V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And from thence he 
arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a 
house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid. <A 
name=C7V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But straightway a woman, whose little 
daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his 
feet. <A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the woman was a Greek, a 
Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon 
out of her daughter. <A name=C7V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto her, Let the children 
first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to 
the dogs. <A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But she answered and saith unto him, 
Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. <A 
name=C7V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto her, For this saying 
go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter. <A name=C7V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And she went away 
unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out. 
<A name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again he went out from the borders 
of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of 
the borders of Decapolis. <A name=C7V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they bring unto him one that was 
deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand 
upon him. <A name=C7V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took him aside from the 
multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched 
his tongue; <A name=C7V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and looking up to heaven, he sighed, 
and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. <A name=C7V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And his ears were 
opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. <A 
name=C7V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he charged them that they should 
tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they 
published it. <A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were beyond measure 
astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to 
hear, and the dumb to speak. 
<P>
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: <A

if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some 
of them are come from far. <A name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? <A

he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. <A name=C8V6><FONT

the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and 
having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; 
and they set them before the multitude. <A name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. <A

they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained 
over, seven baskets. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he sent them away. <A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. <A

size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the Pharisees came forth, and began 
to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him. <A

size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and 
saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall 
no sign be given unto this generation. <A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

into <I>the boat</I> departed to the other side. <A name=C8V14><FONT

take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf. <A

beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. <A

saying, We have no bread. <A name=C8V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither 
understand? have ye your heart hardened? <A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having eyes, see ye not? and having 
ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? <A name=C8V19><FONT

five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took 
ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. <A name=C8V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, Seven. <A name=C8V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

understand? <A name=C8V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they come unto Bethsaida. And they 
bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. <A name=C8V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took hold of 
the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had 
spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught? 
<A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he looked up, and said, I see men; 
for I behold <I>them</I> as trees, walking. <A name=C8V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then again he laid 
his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all 
things clearly. <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saying, Do not even enter into the village. <A name=C8V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus went 
forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way 
he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am? <A 
name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they told him, saying, John the 
Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets. <A 
name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he asked them, But who say ye that 
I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. <A 
name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he charged them that they should 
tell no man of him. <A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he began to teach them, that the 
Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief 
priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. <A 
name=C8V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he spake the saying openly. And 
Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <A name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he turning about, and seeing his 
disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest 
not the things of God, but the things of men. <A name=C8V34><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he called unto 
him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come 
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <A 
name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever would save his life shall 
lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's shall 
save it. <A name=C8V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what doth it profit a man, to gain 
the whole world, and forfeit his life? <A name=C8V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what should a man give in exchange 
for his life? <A name=C8V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me 
and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also 
shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy 
angels.

you, There are some here of them that stand <I>by</I>, who shall in no wise 
taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power. <A 
name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And 
after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth 
them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before 
them; <A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and his garments became glistering, 
exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. <A name=C9V4><FONT

unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. <A

Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let 
us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
<A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

became sore afraid. <A name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear ye 
him. <A name=C9V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And suddenly looking round about, they 
saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves. <A name=C9V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they were 
coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what 
things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the 
dead. <A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they kept the saying, questioning 
among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean. <A 
name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they asked him, saying, <I>How is 
it</I> that the scribes say that Elijah must first come? <A name=C9V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it 
written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at 
nought? <A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say unto you, that Elijah is 
come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is 
written of him. <A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they came to the disciples, 
they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them. <A

size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway all the multitude, when 
they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. <A

with them? <A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one of the multitude answered him, 
Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit; <A name=C9V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and wheresoever it 
taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and 
pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they 
were not able. <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he answereth them and saith, O 
faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with 
you? bring him unto me. <A name=C9V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they brought him unto him: and when 
he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the 
ground, and wallowed foaming. <A name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he asked his father, How long time 
is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child. <A 
name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And oft-times it hath cast him both 
into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do 
anything, have compassion on us, and help us. <A name=C9V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto 
him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth. <A 
name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Straightway the father of the child 
cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. <A name=C9V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when Jesus saw 
that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying 
unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter 
no more into him. <A name=C9V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And having cried out, and torn him 
much, he came out: and <I>the boy</I> became as one dead; insomuch that the more 
part said, He is dead. <A name=C9V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus took him by the hand, and 
raised him up; and he arose. <A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was come into the house, 
his disciples asked him privately, <I>How is it</I> that we could not cast it 
out? <A name=C9V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, This kind can 
come out by nothing, save by prayer. <A name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went forth from thence, and 
passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. <A 
name=C9V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he taught his disciples, and said 
unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall 
kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again. <A 
name=C9V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they understood not the saying, and 
were afraid to ask him. <A name=C9V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they came to Capernaum: and when he 
was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way? <A 
name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they held their peace: for they had 
disputed one with another on the way, who <I>was</I> the greatest. <A 
name=C9V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sat down, and called the twelve; 
and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and 
servant of all. <A name=C9V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took a little child, and set him 
in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them, <A 
name=C9V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whosoever shall receive one of such 
little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth 
not me, but him that sent me. <A name=C9V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one 
casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us. 
<A name=C9V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for 
there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to 
speak evil of me. <A name=C9V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he that is not against us is for 
us. <A name=C9V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

water to drink, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you, he shall in no 
wise lose his reward. <A name=C9V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And whosoever shall cause one of these 
little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great 
millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. <A 
name=C9V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, 
cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having 
thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. <A name=C9V44><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>where their worm 
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</I> <A name=C9V45><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if thy foot 
cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, 
rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell. <A name=C9V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>where their worm 
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</I> <A name=C9V47><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if thine eye 
cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the 
kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell; 
<A name=C9V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>where their worm dieth not, and the 
fire is not quenched. <A name=C9V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

fire. <A name=C9V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at

What did Moses command you? <A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

have left all, and have followed thee. <A name=C10V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or 
father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel's sake, <A 
name=C10V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that 
followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the 
things that were to happen unto him, <A name=C10V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the

Gentiles: <A name=C10V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days 
he shall rise again. <A name=C10V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou 
shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee. <A name=C10V36><FONT

him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on <I>thy</I> 
left hand, in thy glory. <A name=C10V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with 
the baptism that I am baptized with? <A name=C10V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the 
baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: <A name=C10V40><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but to sit on my 
right hand or on <I>my</I> left hand is not mine to give; but <I>it is for 
them</I> for whom it hath been prepared. <A name=C10V41><FONT

heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John. <A 
name=C10V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus called them to him, and 
saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles 
lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them. <A 
name=C10V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister; <A

you, shall be servant of all. <A name=C10V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of 
Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side. <A

the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy 
on me. <A name=C10V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have 
mercy on me. <A name=C10V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus stood still, and said, Call 
ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he 
calleth thee. <A name=C10V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he, casting away his garment, 
sprang up, and came to Jesus. <A name=C10V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, 
that I may receive my sight. <A name=C10V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and 
followed him in the way.

the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye

<A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? <A name=C11V6><FONT

the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now 
eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. <A name=C11V12><FONT

when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered. <A name=C11V13><FONT

tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: 
and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season 
of figs. <A name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it. <A

entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that 
bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the 
seats of them that sold the doves; <A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

should carry a vessel through the temple. <A name=C11V17><FONT

said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer 
for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers. <A name=C11V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief 
priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for 
they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. <A

the city. <A name=C11V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. <A name=C11V21><FONT

is withered away. <A name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Have faith in God. <A name=C11V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

shall have it. <A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them. <A name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in 
heaven may forgive you your trespasses. <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the 
scribes, and the elders; <A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

things? <A name=C11V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

these things. <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe 
him? <A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit 
for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went 
into another country. <A name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the vineyard. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

sent him away empty. <A name=C12V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully. <A

killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some. <A name=C12V6><FONT

beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. <A

themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall 
be ours. <A name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

cast him forth out of the vineyard. <A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

unto others. <A name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>&nbsp;The stone which the builders rejected, 
<P>&nbsp;The same was made the head of the corner; 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C12V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable 
against them: and they left him, and went away. <A name=C12V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they send unto

him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou 
regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it 
lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? <A name=C12V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Shall we give, or

said unto him, Caesar's. <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. And 
they marvelled greatly at him. <A name=C12V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

man's brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his 
brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. <A

she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. <A name=C12V24><FONT

them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor 
the power of God? <A name=C12V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

heaven. <A name=C12V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

are raised; have ye not read in the book of Moses, in <I>the place 
concerning</I> the Bush, how God spake unto him, saying, I <I>am</I> the God of 
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? <A name=C12V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He is not the God 
of the dead, but of the living: ye do greatly err. <A name=C12V28><FONT

scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had 
answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all? <A

size=-1><SUP>12:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O 
Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one: <A name=C12V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all 
thy mind, and with all thy strength. <A name=C12V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The second is this, Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. <A 
name=C12V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the scribe said unto him, Of a 
truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but 
he: <A name=C12V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and to love him with all the heart, 
and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his 
neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices. 
<A name=C12V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no 
man after that durst ask him any question. <A name=C12V35><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answered 
and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the 
son of David? <A name=C12V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and <I>to have</I> salutations in 
the marketplaces, <A name=C12V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation. <A

treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many 
that were rich cast in much. <A name=C12V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

cast in two mites, which make a farthing. <A name=C12V43><FONT

him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow 
cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury: <A

her living.

one of his disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and 
what manner of buildings! <A name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said unto him, Seest thou 
these great buildings? there shall not be left here one stone upon another, 
which shall not be thrown down. <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as he sat on the mount of Olives 
over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him 
privately, <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Tell us, when shall these things be? 
and what <I>shall be</I> the sign when these things are all about to be 
accomplished? <A name=C13V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus began to say unto them, Take 
heed that no man lead you astray. <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many shall come in my name, saying, I 
am <I>he</I>; and shall lead many astray. <A name=C13V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when ye shall 
hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled: <I>these things</I> must needs 
come to pass; but the end is not yet. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For nation shall rise against nation, 
and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in divers places; there 
shall be famines: these things are the beginning of travail. <A name=C13V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But take ye heed to 
yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues shall 
ye be beaten; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a 
testimony unto them. <A name=C13V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the gospel must first be preached 
unto all the nations. <A name=C13V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they lead you <I>to 
judgment</I>, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: 
but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye 
that speak, but the Holy Spirit. <A name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And brother shall deliver up brother 
to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, 
and cause them to be put to death. <A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And ye shall be hated of all men for 
my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. <A 
name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when ye see the abomination of 
desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then 
let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains: <A name=C13V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and let him that 
is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out his house: <A 
name=C13V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and let him that is in the field not 
return back to take his cloak. <A name=C13V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But woe unto them that are with child 
and to them that give suck in those days! <A name=C13V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And pray ye that 
it be not in the winter. <A name=C13V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For those days shall be tribulation, 
such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which 
God created until now, and never shall be. <A name=C13V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And except the 
Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect's 
sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days. <A name=C13V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And then if any 
man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there; believe <I>it</I> 
not: <A name=C13V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for there shall arise false Christs 
and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, 
if possible, the elect. <A name=C13V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But take ye heed: behold, I have told 
you all things beforehand. <A name=C13V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But in those days, after that 
tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 
<A name=C13V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and the stars shall be falling from 
heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken. <A 
name=C13V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And then shall they see the Son of man 
coming in clouds with great power and glory. <A name=C13V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And then shall he 
send forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, 
from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. <A 
name=C13V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now from the fig tree learn her 
parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye 
know that the summer is nigh; <A name=C13V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even so ye also, when ye see these 
things coming to pass, know ye that he is nigh, <I>even</I> at the doors. <A 
name=C13V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto you, This generation 
shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. <A

my words shall not pass away. <A name=C13V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. <A 
name=C13V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

know not when the time is. <A name=C13V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>It is</I> as <I>when</I> a man, 
sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his 
servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch. <A 
name=C13V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Watch therefore: for ye know not when 
the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at 
cockcrowing, or in the morning; <A name=C13V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after two days was <I>the feast 
of</I> the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the 
scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him: <A 
name=C14V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for they said, Not during the feast, 
lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people. <A name=C14V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And while he was in 
Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman 
having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; <I>and</I> she 
brake the cruse, and poured it over his head. <A name=C14V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there were some 
that had indignation among themselves, <I>saying</I>, To what purpose hath this 
waste of the ointment been made? <A name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this ointment might have been sold 
for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor. And they murmured 
against her. <A name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said, Let her alone; why 
trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. <A name=C14V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For ye have the 
poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have 
not always. <A name=C14V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She hath done what she could; she hath 
anointed my body beforehand for the burying. <A name=C14V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And verily I say 
unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, 
that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. 
<A name=C14V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of 
the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto 
them. <A name=C14V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, when they heard it, were 
glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently 
deliver him <I>unto them</I>. <A name=C14V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And on the first day of unleavened 
bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say unto him, Where wilt 
thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover? <A 
name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he sendeth two of his disciples, 
and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a 
pitcher of water: follow him; <A name=C14V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and wheresoever he shall enter in, say 
to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where 
I shall eat the passover with my disciples? <A name=C14V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he will 
himself show you a large upper room furnished <I>and</I> ready: and there make 
ready for us. <A name=C14V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the disciples went forth, and came 
into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the 
passover. <A name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when it was evening he cometh with 
the twelve. <A name=C14V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they sat and were eating, Jesus 
said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, <I>even</I> he that 
eateth with me. <A name=C14V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They began to be sorrowful, and to say 
unto him one by one, Is it I? <A name=C14V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, <I>It is</I> 
one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish. <A name=C14V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Son of man 
goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son 
of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. <A 
name=C14V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as they were eating, he took 
bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take 
ye: this is my body. <A name=C14V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he took a cup, and when he had 
given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it. <A name=C14V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto 
them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. <A 
name=C14V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Verily I say unto you, I shall no more 
drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the 
kingdom of God. <A name=C14V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had sung a hymn, they 
went out unto the mount of Olives. <A name=C14V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus saith unto them, All ye 
shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep 
shall be scattered abroad. <A name=C14V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will 
go before you into Galilee. <A name=C14V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter said unto him, Although all 
shall be offended, yet will not I. <A name=C14V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say 
unto thee, that thou to-day, <I>even</I> this night, before the cock crow twice, 
shalt deny me thrice. <A name=C14V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he spake exceedingly vehemently, 
If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they 
all. <A name=C14V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they come unto a place which was 
named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray. <A 
name=C14V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he taketh with him Peter and James 
and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled. <A 
name=C14V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, My soul is 
exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch. <A 
name=C14V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he went forward a little, and fell 
on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away 
from him. <A name=C14V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said, Abba, Father, all things 
are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but 
what thou wilt. <A name=C14V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cometh, and findeth them 
sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch 
one hour? <A name=C14V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into 
temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. <A 
name=C14V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again he went away, and prayed, 
saying the same words. <A name=C14V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And again he came, and found them 
sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him. 
<A name=C14V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he cometh the third time, and 
saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is 
come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <A 
name=C14V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Arise, let us be going: behold, he 
that betrayeth me is at hand. <A name=C14V43><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway, while he yet spake, 
cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and 
staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. <A 
name=C14V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he that betrayed him had given 
them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead 
him away safely. <A name=C14V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he was come, straightway he 
came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him. <A name=C14V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they laid 
hands on him, and took him. <A name=C14V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But a certain one of them that stood 
by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his 
ear. <A name=C14V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me? <A 
name=C14V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:49</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I was daily with you in the temple 
teaching, and ye took me not: but <I>this is done</I> that the scriptures might 
be fulfilled. <A name=C14V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:50</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they all left him, and fled. <A 
name=C14V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And a certain young man followed with 
him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over <I>his</I> naked <I>body</I>: and 
they lay hold on him; <A name=C14V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he left the linen cloth, and fled 
naked. <A name=C14V53><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:53</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they led Jesus away to the high 
priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders 
and the scribes. <A name=C14V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Peter had followed him afar off, 
even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the 
officers, and warming himself in the light <I>of the fire</I>. <A 
name=C14V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests and the whole 
council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not. <A 
name=C14V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For many bare false witness against 
him, and their witness agreed not together. <A name=C14V57><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there stood up 
certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, <A name=C14V58><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We heard him say, 
I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will 
build another made without hands. <A name=C14V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And not even so did their witness 
agree together. <A name=C14V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the high priest stood up in the 
midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these 
witness against thee? <A name=C14V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he held his peace, and answered 
nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the 
Christ, the Son of the Blessed? <A name=C14V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see 
the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of 
heaven. <A name=C14V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the high priest rent his clothes, 
and saith, What further need have we of witnesses? <A name=C14V64><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Ye have heard the 
blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death. <A 
name=C14V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some began to spit on him, and to 
cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the 
officers received him with blows of their hands. <A name=C14V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And as Peter was 
beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest; <A 
name=C14V67><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and seeing Peter warming himself, she 
looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, <I>even</I> Jesus. 
<A name=C14V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:68</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he denied, saying, I neither know, 
nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock 
crew. <A name=C14V69><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:69</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the maid saw him, and began again 
to say to them that stood by, This is <I>one</I> of them. <A name=C14V70><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he again 
denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, of a 
truth thou art <I>one</I> of them; for thou art a Galilaean. <A 
name=C14V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he began to curse, and to swear, I 
know not this man of whom ye speak. <A name=C14V72><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:72</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway the second time the 
cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said unto him, 
Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought 
thereon, he wept. 
<P>
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And straightway in the morning the 
chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a 
consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to 
Pilate. <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King 
of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest. <A name=C15V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the chief 
priests accused him of many things. <A name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate again asked him, saying, 
Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of. <A 
name=C15V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus no more answered anything; 
insomuch that Pilate marvelled. <A name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now at the feast he used to release 
unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. <A name=C15V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there was one 
called Barabbas, <I>lying</I> bound with them that had made insurrection, men 
who in the insurrection had committed murder. <A name=C15V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the multitude 
went up and began to ask him <I>to do</I> as he was wont to do unto them. <A 
name=C15V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate answered them, saying, Will 
ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? <A name=C15V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he perceived 
that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <A name=C15V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the chief 
priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto 
them. <A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate again answered and said 
unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? <A 
name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
<A name=C15V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate said unto them, Why, what 
evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him. <A 
name=C15V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate, wishing to content the 
multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had 
scourged him, to be crucified. <A name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the soldiers led him away within 
the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. <A 
name=C15V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they clothe him with purple, and 
platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; <A name=C15V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they began to 
salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! <A name=C15V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they smote his head with a reed, 
and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. <A name=C15V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when they had 
mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And 
they lead him out to crucify him. <A name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they compel one passing by, Simon 
of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go 
<I>with them</I>, that he might bear his cross. <A name=C15V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they bring him 
unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. <A 
name=C15V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they offered him wine mingled with 
myrrh: but he received it not. <A name=C15V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they crucify him, and part his 
garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take. <A 
name=C15V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And it was the third hour, and they 
crucified him. <A name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the superscription of his 
accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <A name=C15V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And with him they 
crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. <A 
name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><I>And the scripture was fulfilled, 
which saith, And he was reckoned with transgressors.</I> <A name=C15V29><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they that 
passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that 
destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, <A name=C15V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>save thyself, and 
come down from the cross. <A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In like manner also the chief priests 
mocking <I>him</I> among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; 
himself he cannot save. <A name=C15V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, 
now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were 
crucified with him reproached him. <A name=C15V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the sixth hour was come, 
there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. <A 
name=C15V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with 
a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, 
my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <A name=C15V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And some of them that stood by, when 
they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah. <A name=C15V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And one ran, and 
filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, 
saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down. <A 
name=C15V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and 
gave up the ghost. <A name=C15V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the veil of the temple was rent in 
two from the top to the bottom. <A name=C15V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the centurion, who stood by 
over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was 
the Son of God. <A name=C15V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And there were also women beholding 
from afar: among whom <I>were</I> both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of 
James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <A name=C15V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, when he was 
in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that 
came up with him unto Jerusalem. <A name=C15V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when even was now come, because it 
was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, <A name=C15V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>there came Joseph 
of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking 
for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the 
body of Jesus. <A name=C15V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Pilate marvelled if he were 
already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had 
been any while dead. <A name=C15V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when he learned it of the 
centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph. <A name=C15V46><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:46</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he bought a 
linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in 
a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door 
of the tomb. <A name=C15V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:47</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the 
<I>mother</I> of Joses beheld where he was laid. 
<P>
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And when the sabbath was past, Mary 
Magdalene, and Mary the <I>mother</I> of James, and Salome, bought spices, that 
they might come and anoint him. <A name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And very early on the first day of the 
week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen. <A name=C16V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they were 
saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the 
tomb? <A name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and looking up, they see that the stone 
is rolled back: for it was exceeding great. <A name=C16V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And entering into 
the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white 
robe; and they were amazed. <A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: 
ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not 
here: behold, the place where they laid him! <A name=C16V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But go, tell his 
disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, 
as he said unto you. <A name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went out, and fled from the 
tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing 
to any one; for they were afraid. <A name=C16V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when he was risen early on the 
first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had 
cast out seven demons. <A name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She went and told them that had been 
with him, as they mourned and wept. <A name=C16V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they, when they heard that he was 
alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved. <A name=C16V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And after these 
things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on 
their way into the country. <A name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went away and told it unto 
the rest: neither believed they them. <A name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And afterward he was manifested unto 
the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their 
unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him 
after he was risen. <A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And he said unto them, Go ye into all 
the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation. <A name=C16V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He that believeth 
and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. <A 
name=C16V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And these signs shall accompany them 
that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new 
tongues; <A name=C16V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>they shall take up serpents, and if 
they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands 
on the sick, and they shall recover. <A name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had 
spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of 
God. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And they went forth, and preached 
everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs 
that followed. Amen.
