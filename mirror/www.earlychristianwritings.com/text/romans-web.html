<H1>Paul’s Letter to the Romans </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called 
to be an apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God, <A name=C1V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>which he promised 
before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, <A name=C1V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>concerning his Son, 
who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, <A name=C1V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who was declared to 
be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the 
resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, <A name=C1V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>through whom we 
received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, 
for his name's sake; <A name=C1V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>among whom you are also called to belong 
to Jesus Christ; <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, 
called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 
<P><A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>First, I thank my God through Jesus 
Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. 
<A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For God is my witness, whom I serve in 
my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always 
in my prayers, <A name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>requesting, if by any means now at last 
I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you. <A name=C1V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I long to see 
you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be 
established; <A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that is, that I with you may be 
encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine. 
<P><A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I don't desire to have you unaware, 
brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I 
might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles. <A 
name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish. 
<A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So, as much as is in me, I am eager to 
preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome. <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for 
everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek. <A 
name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For in it is revealed God's 
righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, "But the righteous shall 
live by faith." <A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the wrath of God is revealed from 
heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the 
truth in unrighteousness, <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because that which is known of God is 
revealed in them, for God revealed it to them. <A name=C1V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the invisible 
things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived 
through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that 
they may be without excuse. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Because, knowing God, they didn't 
glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and 
their senseless heart was darkened. 
<P><A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Professing themselves to be wise, they 
became fools, <A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and traded the glory of the 
incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, 
and four-footed animals, and creeping things. <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore God also 
gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies 
should be dishonored among themselves, <A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who exchanged the truth of God for a 
lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is 
blessed forever. Amen. 
<P><A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this reason, God gave them up to 
vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is 
against nature. <A name=C1V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Likewise also the men, leaving the 
natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men 
doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due 
penalty of their error. <A name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even as they refused to have God in 
their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which 
are not fitting; <A name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>being filled with all unrighteousness, 
sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, 
murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers, <A name=C1V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>backbiters, hateful 
to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to 
parents, <A name=C1V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>without understanding, 
covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful; <A 
name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who, knowing the ordinance of God, that 
those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but 
also approve of those who practice them. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, 
whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn 
yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We know that the 
judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. <A 
name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do 
you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the 
same, that you will escape the judgment of God? <A name=C2V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or do you despise 
the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the 
goodness of God leads you to repentance? <A name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But according to your hardness and 
unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, 
revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God; <A name=C2V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who "will pay back 
to everyone according to their works:" <A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to those who by patience in well-doing 
seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, eternal life; <A name=C2V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but to those who are 
self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath 
and indignation, <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>oppression and anguish, on every soul of 
man who works evil, on the Jew first, and also on the Greek. 
<P><A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But glory and honor and peace to every 
man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there is no 
partiality with God. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as many as have sinned without law 
will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be 
judged by the law. <A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it isn't the hearers of the law who 
are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified <A 
name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>(for when Gentiles who don't have the 
law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to 
themselves, <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in that they show the work of the law 
written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their 
thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them) <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in the day when God 
will judge the secrets of men, according to my Gospel, by Jesus Christ. 
<P><A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and 
rest on the law, and glory in God, <A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and know his will, and approve the 
things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, <A name=C2V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and are confident 
that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in 
darkness, <A name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher 
of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. <A 
name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You therefore who teach another, don't 
you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal? <A 
name=C2V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You who say a man shouldn't commit 
adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <A 
name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You who glory in the law, through your 
disobedience of the law do you dishonor God? <A name=C2V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For "the name of 
God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written. <A 
name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For circumcision indeed profits, if you 
are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your 
circumcision has become uncircumcision. <A name=C2V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the 
ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? <A 
name=C2V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Won't the uncircumcision which is by 
nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision 
are a transgressor of the law? <A name=C2V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he is not a Jew who is one 
outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; <A 
name=C2V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, 
and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose 
praise is not from men, but from God. 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then what advantage does the Jew have? 
Or what is the profit of circumcision? <A name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Much in every way! Because first of all, 
they were entrusted with the oracles of God. <A name=C3V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what if some 
were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God? <A 
name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>May 
it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, 

<P>&nbsp;"That you might be justified in your 
words,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And might prevail when you come 
into judgment." 
<P><A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if our unrighteousness commends the 
righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I 
speak like men do. <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>May it never be! For then how will God 
judge the world? <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the truth of God through my lie 
abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? <A 
name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why 
not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us 
do evil, that good may come?" Those who say so are justly condemned. <A 
name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What 
then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously charged both 
Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin. <A name=C3V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"There is no one righteous.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, 
not one. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There is no one who 
understands.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one who seeks 
after God. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They have all turned 
aside.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have together become 
unprofitable. 
<P>&nbsp;There is no one who does 
good,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not, so much as one." 
<P>

law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be 
closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God. <A 
name=C3V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of 
sin. <A name=C3V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now apart from the law, a 
righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the 
prophets; <A name=C3V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even the righteousness of God through 
faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no

the glory of God; <A name=C3V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; <A name=C3V25><FONT

to be <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N1">an atoning

righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance; <A

<P><A name=C3V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. <A 
name=C3V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We 
maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the 
law. <A name=C3V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, <A name=C3V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>since indeed there 
is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised 
through faith. <A name=C3V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do we then nullify the law through 
faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law. 
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What then will we say that Abraham, our 
forefather, has found according to the flesh? <A name=C4V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if Abraham was 
justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God. <A 
name=C4V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For 
what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him 
for righteousness." <A name=C4V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now to him who works, the reward is not 
counted as grace, but as debt. <A name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to him who doesn't work, but 
believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for 
righteousness. <A name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even as David also pronounces blessing 
on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Blessed are they whose iniquities are

<P>&nbsp;<A name=C4V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

no means charge with sin." 
<P><A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Is this blessing then pronounced on the 
circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted 
to Abraham for righteousness. <A name=C4V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How then was it counted? When he was in 
circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
<A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He received the sign of circumcision, a 
seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in 
uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though 
they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them. 
<A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The father of circumcision to those who 
not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith 
of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision. <A name=C4V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the promise to 
Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the 
law, but through the righteousness of faith. <A name=C4V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if those who 
are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no 
effect. <A name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the law works wrath, for where 
there is no law, neither is there disobedience. <A name=C4V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause it 
is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may 
be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also 
which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. <A 
name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations." This is in the 
presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the 
things that are not, as though they were. <A name=C4V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who in hope 
believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, 
according to that which had been spoken, "So will your seed be." <A 
name=C4V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Without being weakened in faith, he 
didn't consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a 
hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb. <A name=C4V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yet, looking to the 
promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, 
giving glory to God, <A name=C4V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and being fully assured that what he 
had promised, he was able also to perform. <A name=C4V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore it also 
was "reckoned to him for righteousness." <A name=C4V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now it was not written that it was 
accounted to him for his sake alone, <A name=C4V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but for our sake also, to whom it will 
be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead, <A 
name=C4V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who was delivered up for our 
trespasses, and was raised for our justification. 
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being therefore justified by faith, we 
have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; <A name=C5V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>through whom we also 
have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope 
of the glory of God. <A name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not only this, but we also rejoice in 
our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance; <A name=C5V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and perseverance, 
proven character; and proven character, hope: <A name=C5V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and hope doesn't 
disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through 
the Holy Spirit who was given to us. <A name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For while we were yet weak, at the right 
time Christ died for the ungodly. <A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For one will hardly die for a righteous 
man. Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die. <A 
name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ 
died for us. 
<P><A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Much more then, being now justified by 
his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him. <A name=C5V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if, while we 
were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, 
being reconciled, we will be saved by his life. 
<P><A name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not only so, but we also rejoice in God 
through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the 
reconciliation. <A name=C5V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, as sin entered into the 
world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, 
because all sinned. <A name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For until the law, sin was in the 
world; but sin is not charged when there is no law. <A name=C5V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nevertheless death 
reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's 
disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come. <A name=C5V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the free gift 
isn't like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much 
more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus 
Christ, abound to the many. <A name=C5V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The gift is not as through one who 
sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of 
many trespasses to justification. <A name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if by the trespass of the one, 
death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance 
of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus 
Christ. <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then as through one trespass, all 
men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were 
justified to life. <A name=C5V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as through the one man's 
disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one 
will many be made righteous. <A name=C5V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The law came in besides, that the 
trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more 
exceedingly; <A name=C5V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that as sin reigned in death, even so 
might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our 
Lord. 
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What shall we say then? Shall we 
continue in sin, that grace may abound? <A name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>May it never be! We who died to sin, how 
could we live in it any longer? <A name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or don't you know that all we who were 
baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <A name=C6V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We were buried 
therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised 
from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness 
of life. <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if we have become united with him in 
the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection; <A 
name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>knowing this, that our old man was 
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we 
would no longer be in bondage to sin. <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he who has died has been freed from 
sin. <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if we died with Christ, we believe 
that we will also live with him; <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>knowing that Christ, being raised from 
the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him! <A name=C6V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the death that 
he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God. 
<A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Thus also consider yourselves also to 
be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
<P><A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore don't let sin reign in your 
mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. <A name=C6V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither present 
your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to 
God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to 
God. <A name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For sin will not have dominion over 
you. For you are not under law, but under grace. <A name=C6V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What then? Shall we 
sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be! <A 
name=C6V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't you know that to whom you present 
yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether 
of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? <A name=C6V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But thanks be to 
God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the 
heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered. <A name=C6V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being made free 
from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness. 
<P><A name=C6V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I speak in human terms because of the 
weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to 
uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members 
as servants to righteousness for sanctification. <A name=C6V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For when you were 
servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. <A name=C6V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What fruit then did 
you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of 
those things is death. <A name=C6V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now, being made free from sin, and 
having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the 
result of eternal life. <A name=C6V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the wages of sin is death, but the 
free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or don't you know, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N2">brothers</A> (for I speak 
to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he 
lives? <A name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the woman that has a husband is 
bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is 
discharged from the law of the husband. <A name=C7V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then if, while the husband lives, she 
is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband 
dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is 
joined to another man. <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, my brothers, you also were 
made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to 
another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to 
God. <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For when we were in the flesh, the 
sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth 
fruit to death. <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now we have been discharged from the 
law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of 
the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter. 
<P><A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? 
May it never be! However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law. For 
I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said, "You shall not covet." 
<A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But sin, finding occasion through the 
commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin 
is dead. <A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I was alive apart from the law once, but 
when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. <A name=C7V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The commandment, 
which was for life, this I found to be for death; <A name=C7V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for sin, finding 
occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me. <A 
name=C7V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore the law indeed is holy, and 
the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. 
<P><A name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Did then that which is good become 
death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by 
working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin 
might become exceeding sinful. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we know that the law is spiritual, 
but I am fleshly, sold under sin. <A name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I don't know what I am doing. For I 
don't practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do. <A 
name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if what I don't desire, that I do, 
I consent to the law that it is good. <A name=C7V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So now it is no more I that do it, but 
sin which dwells in me. <A name=C7V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I know that in me, that is, in my 
flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don't find it 
doing that which is good. <A name=C7V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the good which I desire, I don't 
do; but the evil which I don't desire, that I practice. <A name=C7V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if what I don't 
desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me. <A

find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present. <A 
name=C7V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I delight in God's law after the 
inward man, <A name=C7V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but I see a different law in my 
members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity 
under the law of sin which is in my members. <A name=C7V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What a wretched man 
I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death? <A name=C7V25><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I thank God through 
Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but 
with the flesh, the sin's law. 
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There is therefore now no condemnation 
to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't walk according to the flesh, but 
according to the Spirit. <A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the law of the Spirit of life in 
Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death. <A name=C8V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what the law 
couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son 
in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh; <A 
name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that 
the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, 
but after the Spirit. <A name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For those who live according to the 
flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according 
to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. <A name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the mind of the flesh is death, but 
the mind of the Spirit is life and peace; <A name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>because the mind of the flesh is hostile 
towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be. <A 
name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Those who are in the flesh can't please 
God. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But you are not in the flesh but in the 
Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man doesn't 
have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his. <A name=C8V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If Christ is in 
you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of 
righteousness. <A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if the Spirit of him who raised up 
Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead 
will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. 
<A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not 
to the flesh, to live after the flesh. <A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if you live after the flesh, you 
must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will 
live. <A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as many as are led by the Spirit of 
God, these are children of God. <A name=C8V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you didn't receive the spirit of 
bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, 
"<A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N3">Abba</A>! Father!" 
<P><A name=C8V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Spirit himself testifies with our 
spirit that we are children of God; <A name=C8V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and if children, then heirs; heirs of 
God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also 
be glorified with him. <A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I consider that the sufferings of 
this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be 
revealed toward us. <A name=C8V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the creation waits with eager 
expectation for the children of God to be revealed. <A name=C8V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the creation 
was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected 
it, in hope <A name=C8V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that the creation itself also will be 
delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the 
children of God. <A name=C8V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we know that the whole creation 
groans and travails in pain together until now. <A name=C8V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not only so, but 
ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan 
within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body. <A 
name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we were saved in hope, but hope 
that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees? <A 
name=C8V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if we hope for that which we don't 
see, we wait for it with patience. <A name=C8V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In the same way, the Spirit also helps 
our weaknesses, for we don't know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit 
himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered. <A 
name=C8V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes 
intercession for the saints according to God. 
<P><A name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We know that all things work together 
for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his 
purpose. <A name=C8V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For whom he foreknew, he also 
predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the 
firstborn among many <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N4">brothers.</A> <A 
name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Whom he predestined, those he also 
called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he 
also glorified. 
<P><A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What then shall we say about these 
things? If God is for us, who can be against us? <A name=C8V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He who didn't spare 
his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him 
freely give us all things? <A name=C8V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who could bring a charge against God's 
chosen ones? It is God who justifies. <A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who is he who condemns? It is Christ 
who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of 
God, who also makes intercession for us. 
<P><A name=C8V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who shall separate us from the love of 
Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, 
or peril, or sword? <A name=C8V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even as it is written, "For your sake 
we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter." <A 
name=C8V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>No, in all these things, we are more 
than conquerors through him who loved us. <A name=C8V38><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I am persuaded, 
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things 
present, nor things to come, nor powers, <A name=C8V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>nor height, nor depth, nor any other 
created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in 
Christ Jesus our Lord. 
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I tell the truth in Christ. I am not 
lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit, <A name=C9V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that I have great 
sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. <A name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I could wish that I myself were 
accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh, 
<A name=C9V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who are Israelites; whose is the 
adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the 
promises; <A name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>of whom are the fathers, and from whom 
is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen. 
<P><A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But it is not as though the word of God 
has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel. <A 
name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Neither, because they are Abraham's 
seed, are they all children. But, "In Isaac will your seed be called." <A 
name=C9V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That 
is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the 
children of the promise are counted as a seed. <A name=C9V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this is a word 
of promise, "At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son." <A 
name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived 
by one, by our father Isaac. <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For being not yet born, neither having 
done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might 
stand, not of works, but of him who calls, <A name=C9V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>it was said to her, 
"The elder will serve the younger." <A name=C9V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, 
but Esau I hated." 
<P><A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What shall we say then? Is there 
unrighteousness with God? May it never be! <A name=C9V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he said to 
Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on 
whom I have compassion." <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then it is not of him who wills, nor 
of him who runs, but of God who has mercy. <A name=C9V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Scripture 
says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I 
might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all 
the earth." <A name=C9V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then, he has mercy on whom he 
desires, and he hardens whom he desires. <A name=C9V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You will say then to me, "Why does he 
still find fault? For who withstands his will?" <A name=C9V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But indeed, O man, 
who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, 
"Why did you make me like this?" <A name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or hasn't the potter a right over the 
clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for 
dishonor? <A name=C9V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What if God, willing to show his wrath, 
and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made 
for destruction, <A name=C9V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and that he might make known the riches 
of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, <A 
name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>us, whom he also called, not from the 
Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? <A name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he says also in Hosea, 
<P>&nbsp;"I will call them 'my people,' which were not my 
people;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her 'beloved,' who was not 
beloved." 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C9V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"It will be that in the place where it 
was said to them, 'You are not my 
people,'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they will be called 
'children of the living God.'" 
<P><A name=C9V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Isaiah cries concerning Israel, 
<P>&nbsp;"If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the 
sea,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the remnant who will be saved; 

<P>&nbsp;<A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For He will finish the work and cut it 
short in righteousness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the LORD 
will make a short work upon the earth." 
<P><A name=C9V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As Isaiah has said before, 
<P>&nbsp;"Unless the Lord of <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N5">Hosts</A> had left us a 
seed,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have become like 
Sodom,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would have been made like 
Gomorrah." 
<P><A name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What shall we say then? That the 
Gentiles, who didn't follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even 
the righteousness which is of faith; <A name=C9V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but Israel, following after a law of 
righteousness, didn't arrive at the law of righteousness. <A name=C9V32><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why? Because they 
didn't seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over 
the stumbling stone; <A name=C9V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>even as it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of 
offense;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no one who believes in him 
will be disappointed." 
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Brothers, my heart's desire and my 
prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved. <A name=C10V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I testify about 
them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. <A 
name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For being ignorant of God's 
righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't 
subject themselves to the righteousness of God. <A name=C10V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Christ is the 
<A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N6">fulfillment</A> of the 
law for righteousness to everyone who believes. <A name=C10V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Moses writes 
about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them." 
<A name=C10V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the righteousness which is of faith 
says this, "Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to 
bring Christ down); <A name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' 
(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)" <A name=C10V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But what does it 
say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word 
of faith, which we preach: <A name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that if you will confess with your 
mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the 
dead, you will be saved. <A name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For with the heart, one believes unto 
righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <A 
name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Scripture says, "Whoever 
believes in him will not be disappointed." 
<P><A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For there is no distinction between 
Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on 
him. <A name=C10V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For, "Whoever will call on the name of 
the Lord will be saved." <A name=C10V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>How then will they call on him in whom 
they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? 
How will they hear without a preacher? <A name=C10V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And how will they preach unless they 
are sent? As it is written: 
<P>&nbsp;"How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Gospel of 
peace,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bring glad tidings of good 
things!" 
<P><A name=C10V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But they didn't all listen to the glad 
news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" <A name=C10V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So faith comes by 
hearing, and hearing by the word of God. <A name=C10V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I say, didn't 
they hear? Yes, most assuredly, 
<P>&nbsp;"Their sound went out into all the 
earth,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their words to the ends of the 
world." 
<P><A name=C10V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I ask, didn't Israel know? First 
Moses says, 
<P>&nbsp;"I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no 
nation,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a nation void of 
understanding I will make you angry." 
<P><A name=C10V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Isaiah is very bold, and says, 
<P>&nbsp;"I was found by those who didn't seek 
me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was revealed to those who didn't 
ask for me." 
<P><A name=C10V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as to Israel he says, "All day 
long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people." 
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I ask then, Did God reject his people? 
May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the 
tribe of Benjamin. <A name=C11V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>God didn't reject his people, which he 
foreknew. Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads 
with God against Israel: <A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Lord, they have killed your prophets, 
they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life." 
<A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But how does God answer him? "I have 
reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal." <A 
name=C11V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even so then at this present time also 
there is a remnant according to the election of grace. <A name=C11V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And if by grace, 
then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is 
of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. 
<P><A name=C11V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were 
hardened. <A name=C11V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>According as it is written, "God gave 
them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they 
should not hear, to this very day." <A name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>David says, 
<P>&nbsp;"Let their table be made a snare, and a 
trap,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stumbling block, and a 
retribution to them. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C11V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let their eyes be darkened, that they 
may not see.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow down their back always." 

<P><A name=C11V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I ask then, did they stumble that they 
might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the 
Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. <A name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now if their fall is the riches of the 
world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness? 
<A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. 
Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; <A 
name=C11V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>if by any means I may provoke to 
jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them. <A name=C11V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the 
rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance 
be, but life from the dead? <A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches. <A name=C11V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if some of the 
branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among 
them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive 
tree; <A name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>don't boast over the branches. But if 
you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you. <A

broken off, that I might be grafted in." <A name=C11V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>True; by their 
unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don't be conceited, 
but fear; <A name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for if God didn't spare the natural 
branches, neither will he spare you. <A name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>See then the goodness and severity of 
God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue 
in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off. <A name=C11V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They also, if they 
don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft 
them in again. <A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if you were cut out of that which 
is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good 
olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted 
into their own olive tree? <A name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I don't desire, <A

ignorant of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a

come in, <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

as it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"There will come out of Zion the

<P><A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

are irrevocable. <A name=C11V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

all.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=C11V33><FONT

judgments, and his ways past tracing out! 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C11V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C11V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen. 
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

God, which is your spiritual service. <A name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't be conformed to this world, but 
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the 
good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. <A name=C12V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I say, through 
the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of 
himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has 
apportioned to each person a measure of faith. <A name=C12V4><FONT

many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function, <A

we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of 
another. <A name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C12V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

with those who weep. <A name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Don't be wise in your own conceits. <A name=C12V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

what is honorable in the sight of all men. <A name=C12V18><FONT

as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men. <A name=C12V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't seek revenge 
yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, 
"Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord." <A name=C12V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore 
<P>&nbsp;"If your enemy is hungry, feed 
him.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is thirsty, give him a

<P><A name=C12V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

overcome evil with good. 
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let every soul be in subjection to the 
higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who 
exist are ordained by God. <A name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore he who resists the authority, 
withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to 
themselves judgment. <A name=C13V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For rulers are not a terror to the good 
work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that 
which is good, and you will have praise from the same, <A name=C13V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he is a servant 
of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he 
doesn't bear the sword in vain; for he is a minister of God, an avenger for 
wrath to him who does evil. <A name=C13V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore you need to be in subjection, 
not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake. <A 
name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this reason you also pay taxes, for 
they are ministers of God's service, attending continually on this very thing. 
<A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Give therefore to everyone what you 
owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom 
respect; honor to whom honor. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 
<P><A name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not 
give false testimony," "You shall not covet,"<FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP><A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N8">*</A></SUP></FONT></FONT> 
and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, 
namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." <A name=C13V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Love doesn't harm 
a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law. <A name=C13V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do this, knowing 
the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation 
is now nearer to us than when we first believed. <A name=C13V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The night is far 
gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and 
let's put on the armor of light. <A name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let us walk properly, as in the day; 
not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and 
not in strife and jealousy. <A name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts. 
<P><A name=C14V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now receive one who is weak in faith, 
but not for disputes over opinions. <A name=C14V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One man has faith to eat all things, 
but he who is weak eats only vegetables. <A name=C14V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't let him who eats despise him who 
doesn't eat. Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats, for God has 
received him. <A name=C14V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who are you who judge another's 
servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for 
God has power to make him stand. 
<P><A name=C14V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>One man esteems one day as more 
important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his 
own mind. <A name=C14V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He who observes the day, observes it to 
the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe 
it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn't eat, 
to the Lord he doesn't eat, and gives God thanks. <A name=C14V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For none of us 
lives to himself, and none dies to himself. <A name=C14V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if we live, we 
live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, 
we are the Lord's. <A name=C14V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For to this end Christ died, rose, and 
lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 
<P><A name=C14V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But you, why do you judge your 
brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand 
before the judgment seat of Christ. <A name=C14V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee will 
bow.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every tongue will confess to God.'" 
<P><A name=C14V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then each one of us will give 
account of himself to God. <A name=C14V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore let's not judge one another 
any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his 
brother's way, or an occasion for falling. <A name=C14V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know, and am 
persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to 
him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. <A 
name=C14V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yet if because of food your brother is 
grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don't destroy with your food him for whom 
Christ died. <A name=C14V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then don't let your good be slandered, 
<A name=C14V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for the Kingdom of God is not eating 
and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. <A 
name=C14V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he who serves Christ in these 
things is acceptable to God and approved by men. <A name=C14V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then, let us 
follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one 
another up. <A name=C14V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't overthrow God's work for food's 
sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a 
stumbling block by eating. <A name=C14V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is good to not eat meat, drink 
wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made 
weak. 
<P><A name=C14V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do you have faith? Have it to yourself 
before God. Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves. <A 
name=C14V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he who doubts is condemned if he 
eats, because it isn't of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. 
<P><A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N9"><A name=C14V24><FONT

<A name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again, Isaiah says, 
<P>&nbsp;"There will be the root of 
Jesse,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who arises to rule over the 
Gentiles;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On him will the Gentiles hope." 

<P><A name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now may the God of hope fill you with 
all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the 
Holy Spirit. <A name=C15V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I myself am also persuaded about you, 
my <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N11">brothers</A>, that 
you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to 
admonish others. <A name=C15V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I write the more boldly to you in 
part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God, <A 
name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that I should be a servant of Christ 
Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the Gospel of God, that the 
offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy 
Spirit. <A name=C15V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I have therefore my boasting in Christ 
Jesus in things pertaining to God. <A name=C15V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I will not dare to speak of any 
things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the 
Gentiles, by word and deed, <A name=C15V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in the power of signs and wonders, in 
the power of God's Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to 
Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ; <A name=C15V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>yes, making it my 
aim to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not 
build on another's foundation. <A name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But, as it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"They will see, to whom no news of him 
came.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who haven't heard will 
understand." 
<P><A name=C15V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore also I was hindered these 
many times from coming to you, <A name=C15V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but now, no longer having any place in 
these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you, <A 
name=C15V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>whenever I journey to Spain, I will 
come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way 
there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while. <A 
name=C15V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now, I say, I am going to 
Jerusalem, serving the saints. <A name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it has been the good pleasure of 
Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the 
saints who are at Jerusalem. <A name=C15V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yes, it has been their good pleasure, 
and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of 
their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly 
things. <A name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore I have accomplished 
this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain. 
<A name=C15V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know that, when I come to you, I 
will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ. 
<P><A name=C15V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in 
your prayers to God for me, <A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that I may be delivered from those who 
are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be 
acceptable to the saints; <A name=C15V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that I may come to you in joy through 
the will of God, and together with you, find rest. <A name=C15V33><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the God of 
peace be with you all. Amen. 
<P><A name=C16V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, 
who is a <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N12">servant</A> of 
the assembly that is at Cenchreae, <A name=C16V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that you receive her in the Lord, in a 
way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may 
need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own 
self. 
<P><A name=C16V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow 
workers in Christ Jesus, <A name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who for my life, laid down their own 
necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the 
Gentiles. <A name=C16V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet the assembly that is in their 
house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ. 
<A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Mary, who labored much for us. <A 
name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Andronicus and Junias, my 
relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also 
were in Christ before me. <A name=C16V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord. 
<A name=C16V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in 
Christ, and Stachys, my beloved. <A name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. 
Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus. <A name=C16V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Herodion, my 
kinsman. Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. <A 
name=C16V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who 
labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord. <A 
name=C16V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, 
and his mother and mine. <A name=C16V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, 
Patrobas, Hermas, and the <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Romans.htm#N13">brothers</A> who are with 
them. <A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and 
his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. <A 
name=C16V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
The assemblies of Christ greet you. 
<P><A name=C16V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I beg you, brothers, look out for 
those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the 
doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them. <A name=C16V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For those who are 
such don't serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their 
smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent. <A 
name=C16V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For your obedience has become known to 
all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise in that which 
is good, but innocent in that which is evil. <A name=C16V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And the God of 
peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ be with you. 
<P><A name=C16V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, 
as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives. <A name=C16V22><FONT

write the letter, greet you in the Lord. <A name=C16V23><FONT

host of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, 
greets you, as does Quartus, the brother. <A name=C16V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.<A name=C16V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT
