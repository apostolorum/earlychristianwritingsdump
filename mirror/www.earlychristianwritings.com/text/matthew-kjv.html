<H3>Bible, King James Version (KJV)</H3>
<HR>

<H2>Matthew</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.1</H3>[<B>1</B>] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of 
David, the son of Abraham.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat 
Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;<BR>[<B>3</B>] And Judas begat 
Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat 
Aram;<BR>[<B>4</B>] And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and 
Naasson begat Salmon;<BR>[<B>5</B>] And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz 
begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;<BR>[<B>6</B>] And Jesse begat David 
the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of 
Urias;<BR>[<B>7</B>] And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia 
begat Asa;<BR>[<B>8</B>] And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and 
Joram begat Ozias;<BR>[<B>9</B>] And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat 
Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;<BR>[<B>10</B>] And Ezekias begat Manasses; and 
Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;<BR>[<B>11</B>] And Josias begat 
Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to 
Babylon:<BR>[<B>12</B>] And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat 
Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;<BR>[<B>13</B>] And Zorobabel begat 
Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;<BR>[<B>14</B>] And Azor 
begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat 
Jacob;<BR>[<B>16</B>] And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was 
born Jesus, who is called Christ.<BR>[<B>17</B>] So all the generations from 
Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying 
away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into 
Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Now the birth of 
Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, 
before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy 
Ghost.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing 
to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away 
privily.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel 
of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, 
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is 
of the Holy Ghost.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And she shall bring forth a son, and thou 
shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their 
sins.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,<BR>[<B>23</B>] Behold, a virgin shall 
be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name 
Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Then Joseph 
being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took 
unto him his wife:<BR>[<B>25</B>] And knew her not till she had brought forth 
her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.2</H3>[<B>1</B>] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the 
days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to 
Jerusalem,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for 
we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem 
with him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when he had gathered all the chief priests and 
scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be 
born.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it 
is written by the prophet,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And thou Bethlehem, in the land of 
Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a 
Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Then Herod, when he 
had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star 
appeared.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search 
diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, 
that I may come and worship him also.<BR>[<B>9</B>] When they had heard the 
king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before 
them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.<BR>[<B>10</B>] When 
they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And 
when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his 
mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their 
treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and 
myrrh.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And being warned of God in a dream that they should not 
return to Herod, they departed into their own country another 
way.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord 
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his 
mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for 
Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] When he arose, he 
took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into 
Egypt:<BR>[<B>15</B>] And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have 
I called my son.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of 
the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children 
that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and 
under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise 
men.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the 
prophet, saying,<BR>[<B>18</B>] In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, 
and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not 
be comforted, because they are not.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But when Herod was dead, 
behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in 
Egypt,<BR>[<B>20</B>] Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, 
and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's 
life.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and 
came into the land of Israel.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But when he heard that Archelaus 
did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go 
thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into 
the parts of Galilee:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he came and dwelt in a city called 
Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall 
be called a Nazarene.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.3</H3>[<B>1</B>] In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the 
wilderness of Judaea,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of 
heaven is at hand.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For this is he that was spoken of by the 
prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye 
the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And the same John 
had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his 
meat was locusts and wild honey.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Then went out to him Jerusalem, 
and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And were 
baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But when he saw 
many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O 
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to 
come?<BR>[<B>8</B>] Bring forth therefore fruits meet for 
repentance:<BR>[<B>9</B>] And think not to say within yourselves, We have 
Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to 
raise up children unto Abraham.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And now also the axe is laid unto 
the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit 
is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<BR>[<B>11</B>] I indeed baptize you with 
water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose 
shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and 
with fire:<BR>[<B>12</B>] Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge 
his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff 
with unquenchable fire.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan 
unto John, to be baptized of him.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But John forbad him, saying, I 
have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?<BR>[<B>15</B>] And 
Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us 
to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And Jesus, 
when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens 
were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and 
lighting upon him:<BR>[<B>17</B>] And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.4</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the 
wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when he had fasted 
forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And when 
the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these 
stones be made bread.<BR>[<B>4</B>] But he answered and said, It is written, Man 
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and 
setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And saith unto him, If 
thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his 
angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest 
at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Jesus said unto 
him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.<BR>[<B>8</B>] 
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him 
all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;<BR>[<B>9</B>] And saith 
unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship 
me.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is 
written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou 
serve.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and 
ministered unto him.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast 
into prison, he departed into Galilee;<BR>[<B>13</B>] And leaving Nazareth, he 
came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of 
Zabulon and Nephthalim:<BR>[<B>14</B>] That it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,<BR>[<B>15</B>] The land of Zabulon, and 
the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the 
Gentiles;<BR>[<B>16</B>] The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and 
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung 
up.<BR>[<B>17</B>] From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for 
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Jesus, walking by the sea 
of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, 
casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he saith 
unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And 
they straightway left their nets, and followed him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And going on 
from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his 
brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called 
them.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And they immediately left the ship and their father, and 
followed him.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their 
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of 
sickness and all manner of disease among the people.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And his fame 
went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were 
taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with 
devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he 
healed them.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And there followed him great multitudes of people 
from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from 
beyond Jordan.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.5</H3>[<B>1</B>] And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: 
and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:<BR>[<B>2</B>] And he opened 
his mouth, and taught them, saying,<BR>[<B>3</B>] Blessed are the poor in 
spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Blessed are they that 
mourn: for they shall be comforted.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Blessed are the meek: for they 
shall inherit the earth.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Blessed are they which do hunger and 
thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Blessed are 
the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Blessed are the pure in 
heart: for they shall see God.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Blessed are the peacemakers: for 
they shall be called the children of God.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Blessed are they which 
are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute 
you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my 
sake.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in 
heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before 
you.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his 
savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to 
be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Ye are the 
light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<BR>[<B>15</B>] 
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; 
and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Let your 
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your 
Father which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Think not that I am come to destroy 
the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to 
fulfil.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, 
one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be 
fulfilled.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least 
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the 
kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be 
called great in the kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For I say unto you, That 
except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and 
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>21</B>] 
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and 
whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<BR>[<B>22</B>] But I 
say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be 
in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall 
be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in 
danger of hell fire.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the 
altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against 
thee;<BR>[<B>24</B>] Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; 
first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy 
gift.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the 
way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the 
judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast 
paid the uttermost farthing.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Ye have heard that it was said by 
them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:<BR>[<B>28</B>] But I say unto 
you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery 
with her already in his heart.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And if thy right eye offend thee, 
pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of 
thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into 
hell.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it 
from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, 
and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<BR>[<B>31</B>] It hath 
been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of 
divorcement:<BR>[<B>32</B>] But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away 
his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: 
and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth 
adultery.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of 
old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine 
oaths:<BR>[<B>34</B>] But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; 
for it is God's throne:<BR>[<B>35</B>] Nor by the earth; for it is his 
footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great 
King.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst 
not make one hair white or black.<BR>[<B>37</B>] But let your communication be, 
Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of 
evil.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, 
and a tooth for a tooth:<BR>[<B>39</B>] But I say unto you, That ye resist not 
evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other 
also.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy 
coat, let him have thy cloke also.<BR>[<B>41</B>] And whosoever shall compel 
thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<BR>[<B>42</B>] Give to him that asketh 
thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.<BR>[<B>43</B>] 
Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate 
thine enemy.<BR>[<B>44</B>] But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them 
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which 
despitefully use you, and persecute you;<BR>[<B>45</B>] That ye may be the 
children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the 
evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the 
unjust.<BR>[<B>46</B>] For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? 
do not even the publicans the same?<BR>[<B>47</B>] And if ye salute your 
brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans 
so?<BR>[<B>48</B>] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in 
heaven is perfect.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.6</H3>[<B>1</B>] Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be 
seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in 
heaven.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a 
trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, 
that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their 
reward.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what 
thy right hand doeth:<BR>[<B>4</B>] That thine alms may be in secret: and thy 
Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to 
pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may 
be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But 
thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy 
door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in 
secret shall reward thee openly.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But when ye pray, use not vain 
repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for 
their much speaking.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your 
Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<BR>[<B>9</B>] 
After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be 
thy name.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is 
in heaven.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Give us this day our daily bread.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And lead us not 
into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the 
power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For if ye forgive men their 
trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<BR>[<B>15</B>] But if ye 
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your 
trespasses.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of 
a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men 
to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But thou, 
when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;<BR>[<B>18</B>] That 
thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and 
thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Lay 
not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, 
and where thieves break through and steal:<BR>[<B>20</B>] But lay up for 
yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and 
where thieves do not break through nor steal:<BR>[<B>21</B>] For where your 
treasure is, there will your heart be also.<BR>[<B>22</B>] The light of the body 
is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of 
light.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of 
darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that 
darkness!<BR>[<B>24</B>] No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate 
the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the 
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Therefore I say unto you, 
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor 
yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the 
body than raiment?<BR>[<B>26</B>] Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, 
neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth 
them. Are ye not much better than they?<BR>[<B>27</B>] Which of you by taking 
thought can add one cubit unto his stature?<BR>[<B>28</B>] And why take ye 
thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil 
not, neither do they spin:<BR>[<B>29</B>] And yet I say unto you, That even 
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<BR>[<B>30</B>] 
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to 
morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little 
faith?<BR>[<B>31</B>] Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, 
What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<BR>[<B>32</B>] (For 
after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth 
that ye have need of all these things.<BR>[<B>33</B>] But seek ye first the 
kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto 
you.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow 
shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil 
thereof.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.7</H3>[<B>1</B>] Judge not, that ye be not judged.<BR>[<B>2</B>] For 
with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, 
it shall be measured to you again.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And why beholdest thou the mote 
that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own 
eye?<BR>[<B>4</B>] Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote 
out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?<BR>[<B>5</B>] Thou 
hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see 
clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Give not 
that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest 
they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.<BR>[<B>7</B>] 
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be 
opened unto you:<BR>[<B>8</B>] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that 
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Or 
what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a 
stone?<BR>[<B>10</B>] Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a 
serpent?<BR>[<B>11</B>] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto 
your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good 
things to them that ask him?<BR>[<B>12</B>] Therefore all things whatsoever ye 
would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and 
the prophets.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the 
gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which 
go in thereat:<BR>[<B>14</B>] Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, 
which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Beware of 
false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are 
ravening wolves.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men 
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?<BR>[<B>17</B>] Even so every good 
tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil 
fruit.<BR>[<B>18</B>] A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a 
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Every tree that bringeth not 
forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Wherefore 
by their fruits ye shall know them.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Not every one that saith unto 
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the 
will of my Father which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Many will say to me in that 
day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast 
out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<BR>[<B>23</B>] And then 
will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work 
iniquity.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and 
doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a 
rock:<BR>[<B>25</B>] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds 
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a 
rock.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth 
them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the 
sand:<BR>[<B>27</B>] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds 
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of 
it.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the 
people were astonished at his doctrine:<BR>[<B>29</B>] For he taught them as one 
having authority, and not as the scribes.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.8</H3>[<B>1</B>] When he was come down from the mountain, great 
multitudes followed him.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And, behold, there came a leper and 
worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me 
clean.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I 
will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And 
Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the 
priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto 
them.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto 
him a centurion, beseeching him,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And saying, Lord, my servant 
lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And Jesus 
saith unto him, I will come and heal him.<BR>[<B>8</B>] The centurion answered 
and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but 
speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.<BR>[<B>9</B>] For I am a 
man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he 
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he 
doeth it.<BR>[<B>10</B>] When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them 
that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not 
in Israel.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east 
and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom 
of heaven.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into 
outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it 
done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and 
sick of a fever.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: 
and she arose, and ministered unto them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] When the even was come, 
they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the 
spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:<BR>[<B>17</B>] That it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took 
our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Now when Jesus saw 
great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other 
side.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I 
will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And Jesus saith unto 
him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of 
man hath not where to lay his head.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And another of his disciples 
said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their 
dead.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed 
him.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, 
insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was 
asleep.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, 
Lord, save us: we perish.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And he saith unto them, Why are ye 
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; 
and there was a great calm.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But the men marvelled, saying, What 
manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!<BR>[<B>28</B>] 
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there 
met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so 
that no man might pass by that way.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And, behold, they cried out, 
saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come 
hither to torment us before the time?<BR>[<B>30</B>] And there was a good way 
off from them an herd of many swine feeding.<BR>[<B>31</B>] So the devils 
besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of 
swine.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, 
they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran 
violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the 
waters.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into 
the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the 
devils.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and 
when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their 
coasts.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.9</H3>[<B>1</B>] And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came 
into his own city.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of 
the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of 
the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And, 
behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man 
blasphemeth.<BR>[<B>4</B>] And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore 
think ye evil in your hearts?<BR>[<B>5</B>] For whether is easier, to say, Thy 
sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?<BR>[<B>6</B>] But that ye may 
know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to 
the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine 
house.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And he arose, and departed to his house.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But 
when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given 
such power unto men.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw 
a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, 
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And it came to pass, 
as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and 
sat down with him and his disciples.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And when the Pharisees saw 
it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and 
sinners?<BR>[<B>12</B>] But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that 
be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But go ye 
and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not 
come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Then came 
to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but 
thy disciples fast not?<BR>[<B>15</B>] And Jesus said unto them, Can the 
children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but 
the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall 
they fast.<BR>[<B>16</B>] No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old 
garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the 
rent is made worse.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: 
else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but 
they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.<BR>[<B>18</B>] While 
he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and 
worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand 
upon her, and she shall live.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And Jesus arose, and followed him, 
and so did his disciples.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And, behold, a woman, which was 
diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the 
hem of his garment:<BR>[<B>21</B>] For she said within herself, If I may but 
touch his garment, I shall be whole.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But Jesus turned him about, 
and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made 
thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when 
Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a 
noise,<BR>[<B>24</B>] He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, 
but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But when the people 
were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid 
arose.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And the fame hereof went abroad into all that 
land.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, 
crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And when 
he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto 
them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, 
Lord.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith 
be it unto you.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly 
charged them, saying, See that no man know it.<BR>[<B>31</B>] But they, when 
they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.<BR>[<B>32</B>] 
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a 
devil.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the 
multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.<BR>[<B>34</B>] But 
the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the 
devils.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, 
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and 
healing every sickness and every disease among the people.<BR>[<B>36</B>] But 
when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they 
fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.<BR>[<B>37</B>] 
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the 
labourers are few;<BR>[<B>38</B>] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, 
that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.10</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, 
he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all 
manner of sickness and all manner of disease.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Now the names of the 
twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his 
brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;<BR>[<B>3</B>] Philip, 
and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, 
and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;<BR>[<B>4</B>] Simon the Canaanite, 
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.<BR>[<B>5</B>] These twelve Jesus sent 
forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into 
any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:<BR>[<B>6</B>] But go rather to the lost 
sheep of the house of Israel.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And as ye go, preach, saying, The 
kingdom of heaven is at hand.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, 
raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely 
give.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your 
purses,<BR>[<B>10</B>] Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither 
shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And 
into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and 
there abide till ye go thence.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when ye come into an house, 
salute it.<BR>[<B>13</B>] And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon 
it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that 
house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Verily I say unto 
you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of 
judgment, than for that city.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Behold, I send you forth as sheep 
in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as 
doves.<BR>[<B>17</B>] But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the 
councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;<BR>[<B>18</B>] And ye 
shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against 
them and the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>19</B>] But when they deliver you up, take no 
thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour 
what ye shall speak.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit 
of your Father which speaketh in you.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And the brother shall 
deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children 
shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to 
death.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but 
he that endureth to the end shall be saved.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But when they 
persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye 
shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be 
come.<BR>[<B>24</B>] The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above 
his lord.<BR>[<B>25</B>] It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, 
and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house 
Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be 
revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<BR>[<B>27</B>] What I tell you in 
darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye 
upon the housetops.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And fear not them which kill the body, but 
are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both 
soul and body in hell.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? 
and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.<BR>[<B>30</B>] 
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Fear ye not 
therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Whosoever 
therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father 
which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>33</B>] But whosoever shall deny me before men, him 
will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Think not 
that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a 
sword.<BR>[<B>35</B>] For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, 
and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother 
in law.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And a man's foes shall be they of his own 
household.<BR>[<B>37</B>] He that loveth father or mother more than me is not 
worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of 
me.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is 
not worthy of me.<BR>[<B>39</B>] He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he 
that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<BR>[<B>40</B>] He that receiveth 
you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent 
me.<BR>[<B>41</B>] He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall 
receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of 
a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<BR>[<B>42</B>] And 
whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water 
only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose 
his reward.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.11</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of 
commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in 
their cities.<BR>[<B>2</B>] Now when John had heard in the prison the works of 
Christ, he sent two of his disciples,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And said unto him, Art thou 
he that should come, or do we look for another?<BR>[<B>4</B>] Jesus answered and 
said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and 
see:<BR>[<B>5</B>] The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers 
are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the 
gospel preached to them.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be 
offended in me.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the 
multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed 
shaken with the wind?<BR>[<B>8</B>] But what went ye out for to see? A man 
clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' 
houses.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say 
unto you, and more than a prophet.<BR>[<B>10</B>] For this is he, of whom it is 
written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy 
way before thee.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born 
of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding 
he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And 
from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth 
violence, and the violent take it by force.<BR>[<B>13</B>] For all the prophets 
and the law prophesied until John.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And if ye will receive it, 
this is Elias, which was for to come.<BR>[<B>15</B>] He that hath ears to hear, 
let him hear.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is 
like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their 
fellows,<BR>[<B>17</B>] And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not 
danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.<BR>[<B>18</B>] For 
John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a 
devil.<BR>[<B>19</B>] The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, 
Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. 
But wisdom is justified of her children.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Then began he to upbraid 
the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented 
not:<BR>[<B>21</B>] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if 
the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they 
would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But I say 
unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, 
than for you.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, 
shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in 
thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this 
day.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the 
land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.<BR>[<B>25</B>] At that time 
Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, 
because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed 
them unto babes.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy 
sight.<BR>[<B>27</B>] All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man 
knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the 
Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Come unto me, 
all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<BR>[<B>29</B>] 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye 
shall find rest unto your souls.<BR>[<B>30</B>] For my yoke is easy, and my 
burden is light.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.12</H3>[<B>1</B>] At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through 
the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of 
corn, and to eat.<BR>[<B>2</B>] But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto 
him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath 
day.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when 
he was an hungred, and they that were with him;<BR>[<B>4</B>] How he entered 
into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him 
to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the 
priests?<BR>[<B>5</B>] Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath 
days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are 
blameless?<BR>[<B>6</B>] But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater 
than the temple.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will 
have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the 
guiltless.<BR>[<B>8</B>] For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath 
day.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when he was departed thence, he went into their 
synagogue:<BR>[<B>10</B>] And, behold, there was a man which had his hand 
withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? 
that they might accuse him.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And he said unto them, What man shall 
there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the 
sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?<BR>[<B>12</B>] How 
much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the 
sabbath days.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. 
And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the 
other.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against 
him, how they might destroy him.<BR>[<B>15</B>] But when Jesus knew it, he 
withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed 
them all;<BR>[<B>16</B>] And charged them that they should not make him 
known:<BR>[<B>17</B>] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the 
prophet, saying,<BR>[<B>18</B>] Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my 
beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he 
shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.<BR>[<B>19</B>] He shall not strive, nor 
cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.<BR>[<B>20</B>] A 
bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he 
send forth judgment unto victory.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And in his name shall the 
Gentiles trust.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then was brought unto him one possessed with a 
devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both 
spake and saw.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not 
this the son of David?<BR>[<B>24</B>] But when the Pharisees heard it, they 
said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the 
devils.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every 
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house 
divided against itself shall not stand:<BR>[<B>26</B>] And if Satan cast out 
Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom 
stand?<BR>[<B>27</B>] And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your 
children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But 
if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto 
you.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and 
spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his 
house.<BR>[<B>30</B>] He that is not with me is against me; and he that 
gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Wherefore I say unto 
you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the 
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.<BR>[<B>32</B>] 
And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: 
but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, 
neither in this world, neither in the world to come.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Either make 
the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit 
corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.<BR>[<B>34</B>] O generation of 
vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of 
the heart the mouth speaketh.<BR>[<B>35</B>] A good man out of the good treasure 
of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil 
treasure bringeth forth evil things.<BR>[<B>36</B>] But I say unto you, That 
every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day 
of judgment.<BR>[<B>37</B>] For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy 
words thou shalt be condemned.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Then certain of the scribes and of 
the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from 
thee.<BR>[<B>39</B>] But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous 
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the 
sign of the prophet Jonas:<BR>[<B>40</B>] For as Jonas was three days and three 
nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three 
nights in the heart of the earth.<BR>[<B>41</B>] The men of Nineveh shall rise 
in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at 
the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is 
here.<BR>[<B>42</B>] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with 
this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of 
the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is 
here.<BR>[<B>43</B>] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh 
through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<BR>[<B>44</B>] Then he 
saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, 
he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Then goeth he, and 
taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter 
in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even 
so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.<BR>[<B>46</B>] While he yet 
talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, 
desiring to speak with him.<BR>[<B>47</B>] Then one said unto him, Behold, thy 
mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with 
thee.<BR>[<B>48</B>] But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my 
mother? and who are my brethren?<BR>[<B>49</B>] And he stretched forth his hand 
toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<BR>[<B>50</B>] 
For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my 
brother, and sister, and mother.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.13</H3>[<B>1</B>] The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by 
the sea side.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And great multitudes were gathered together unto 
him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the 
shore.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, 
Behold, a sower went forth to sow;<BR>[<B>4</B>] And when he sowed, some seeds 
fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:<BR>[<B>5</B>] 
Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they 
sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when the sun 
was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered 
away.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and 
choked them:<BR>[<B>8</B>] But other fell into good ground, and brought forth 
fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Who 
hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And the disciples came, and said 
unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?<BR>[<B>11</B>] He answered 
and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the 
kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For whosoever 
hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever 
hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.<BR>[<B>13</B>] 
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing 
they hear not, neither do they understand.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And in them is 
fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and 
shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not 
perceive:<BR>[<B>15</B>] For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears 
are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they 
should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with 
their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But 
blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they 
hear.<BR>[<B>17</B>] For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous 
men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and 
to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Hear 
ye therefore the parable of the sower.<BR>[<B>19</B>] When any one heareth the 
word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and 
catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed 
by the way side.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But he that received the seed into stony places, 
the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth 
it;<BR>[<B>21</B>] Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for 
when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is 
offended.<BR>[<B>22</B>] He also that received seed among the thorns is he that 
heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, 
choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But he that received 
seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; 
which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, 
some thirty.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The 
kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his 
field:<BR>[<B>25</B>] But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among 
the wheat, and went his way.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But when the blade was sprung up, 
and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.<BR>[<B>27</B>] So the 
servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good 
seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?<BR>[<B>28</B>] He said unto 
them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that 
we go and gather them up?<BR>[<B>29</B>] But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather 
up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.<BR>[<B>30</B>] Let both grow 
together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the 
reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn 
them: but gather the wheat into my barn.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Another parable put he 
forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard 
seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:<BR>[<B>32</B>] Which indeed is 
the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, 
and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches 
thereof.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of 
heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of 
meal, till the whole was leavened.<BR>[<B>34</B>] All these things spake Jesus 
unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto 
them:<BR>[<B>35</B>] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, 
saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been 
kept secret from the foundation of the world.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Then Jesus sent the 
multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, 
saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.<BR>[<B>37</B>] He 
answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of 
man;<BR>[<B>38</B>] The field is the world; the good seed are the children of 
the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;<BR>[<B>39</B>] 
The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and 
the reapers are the angels.<BR>[<B>40</B>] As therefore the tares are gathered 
and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.<BR>[<B>41</B>] 
The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his 
kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;<BR>[<B>42</B>] And 
shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of 
teeth.<BR>[<B>43</B>] Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the 
kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>[<B>44</B>] 
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which 
when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that 
he hath, and buyeth that field.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Again, the kingdom of heaven is 
like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:<BR>[<B>46</B>] Who, when he had 
found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought 
it.<BR>[<B>47</B>] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was 
cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<BR>[<B>48</B>] Which, when it was 
full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but 
cast the bad away.<BR>[<B>49</B>] So shall it be at the end of the world: the 
angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the 
just,<BR>[<B>50</B>] And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall 
be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR>[<B>51</B>] Jesus saith unto them, Have ye 
understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR>[<B>52</B>] Then 
said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom 
of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of 
his treasure things new and old.<BR>[<B>53</B>] And it came to pass, that when 
Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.<BR>[<B>54</B>] And when 
he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch 
that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these 
mighty works?<BR>[<B>55</B>] Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother 
called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and 
Judas?<BR>[<B>56</B>] And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then 
hath this man all these things?<BR>[<B>57</B>] And they were offended in him. 
But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own 
country, and in his own house.<BR>[<B>58</B>] And he did not many mighty works 
there because of their unbelief.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.14</H3>[<B>1</B>] At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of 
Jesus,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is 
risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in 
him.<BR>[<B>3</B>] For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him 
in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.<BR>[<B>4</B>] For John 
said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when he 
would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him 
as a prophet.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of 
Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Whereupon he 
promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And 
she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's 
head in a charger.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the 
oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given 
her.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought 
it to her mother.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And his disciples came, and took up the body, 
and buried it, and went and told Jesus.<BR>[<B>13</B>] When Jesus heard of it, 
he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had 
heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion 
toward them, and he healed their sick.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And when it was evening, 
his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now 
past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy 
themselves victuals.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But Jesus said unto them, They need not 
depart; give ye them to eat.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And they say unto him, We have here 
but five loaves, and two fishes.<BR>[<B>18</B>] He said, Bring them hither to 
me.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and 
took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, 
and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the 
multitude.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took 
up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And they 
that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and 
children.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get 
into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the 
multitudes away.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And when he had sent the multitudes away, he 
went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was 
there alone.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed 
with waves: for the wind was contrary.<BR>[<B>25</B>] And in the fourth watch of 
the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And when the 
disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a 
spirit; and they cried out for fear.<BR>[<B>27</B>] But straightway Jesus spake 
unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And 
Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the 
water.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the 
ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But when he saw the 
wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, 
save me.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and 
caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou 
doubt?<BR>[<B>32</B>] And when they were come into the ship, the wind 
ceased.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, 
saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.<BR>[<B>34</B>] And when they were 
gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And when the 
men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country 
round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;<BR>[<B>36</B>] And 
besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as 
touched were made perfectly whole.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.15</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were 
of Jerusalem, saying,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Why do thy disciples transgress the 
tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat 
bread.<BR>[<B>3</B>] But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also 
transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?<BR>[<B>4</B>] For God 
commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or 
mother, let him die the death.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But ye say, Whosoever shall say to 
his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited 
by me;<BR>[<B>6</B>] And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. 
Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your 
tradition.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, 
saying,<BR>[<B>8</B>] This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and 
honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But 
in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of 
men.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and 
understand:<BR>[<B>11</B>] Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; 
but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then 
came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were 
offended, after they heard this saying?<BR>[<B>13</B>] But he answered and said, 
Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted 
up.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if 
the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Then 
answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.<BR>[<B>16</B>] 
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?<BR>[<B>17</B>] Do not ye 
yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, 
and is cast out into the draught?<BR>[<B>18</B>] But those things which proceed 
out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the 
man.<BR>[<B>19</B>] For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, 
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:<BR>[<B>20</B>] 
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth 
not a man.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts 
of Tyre and Sidon.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the 
same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of 
David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But he 
answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send 
her away; for she crieth after us.<BR>[<B>24</B>] But he answered and said, I am 
not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then 
came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But he 
answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it 
to dogs.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the 
crumbs which fall from their masters' table.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Then Jesus answered 
and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou 
wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And 
Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up 
into a mountain, and sat down there.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And great multitudes came 
unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many 
others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:<BR>[<B>31</B>] 
Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the 
maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified 
the God of Israel.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and 
said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now 
three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest 
they faint in the way.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And his disciples say unto him, Whence 
should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a 
multitude?<BR>[<B>34</B>] And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? 
And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And he commanded 
the multitude to sit down on the ground.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And he took the seven 
loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his 
disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And they did all 
eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven 
baskets full.<BR>[<B>38</B>] And they that did eat were four thousand men, 
beside women and children.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he sent away the multitude, and 
took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.16</H3>[<B>1</B>] The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and 
tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.<BR>[<B>2</B>] 
He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair 
weather: for the sky is red.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And in the morning, It will be foul 
weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern 
the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the 
times?<BR>[<B>4</B>] A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; 
and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And 
he left them, and departed.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And when his disciples were come to 
the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Then Jesus said 
unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the 
Sadducees.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is 
because we have taken no bread.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Which when Jesus perceived, he 
said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye 
have brought no bread?<BR>[<B>9</B>] Do ye not yet understand, neither remember 
the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took 
up?<BR>[<B>10</B>] Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many 
baskets ye took up?<BR>[<B>11</B>] How is it that ye do not understand that I 
spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the 
Pharisees and of the Sadducees?<BR>[<B>12</B>] Then understood they how that he 
bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the 
Pharisees and of the Sadducees.<BR>[<B>13</B>] When Jesus came into the coasts 
of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the 
Son of man am?<BR>[<B>14</B>] And they said, Some say that thou art John the 
Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the 
prophets.<BR>[<B>15</B>] He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I 
am?<BR>[<B>16</B>] And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the 
Son of the living God.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto 
thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And I say also unto thee, 
That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And I will give unto thee the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be 
bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in 
heaven.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no 
man that he was Jesus the Christ.<BR>[<B>21</B>] From that time forth began 
Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer 
many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be 
raised again the third day.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Then Peter took him, and began to 
rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto 
thee.<BR>[<B>23</B>] But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, 
Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of 
God, but those that be of men.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Then said Jesus unto his 
disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his 
cross, and follow me.<BR>[<B>25</B>] For whosoever will save his life shall lose 
it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own 
soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<BR>[<B>27</B>] For the 
Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he 
shall reward every man according to his works.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Verily I say unto 
you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see 
the Son of man coming in his kingdom.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.17</H3>[<B>1</B>] And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and 
John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain 
apart,<BR>[<B>2</B>] And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as 
the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And, behold, 
there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Then 
answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou 
wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and 
one for Elias.<BR>[<B>5</B>] While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud 
overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And when the 
disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.<BR>[<B>7</B>] 
And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not 
afraid.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, 
save Jesus only.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus 
charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen 
again from the dead.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And his disciples asked him, saying, Why 
then say the scribes that Elias must first come?<BR>[<B>11</B>] And Jesus 
answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all 
things.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they 
knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also 
the Son of man suffer of them.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then the disciples understood that 
he spake unto them of John the Baptist.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And when they were come 
to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and 
saying,<BR>[<B>15</B>] Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore 
vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the 
water.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not 
cure him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse 
generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him 
hither to me.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of 
him: and the child was cured from that very hour.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Then came the 
disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him 
out?<BR>[<B>20</B>] And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for 
verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say 
unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and 
nothing shall be impossible unto you.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Howbeit this kind goeth not 
out but by prayer and fasting.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And while they abode in Galilee, 
Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of 
men:<BR>[<B>23</B>] And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be 
raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when they were 
come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, 
Doth not your master pay tribute?<BR>[<B>25</B>] He saith, Yes. And when he was 
come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of 
whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or 
of strangers?<BR>[<B>26</B>] Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith 
unto him, Then are the children free.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Notwithstanding, lest we 
should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish 
that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a 
piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.18</H3>[<B>1</B>] At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, 
saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?<BR>[<B>2</B>] And Jesus 
called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,<BR>[<B>3</B>] 
And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little 
children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Whosoever 
therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the 
kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And whoso shall receive one such little child 
in my name receiveth me.<BR>[<B>6</B>] But whoso shall offend one of these 
little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were 
hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the 
sea.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be 
that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence 
cometh!<BR>[<B>8</B>] Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them 
off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or 
maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting 
fire.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from 
thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having 
two eyes to be cast into hell fire.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Take heed that ye despise not 
one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do 
always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For the 
Son of man is come to save that which was lost.<BR>[<B>12</B>] How think ye? if 
a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave 
the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is 
gone astray?<BR>[<B>13</B>] And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, 
he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not 
astray.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in 
heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Moreover if 
thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee 
and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy 
brother.<BR>[<B>16</B>] But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or 
two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be 
established.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto 
the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an 
heathen man and a publican.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye 
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on 
earth shall be loosed in heaven.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Again I say unto you, That if 
two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it 
shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.<BR>[<B>20</B>] For where 
two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of 
them.<BR>[<B>21</B>] Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my 
brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?<BR>[<B>22</B>] 
Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy 
times seven.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a 
certain king, which would take account of his servants.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when 
he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand 
talents.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded 
him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to 
be made.<BR>[<B>26</B>] The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, 
saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.<BR>[<B>27</B>] 
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and 
forgave him the debt.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But the same servant went out, and found 
one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on 
him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.<BR>[<B>29</B>] 
And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have 
patience with me, and I will pay thee all.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And he would not: but 
went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.<BR>[<B>31</B>] So 
when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and 
told unto their lord all that was done.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Then his lord, after that 
he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that 
debt, because thou desiredst me:<BR>[<B>33</B>] Shouldest not thou also have had 
compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?<BR>[<B>34</B>] And 
his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all 
that was due unto him.<BR>[<B>35</B>] So likewise shall my heavenly Father do 
also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their 
trespasses.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.19</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished 
these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea 
beyond Jordan;<BR>[<B>2</B>] And great multitudes followed him; and he healed 
them there.<BR>[<B>3</B>] The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and 
saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every 
cause?<BR>[<B>4</B>] And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that 
he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,<BR>[<B>5</B>] And 
said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to 
his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?<BR>[<B>6</B>] Wherefore they are no 
more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man 
put asunder.<BR>[<B>7</B>] They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give 
a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?<BR>[<B>8</B>] He saith unto them, 
Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your 
wives: but from the beginning it was not so.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And I say unto you, 
Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry 
another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth 
commit adultery.<BR>[<B>10</B>] His disciples say unto him, If the case of the 
man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.<BR>[<B>11</B>] But he said 
unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is 
given.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their 
mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and 
there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's 
sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then 
were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on 
them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.<BR>[<B>14</B>] But Jesus said, 
Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the 
kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And he laid his hands on them, and departed 
thence.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, 
what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he 
said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, 
God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<BR>[<B>18</B>] He 
saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not 
commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false 
witness,<BR>[<B>19</B>] Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love 
thy neighbour as thyself.<BR>[<B>20</B>] The young man saith unto him, All these 
things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?<BR>[<B>21</B>] Jesus said 
unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the 
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow 
me.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But when the young man heard that saying, he went away 
sorrowful: for he had great possessions.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Then said Jesus unto his 
disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the 
kingdom of heaven.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And again I say unto you, It is easier for a 
camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the 
kingdom of God.<BR>[<B>25</B>] When his disciples heard it, they were 
exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?<BR>[<B>26</B>] But Jesus 
beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all 
things are possible.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Then answered Peter and said unto him, 
Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have 
therefore?<BR>[<B>28</B>] And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That 
ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in 
the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the 
twelve tribes of Israel.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And every one that hath forsaken houses, 
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, 
for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting 
life.<BR>[<B>30</B>] But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall 
be first.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.20</H3>[<B>1</B>] For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is 
an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his 
vineyard.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a 
day, he sent them into his vineyard.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And he went out about the 
third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,<BR>[<B>4</B>] And 
said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will 
give you. And they went their way.<BR>[<B>5</B>] Again he went out about the 
sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And about the eleventh 
hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand 
ye here all the day idle?<BR>[<B>7</B>] They say unto him, Because no man hath 
hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is 
right, that shall ye receive.<BR>[<B>8</B>] So when even was come, the lord of 
the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their 
hire, beginning from the last unto the first.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And when they came 
that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a 
penny.<BR>[<B>10</B>] But when the first came, they supposed that they should 
have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.<BR>[<B>11</B>] 
And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the 
house,<BR>[<B>12</B>] Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou 
hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the 
day.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no 
wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?<BR>[<B>14</B>] Take that thine 
is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto 
thee.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is 
thine eye evil, because I am good?<BR>[<B>16</B>] So the last shall be first, 
and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And Jesus 
going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto 
them,<BR>[<B>18</B>] Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be 
betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him 
to death,<BR>[<B>19</B>] And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to 
scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise 
again.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her 
sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And 
he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two 
sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy 
kingdom.<BR>[<B>22</B>] But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. 
Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with 
the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are 
able.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, 
and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right 
hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for 
whom it is prepared of my Father.<BR>[<B>24</B>] And when the ten heard it, they 
were moved with indignation against the two brethren.<BR>[<B>25</B>] But Jesus 
called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles 
exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon 
them.<BR>[<B>26</B>] But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be 
great among you, let him be your minister;<BR>[<B>27</B>] And whosoever will be 
chief among you, let him be your servant:<BR>[<B>28</B>] Even as the Son of man 
came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom 
for many.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude 
followed him.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, 
when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O 
Lord, thou Son of David.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And the multitude rebuked them, because 
they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, 
O Lord, thou Son of David.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And Jesus stood still, and called 
them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?<BR>[<B>33</B>] They say 
unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.<BR>[<B>34</B>] So Jesus had 
compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received 
sight, and they followed him.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.21</H3>[<B>1</B>] And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come 
to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two 
disciples,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, 
and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and 
bring them unto me.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall 
say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send 
them.<BR>[<B>4</B>] All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken by the prophet, saying,<BR>[<B>5</B>] Tell ye the daughter of Sion, 
Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the 
foal of an ass.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded 
them,<BR>[<B>7</B>] And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their 
clothes, and they set him thereon.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And a very great multitude 
spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and 
strawed them in the way.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And the multitudes that went before, and 
that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that 
cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And when 
he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is 
this?<BR>[<B>11</B>] And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of 
Nazareth of Galilee.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And Jesus went into the temple of God, and 
cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables 
of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,<BR>[<B>13</B>] And 
said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but 
ye have made it a den of thieves.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And the blind and the lame came 
to him in the temple; and he healed them.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And when the chief 
priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children 
crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore 
displeased,<BR>[<B>16</B>] And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And 
Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and 
sucklings thou hast perfected praise?<BR>[<B>17</B>] And he left them, and went 
out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.<BR>[<B>18</B>] Now in the 
morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And when he 
saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves 
only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And 
presently the fig tree withered away.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And when the disciples saw 
it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered 
away!<BR>[<B>21</B>] Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, 
If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the 
fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be 
thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And all things, 
whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.<BR>[<B>23</B>] 
And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the 
people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou 
these things? and who gave thee this authority?<BR>[<B>24</B>] And Jesus 
answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, 
I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned 
with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why 
did ye not then believe him?<BR>[<B>26</B>] But if we shall say, Of men; we fear 
the people; for all hold John as a prophet.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And they answered 
Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by 
what authority I do these things.<BR>[<B>28</B>] But what think ye? A certain 
man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my 
vineyard.<BR>[<B>29</B>] He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he 
repented, and went.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And he came to the second, and said likewise. 
And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Whether of 
them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith 
unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the 
kingdom of God before you.<BR>[<B>32</B>] For John came unto you in the way of 
righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots 
believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might 
believe him.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Hear another parable: There was a certain 
householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a 
winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into 
a far country:<BR>[<B>34</B>] And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent 
his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of 
it.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and 
killed another, and stoned another.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Again, he sent other servants 
more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.<BR>[<B>37</B>] But last of 
all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my 
son.<BR>[<B>38</B>] But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among 
themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his 
inheritance.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And they caught him, and cast him out of the 
vineyard, and slew him.<BR>[<B>40</B>] When the lord therefore of the vineyard 
cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?<BR>[<B>41</B>] They say unto him, 
He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto 
other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their 
seasons.<BR>[<B>42</B>] Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the 
scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head 
of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our 
eyes?<BR>[<B>43</B>] Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken 
from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits 
thereof.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: 
but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<BR>[<B>45</B>] And 
when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that 
he spake of them.<BR>[<B>46</B>] But when they sought to lay hands on him, they 
feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.22</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by 
parables, and said,<BR>[<B>2</B>] The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain 
king, which made a marriage for his son,<BR>[<B>3</B>] And sent forth his 
servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not 
come.<BR>[<B>4</B>] Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which 
are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are 
killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But they 
made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his 
merchandise:<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them 
spitefully, and slew them.<BR>[<B>7</B>] But when the king heard thereof, he was 
wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned 
up their city.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is 
ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Go ye therefore 
into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the 
marriage.<BR>[<B>10</B>] So those servants went out into the highways, and 
gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding 
was furnished with guests.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And when the king came in to see the 
guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:<BR>[<B>12</B>] 
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding 
garment? And he was speechless.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then said the king to the 
servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer 
darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For many 
are called, but few are chosen.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Then went the Pharisees, and took 
counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And they sent 
out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that 
thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any 
man: for thou regardest not the person of men.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Tell us therefore, 
What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or 
not?<BR>[<B>18</B>] But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye 
me, ye hypocrites?<BR>[<B>19</B>] Shew me the tribute money. And they brought 
unto him a penny.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and 
superscription?<BR>[<B>21</B>] They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto 
them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God 
the things that are God's.<BR>[<B>22</B>] When they had heard these words, they 
marvelled, and left him, and went their way.<BR>[<B>23</B>] The same day came to 
him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked 
him,<BR>[<B>24</B>] Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no 
children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his 
brother.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, 
when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto 
his brother:<BR>[<B>26</B>] Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the 
seventh.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And last of all the woman died also.<BR>[<B>28</B>] 
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all 
had her.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not 
knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.<BR>[<B>30</B>] For in the 
resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the 
angels of God in heaven.<BR>[<B>31</B>] But as touching the resurrection of the 
dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, 
saying,<BR>[<B>32</B>] I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the 
God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<BR>[<B>33</B>] 
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his 
doctrine.<BR>[<B>34</B>] But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the 
Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Then one of 
them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and 
saying,<BR>[<B>36</B>] Master, which is the great commandment in the 
law?<BR>[<B>37</B>] Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<BR>[<B>38</B>] This 
is the first and great commandment.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And the second is like unto 
it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<BR>[<B>40</B>] On these two 
commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<BR>[<B>41</B>] While the 
Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,<BR>[<B>42</B>] Saying, What 
think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of 
David.<BR>[<B>43</B>] He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him 
Lord, saying,<BR>[<B>44</B>] The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right 
hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?<BR>[<B>45</B>] If David then call 
him Lord, how is he his son?<BR>[<B>46</B>] And no man was able to answer him a 
word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.23</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his 
disciples,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' 
seat:<BR>[<B>3</B>] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe 
and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.<BR>[<B>4</B>] 
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's 
shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their 
fingers.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they 
make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their 
garments,<BR>[<B>6</B>] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief 
seats in the synagogues,<BR>[<B>7</B>] And greetings in the markets, and to be 
called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But be not ye called Rabbi: for one 
is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And call no 
man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in 
heaven.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, 
even Christ.<BR>[<B>11</B>] But he that is greatest among you shall be your 
servant.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and 
he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But woe unto you, 
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against 
men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering 
to go in.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye 
devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall 
receive the greater damnation.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Woe unto you, scribes and 
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and 
when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than 
yourselves.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever 
shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold 
of the temple, he is a debtor!<BR>[<B>17</B>] Ye fools and blind: for whether is 
greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?<BR>[<B>18</B>] And, 
Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the 
gift that is upon it, he is guilty.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Ye fools and blind: for 
whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the 
gift?<BR>[<B>20</B>] Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, 
and by all things thereon.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And whoso shall swear by the temple, 
sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And he that 
shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth 
thereon.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye 
pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters 
of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to 
leave the other undone.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, 
and swallow a camel.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but 
within they are full of extortion and excess.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Thou blind 
Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the 
outside of them may be clean also.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Woe unto you, scribes and 
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed 
appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all 
uncleanness.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, 
but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Woe unto you, 
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, 
and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,<BR>[<B>30</B>] And say, If we had 
been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in 
the blood of the prophets.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Wherefore ye be witnesses unto 
yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the 
prophets.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Fill ye up then the measure of your 
fathers.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape 
the damnation of hell?<BR>[<B>34</B>] Wherefore, behold, I send unto you 
prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; 
and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from 
city to city:<BR>[<B>35</B>] That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed 
upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son 
of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.<BR>[<B>36</B>] 
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this 
generation.<BR>[<B>37</B>] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the 
prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have 
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her 
wings, and ye would not!<BR>[<B>38</B>] Behold, your house is left unto you 
desolate.<BR>[<B>39</B>] For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, 
till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.24</H3>[<B>1</B>] And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and 
his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the 
temple.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? 
verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that 
shall not be thrown down.<BR>[<B>3</B>] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, 
the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things 
be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the 
world?<BR>[<B>4</B>] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no 
man deceive you.<BR>[<B>5</B>] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am 
Christ; and shall deceive many.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And ye shall hear of wars and 
rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to 
pass, but the end is not yet.<BR>[<B>7</B>] For nation shall rise against 
nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and 
pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.<BR>[<B>8</B>] All these are the 
beginning of sorrows.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then shall they deliver you up to be 
afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my 
name's sake.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And then shall many be offended, and shall betray 
one another, and shall hate one another.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And many false prophets 
shall rise, and shall deceive many.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And because iniquity shall 
abound, the love of many shall wax cold.<BR>[<B>13</B>] But he that shall endure 
unto the end, the same shall be saved.<BR>[<B>14</B>] And this gospel of the 
kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and 
then shall the end come.<BR>[<B>15</B>] When ye therefore shall see the 
abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy 
place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then let them which 
be in Judaea flee into the mountains:<BR>[<B>17</B>] Let him which is on the 
housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:<BR>[<B>18</B>] 
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his 
clothes.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that 
give suck in those days!<BR>[<B>20</B>] But pray ye that your flight be not in 
the winter, neither on the sabbath day:<BR>[<B>21</B>] For then shall be great 
tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, 
nor ever shall be.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And except those days should be shortened, 
there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be 
shortened.<BR>[<B>23</B>] Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is 
Christ, or there; believe it not.<BR>[<B>24</B>] For there shall arise false 
Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch 
that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.<BR>[<B>25</B>] 
Behold, I have told you before.<BR>[<B>26</B>] Wherefore if they shall say unto 
you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret 
chambers; believe it not.<BR>[<B>27</B>] For as the lightning cometh out of the 
east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man 
be.<BR>[<B>28</B>] For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be 
gathered together.<BR>[<B>29</B>] Immediately after the tribulation of those 
days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the 
stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be 
shaken:<BR>[<B>30</B>] And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in 
heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the 
Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great 
glory.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a 
trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one 
end of heaven to the other.<BR>[<B>32</B>] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; 
When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is 
nigh:<BR>[<B>33</B>] So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know 
that it is near, even at the doors.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Verily I say unto you, This 
generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<BR>[<B>35</B>] 
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass 
away.<BR>[<B>36</B>] But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels 
of heaven, but my Father only.<BR>[<B>37</B>] But as the days of Noe were, so 
shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<BR>[<B>38</B>] For as in the days 
that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in 
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,<BR>[<B>39</B>] And knew 
not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of 
the Son of man be.<BR>[<B>40</B>] Then shall two be in the field; the one shall 
be taken, and the other left.<BR>[<B>41</B>] Two women shall be grinding at the 
mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<BR>[<B>42</B>] Watch 
therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.<BR>[<B>43</B>] But 
know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief 
would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be 
broken up.<BR>[<B>44</B>] Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye 
think not the Son of man cometh.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Who then is a faithful and wise 
servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in 
due season?<BR>[<B>46</B>] Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh 
shall find so doing.<BR>[<B>47</B>] Verily I say unto you, That he shall make 
him ruler over all his goods.<BR>[<B>48</B>] But and if that evil servant shall 
say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;<BR>[<B>49</B>] And shall begin to 
smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;<BR>[<B>50</B>] 
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in 
an hour that he is not aware of,<BR>[<B>51</B>] And shall cut him asunder, and 
appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing 
of teeth.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.25</H3>[<B>1</B>] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten 
virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the 
bridegroom.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And five of them were wise, and five were 
foolish.<BR>[<B>3</B>] They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil 
with them:<BR>[<B>4</B>] But the wise took oil in their vessels with their 
lamps.<BR>[<B>5</B>] While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and 
slept.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the 
bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<BR>[<B>7</B>] Then all those virgins 
arose, and trimmed their lamps.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And the foolish said unto the 
wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<BR>[<B>9</B>] But the 
wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go 
ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<BR>[<B>10</B>] And while 
they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him 
to the marriage: and the door was shut.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Afterward came also the 
other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<BR>[<B>12</B>] But he answered 
and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Watch therefore, 
for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man 
cometh.<BR>[<B>14</B>] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a 
far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his 
goods.<BR>[<B>15</B>] And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to 
another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took 
his journey.<BR>[<B>16</B>] Then he that had received the five talents went and 
traded with the same, and made them other five talents.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And 
likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.<BR>[<B>18</B>] But 
he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's 
money.<BR>[<B>19</B>] After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and 
reckoneth with them.<BR>[<B>20</B>] And so he that had received five talents 
came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five 
talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<BR>[<B>21</B>] His 
lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been 
faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou 
into the joy of thy lord.<BR>[<B>22</B>] He also that had received two talents 
came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained 
two other talents beside them.<BR>[<B>23</B>] His lord said unto him, Well done, 
good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will 
make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy 
lord.<BR>[<B>24</B>] Then he which had received the one talent came and said, 
Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, 
and gathering where thou hast not strawed:<BR>[<B>25</B>] And I was afraid, and 
went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is 
thine.<BR>[<B>26</B>] His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and 
slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I 
have not strawed:<BR>[<B>27</B>] Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to 
the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with 
usury.<BR>[<B>28</B>] Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him 
which hath ten talents.<BR>[<B>29</B>] For unto every one that hath shall be 
given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken 
away even that which he hath.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And cast ye the unprofitable 
servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth.<BR>[<B>31</B>] When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the 
holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his 
glory:<BR>[<B>32</B>] And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall 
separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the 
goats:<BR>[<B>33</B>] And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the 
goats on the left.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Then shall the King say unto them on his right 
hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from 
the foundation of the world:<BR>[<B>35</B>] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me 
meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me 
in:<BR>[<B>36</B>] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I 
was in prison, and ye came unto me.<BR>[<B>37</B>] Then shall the righteous 
answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, 
and gave thee drink?<BR>[<B>38</B>] When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee 
in? or naked, and clothed thee?<BR>[<B>39</B>] Or when saw we thee sick, or in 
prison, and came unto thee?<BR>[<B>40</B>] And the King shall answer and say 
unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the 
least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<BR>[<B>41</B>] Then shall 
he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into 
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:<BR>[<B>42</B>] For I 
was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no 
drink:<BR>[<B>43</B>] I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye 
clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.<BR>[<B>44</B>] Then 
shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or 
athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister 
unto thee?<BR>[<B>45</B>] Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto 
you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to 
me.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the 
righteous into life eternal.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.26</H3>[<B>1</B>] And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all 
these sayings, he said unto his disciples,<BR>[<B>2</B>] Ye know that after two 
days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be 
crucified.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Then assembled together the chief priests, and the 
scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who 
was called Caiaphas,<BR>[<B>4</B>] And consulted that they might take Jesus by 
subtilty, and kill him.<BR>[<B>5</B>] But they said, Not on the feast day, lest 
there be an uproar among the people.<BR>[<B>6</B>] Now when Jesus was in 
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,<BR>[<B>7</B>] There came unto him a 
woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his 
head, as he sat at meat.<BR>[<B>8</B>] But when his disciples saw it, they had 
indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?<BR>[<B>9</B>] For this 
ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.<BR>[<B>10</B>] 
When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she 
hath wrought a good work upon me.<BR>[<B>11</B>] For ye have the poor always 
with you; but me ye have not always.<BR>[<B>12</B>] For in that she hath poured 
this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Verily I say 
unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there 
shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of 
her.<BR>[<B>14</B>] Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the 
chief priests,<BR>[<B>15</B>] And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I 
will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of 
silver.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And from that time he sought opportunity to betray 
him.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the 
disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for 
thee to eat the passover?<BR>[<B>18</B>] And he said, Go into the city to such a 
man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the 
passover at thy house with my disciples.<BR>[<B>19</B>] And the disciples did as 
Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.<BR>[<B>20</B>] Now 
when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.<BR>[<B>21</B>] And as they 
did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray 
me.<BR>[<B>22</B>] And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of 
them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?<BR>[<B>23</B>] And he answered and said, He 
that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray 
me.<BR>[<B>24</B>] The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto 
that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he 
had not been born.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and 
said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.<BR>[<B>26</B>] And as 
they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to 
the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<BR>[<B>27</B>] And he took 
the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of 
it;<BR>[<B>28</B>] For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for 
many for the remission of sins.<BR>[<B>29</B>] But I say unto you, I will not 
drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new 
with you in my Father's kingdom.<BR>[<B>30</B>] And when they had sung an hymn, 
they went out into the mount of Olives.<BR>[<B>31</B>] Then saith Jesus unto 
them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I 
will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered 
abroad.<BR>[<B>32</B>] But after I am risen again, I will go before you into 
Galilee.<BR>[<B>33</B>] Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall 
be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.<BR>[<B>34</B>] Jesus 
said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, 
thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>[<B>35</B>] Peter said unto him, Though I should 
die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the 
disciples.<BR>[<B>36</B>] Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called 
Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray 
yonder.<BR>[<B>37</B>] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, 
and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Then saith he unto 
them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch 
with me.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and 
prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: 
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.<BR>[<B>40</B>] And he cometh unto 
the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not 
watch with me one hour?<BR>[<B>41</B>] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into 
temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<BR>[<B>42</B>] 
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup 
may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.<BR>[<B>43</B>] 
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were 
heavy.<BR>[<B>44</B>] And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the 
third time, saying the same words.<BR>[<B>45</B>] Then cometh he to his 
disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the 
hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of 
sinners.<BR>[<B>46</B>] Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth 
betray me.<BR>[<B>47</B>] And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, 
came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief 
priests and elders of the people.<BR>[<B>48</B>] Now he that betrayed him gave 
them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him 
fast.<BR>[<B>49</B>] And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and 
kissed him.<BR>[<B>50</B>] And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou 
come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And, 
behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his 
sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his 
ear.<BR>[<B>52</B>] Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his 
place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the 
sword.<BR>[<B>53</B>] Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he 
shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<BR>[<B>54</B>] But 
how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<BR>[<B>55</B>] 
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a 
thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in 
the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.<BR>[<B>56</B>] But all this was done, 
that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples 
forsook him, and fled.<BR>[<B>57</B>] And they that had laid hold on Jesus led 
him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were 
assembled.<BR>[<B>58</B>] But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's 
palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<BR>[<B>59</B>] 
Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness 
against Jesus, to put him to death;<BR>[<B>60</B>] But found none: yea, though 
many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false 
witnesses,<BR>[<B>61</B>] And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the 
temple of God, and to build it in three days.<BR>[<B>62</B>] And the high priest 
arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness 
against thee?<BR>[<B>63</B>] But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest 
answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us 
whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.<BR>[<B>64</B>] Jesus saith unto him, 
Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of 
man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of 
heaven.<BR>[<B>65</B>] Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath 
spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have 
heard his blasphemy.<BR>[<B>66</B>] What think ye? They answered and said, He is 
guilty of death.<BR>[<B>67</B>] Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted 
him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,<BR>[<B>68</B>] Saying, 
Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?<BR>[<B>69</B>] Now 
Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also 
wast with Jesus of Galilee.<BR>[<B>70</B>] But he denied before them all, 
saying, I know not what thou sayest.<BR>[<B>71</B>] And when he was gone out 
into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This 
fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.<BR>[<B>72</B>] And again he denied with 
an oath, I do not know the man.<BR>[<B>73</B>] And after a while came unto him 
they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy 
speech bewrayeth thee.<BR>[<B>74</B>] Then began he to curse and to swear, 
saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<BR>[<B>75</B>] And 
Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, 
thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.27</H3>[<B>1</B>] When the morning was come, all the chief priests and 
elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to 
death:<BR>[<B>2</B>] And when they had bound him, they led him away, and 
delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.<BR>[<B>3</B>] Then Judas, which 
had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and 
brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and 
elders,<BR>[<B>4</B>] Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent 
blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And he 
cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged 
himself.<BR>[<B>6</B>] And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, 
It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of 
blood.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's 
field, to bury strangers in.<BR>[<B>8</B>] Wherefore that field was called, The 
field of blood, unto this day.<BR>[<B>9</B>] Then was fulfilled that which was 
spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, 
the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did 
value;<BR>[<B>10</B>] And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord 
appointed me.<BR>[<B>11</B>] And Jesus stood before the governor: and the 
governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto 
him, Thou sayest.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when he was accused of the chief priests 
and elders, he answered nothing.<BR>[<B>13</B>] Then said Pilate unto him, 
Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?<BR>[<B>14</B>] And 
he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled 
greatly.<BR>[<B>15</B>] Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto 
the people a prisoner, whom they would.<BR>[<B>16</B>] And they had then a 
notable prisoner, called Barabbas.<BR>[<B>17</B>] Therefore when they were 
gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? 
Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?<BR>[<B>18</B>] For he knew that for 
envy they had delivered him.<BR>[<B>19</B>] When he was set down on the judgment 
seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just 
man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of 
him.<BR>[<B>20</B>] But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude 
that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.<BR>[<B>21</B>] The governor 
answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto 
you? They said, Barabbas.<BR>[<B>22</B>] Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do 
then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be 
crucified.<BR>[<B>23</B>] And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? 
But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.<BR>[<B>24</B>] When 
Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he 
took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of 
the blood of this just person: see ye to it.<BR>[<B>25</B>] Then answered all 
the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.<BR>[<B>26</B>] 
Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he 
delivered him to be crucified.<BR>[<B>27</B>] Then the soldiers of the governor 
took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of 
soldiers.<BR>[<B>28</B>] And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet 
robe.<BR>[<B>29</B>] And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it 
upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, 
and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!<BR>[<B>30</B>] And they spit 
upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.<BR>[<B>31</B>] And after 
that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own 
raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.<BR>[<B>32</B>] And as they came 
out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his 
cross.<BR>[<B>33</B>] And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that 
is to say, a place of a skull,<BR>[<B>34</B>] They gave him vinegar to drink 
mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not 
drink.<BR>[<B>35</B>] And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting 
lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my 
garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.<BR>[<B>36</B>] And 
sitting down they watched him there;<BR>[<B>37</B>] And set up over his head his 
accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<BR>[<B>38</B>] Then were 
there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the 
left.<BR>[<B>39</B>] And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their 
heads,<BR>[<B>40</B>] And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest 
it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the 
cross.<BR>[<B>41</B>] Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the 
scribes and elders, said,<BR>[<B>42</B>] He saved others; himself he cannot 
save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we 
will believe him.<BR>[<B>43</B>] He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if 
he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.<BR>[<B>44</B>] The thieves 
also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.<BR>[<B>45</B>] 
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth 
hour.<BR>[<B>46</B>] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast 
thou forsaken me?<BR>[<B>47</B>] Some of them that stood there, when they heard 
that, said, This man calleth for Elias.<BR>[<B>48</B>] And straightway one of 
them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, 
and gave him to drink.<BR>[<B>49</B>] The rest said, Let be, let us see whether 
Elias will come to save him.<BR>[<B>50</B>] Jesus, when he had cried again with 
a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.<BR>[<B>51</B>] And, behold, the veil of the 
temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, 
and the rocks rent;<BR>[<B>52</B>] And the graves were opened; and many bodies 
of the saints which slept arose,<BR>[<B>53</B>] And came out of the graves after 
his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto 
many.<BR>[<B>54</B>] Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, 
watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared 
greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.<BR>[<B>55</B>] And many women 
were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering 
unto him:<BR>[<B>56</B>] Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of 
James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.<BR>[<B>57</B>] When the 
even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also 
himself was Jesus' disciple:<BR>[<B>58</B>] He went to Pilate, and begged the 
body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.<BR>[<B>59</B>] 
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen 
cloth,<BR>[<B>60</B>] And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in 
the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and 
departed.<BR>[<B>61</B>] And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, 
sitting over against the sepulchre.<BR>[<B>62</B>] Now the next day, that 
followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came 
together unto Pilate,<BR>[<B>63</B>] Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver 
said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.<BR>[<B>64</B>] 
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his 
disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is 
risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the 
first.<BR>[<B>65</B>] Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make 
it as sure as ye can.<BR>[<B>66</B>] So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, 
sealing the stone, and setting a watch.<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Matt.28</H3>[<B>1</B>] In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward 
the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the 
sepulchre.<BR>[<B>2</B>] And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the 
angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from 
the door, and sat upon it.<BR>[<B>3</B>] His countenance was like lightning, and 
his raiment white as snow:<BR>[<B>4</B>] And for fear of him the keepers did 
shake, and became as dead men.<BR>[<B>5</B>] And the angel answered and said 
unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was 
crucified.<BR>[<B>6</B>] He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see 
the place where the Lord lay.<BR>[<B>7</B>] And go quickly, and tell his 
disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into 
Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.<BR>[<B>8</B>] And they 
departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to 
bring his disciples word.<BR>[<B>9</B>] And as they went to tell his disciples, 
behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the 
feet, and worshipped him.<BR>[<B>10</B>] Then said Jesus unto them, Be not 
afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see 
me.<BR>[<B>11</B>] Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into 
the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were 
done.<BR>[<B>12</B>] And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken 
counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,<BR>[<B>13</B>] Saying, Say ye, 
His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.<BR>[<B>14</B>] 
And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure 
you.<BR>[<B>15</B>] So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and 
this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.<BR>[<B>16</B>] 
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus 
had appointed them.<BR>[<B>17</B>] And when they saw him, they worshipped him: 
but some doubted.<BR>[<B>18</B>] And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All 
power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<BR>[<B>19</B>] Go ye therefore, 
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost:<BR>[<B>20</B>] Teaching them to observe all things 
whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end 
of the world. Amen.<BR>
