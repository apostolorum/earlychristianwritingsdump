Christ. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So all the generations from Abraham to 
David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen 
generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen 
generations. 
<P><A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like 
this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came 
together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. <A name=C1V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Joseph, her 
husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, 
intended to put her away secretly. <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he thought about these things, 
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of 
David, don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She shall bring forth a son. You shall 
call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins." 
<P><A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now all this has happened, that it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Behold, the virgin shall be with 
child,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shall bring forth a son. 
<P>&nbsp;They shall call his name 
Immanuel;"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is, being interpreted, 
"God with us." 
<P><A name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as 
the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; <A 
name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and didn't know her sexually until she 
had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him Jesus. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of 
Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Matthew.htm#N3">wise men</A> from the east 
came to Jerusalem, saying, <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Where is he who is born King of the 
Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him." <A 
name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When 
Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <A 
name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Gathering together all the chief priests 
and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. <A 
name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They 
said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet, 

<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>'You Bethlehem, land of 
Judah,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are in no way least among the 
princes of Judah: 
<P>&nbsp;For out of you shall come forth a 
governor,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall shepherd my people, 
Israel.'" 
<P><A name=C2V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Herod secretly called the wise men, 
and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared. <A name=C2V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He sent them to 
Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you 
have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him." 
<P><A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They, having heard the king, went their 
way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until 
it came and stood over where the young child was. <A name=C2V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they saw the 
star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. <A name=C2V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They came into the 
house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and 
worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, 
frankincense, and myrrh. <A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being warned in a dream that they 
shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. 
<P><A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when they had departed, behold, an 
angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the 
young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell 
you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him." 
<P><A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He arose and took the young child and 
his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, <A name=C2V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and was there until 
the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord 
through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son." 
<P><A name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Herod, when he saw that he was 
mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the 
male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from 
two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from 
the wise men. <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah 
the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"A voice was heard in 
Ramah,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamentation, weeping and great 
mourning, 
<P>&nbsp;Rachel weeping for her 
children;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wouldn't be 
comforted,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are no more." 
<P><A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when Herod was dead, behold, an 
angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, <A 
name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Arise and take the young child and his 
mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's 
life are dead." 
<P><A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He arose and took the young child and 
his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <A name=C2V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he heard 
that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was 
afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of 
Galilee, <A name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and came and lived in a city called 
Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "He 
will be called a Nazarene." 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In those days, John the Baptizer came, 
preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <A name=C3V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Repent, for the 
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!" <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this is he who was spoken of by 
Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;"The voice of one crying in the 
wilderness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make ready the way of the 
Lord,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make his paths straight." 
<P><A name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now John himself wore clothing made of 
camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and 
wild honey. <A name=C3V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then people from Jerusalem, all of 
Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. <A name=C3V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were baptized 
by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. <A name=C3V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But when he saw many 
of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "You 
offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <A 
name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of 
repentance! <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't think to yourselves, 'We have 
Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to 
Abraham from these stones. 
<P><A name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Even now the axe lies at the root of 
the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut 
down, and cast into the fire. <A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I indeed baptize you in water for 
repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not 
worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP><A

<A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and 
he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into 
the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire." 
<P><A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the 
Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But John would have hindered him, 
saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?" 
<P><A name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus, answering, said to him, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill 
all righteousness."</FONT> Then he allowed him. <A name=C3V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus, when he was 
baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened 
to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. <A 
name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, a voice out of the heavens 
said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." 
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into 
the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <A name=C4V2><FONT

<P><A name=C26V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

all these words, that he said to his disciples, <A name=C26V2><FONT

color=#ff0000>"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son

<P><A name=C26V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the chief priests, the scribes,

priest, who was called Caiaphas. <A name=C26V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They took counsel together that they 
might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him. <A name=C26V5><FONT

during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people." 
<P><A name=C26V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the 
house of Simon the leper, <A name=C26V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>a woman came to him having an alabaster

table. <A name=C26V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

were indignant, saying, "Why this waste? <A name=C26V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

for much, and given to the poor." 
<P><A name=C26V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<FONT color=#ff0000>"Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good 
work for me. </FONT><A name=C26V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, <A name=C26V15><FONT

are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?" They weighed out 
for him thirty pieces of silver. <A name=C26V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Jesus came with them to a place 
called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Sit here, 
while I go there and pray."</FONT> <A name=C26V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He took with him Peter and the two 
sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled. <A

watch with me."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C26V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

desire."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C26V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V47><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and 
clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people. <A name=C26V48><FONT

him." <A name=C26V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him. 
<P><A name=C26V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

on Jesus, and took him. <A name=C26V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the 
high priest, and struck off his ear. <A name=C26V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:52</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Jesus said to him, <FONT

<P><A name=C26V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

multitudes, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Have you come out as against a robber with 
swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't 
arrest me. </FONT><A name=C26V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>Then all the disciples left him, and fled. <A name=C26V57><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Those who had 
taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the 
elders were gathered together. <A name=C26V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Peter followed him from a 
distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the 
officers, to see the end. <A name=C26V59><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests, the elders, and 
the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him 
to death; <A name=C26V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they found none. Even though many 
false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses 
came forward, <A name=C26V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said, "This man said, 'I am able 
to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'" 
<P><A name=C26V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The high priest stood up, and said to 
him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?" <A

size=-1><SUP>26:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus held his peace. The high 
priest answered him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether 
you are the Christ, the Son of God." 
<P><A name=C26V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, henceforth you will 
see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds 
of the sky."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C26V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the high priest tore his 
clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? 
Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <A name=C26V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What do you 
think?" 
<P>They answered, "He is worthy of death!" <A name=C26V67><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>26:67</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then they spit in 
his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <A

Who hit you?" 
<P><A name=C26V69><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!" 

<P><A name=C26V70><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he denied it before them all, 
saying, "I don't know what you are talking about." 
<P><A name=C26V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had gone out onto the porch, 
someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, "This man also was with 
Jesus of Nazareth." 
<P><A name=C26V72><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C26V73><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:73</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>After a little while those who stood 
by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech 
makes you known." 
<P><A name=C26V74><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:74</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then he began to curse and to swear, 
"I don't know the man!" 
<P>Immediately the rooster crowed. <A name=C26V75><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>26:75</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Peter remembered the word which Jesus 
had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He 
went out and wept bitterly. 
<P><A name=C27V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when morning had come, all the 
chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him 
to death: <A name=C27V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they bound him, and led him away, 
and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. <A name=C27V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Judas, who 
betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought 
back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <A 
name=C27V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "I have sinned in that I 
betrayed innocent blood." 
<P>But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it." 
<P><A name=C27V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He threw down the pieces of silver in 
the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself. <A 
name=C27V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests took the pieces of 
silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is 
the price of blood." <A name=C27V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They took counsel, and bought the 
potter's field with them, to bury strangers in. <A name=C27V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore that 
field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day. <A name=C27V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then that which was 
spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
<P>&nbsp;"They took the thirty pieces of 
silver,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of him upon whom a 
price had been set,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom some of the

<P>&nbsp;<A name=C27V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C27V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Jesus stood before the governor: 
and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" 
<P>Jesus said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"So you say."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C27V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he was accused by the chief 
priests and elders, he answered nothing. <A name=C27V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Pilate said 
to him, "Don't you hear how many things they testify against you?" 
<P><A name=C27V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He gave him no answer, not even one 
word, so that the governor marveled greatly. <A name=C27V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now at the feast 
the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they 
desired. <A name=C27V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They had then a notable prisoner, 
called Barabbas. <A name=C27V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When therefore they were gathered 
together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, 
or Jesus, who is called Christ?" <A name=C27V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he knew that because of envy they 
had delivered him up. 
<P><A name=C27V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While he was sitting on the judgment 
seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, 
for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him." <A 
name=C27V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the chief priests and the elders 
persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. <A 
name=C27V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the governor answered them, "Which

<P>They said, "Barabbas!" 
<P><A name=C27V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?" 
<P>They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!" 
<P><A name=C27V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!" 
<P><A name=C27V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and 
washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of 
this righteous person. You see to it." 
<P><A name=C27V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

blood be on us, and on our children!" 
<P><A name=C27V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. <A name=C27V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then the 
governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole 
garrison together against him. <A name=C27V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

robe on him. <A name=C27V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, 
and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" <A name=C27V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They spat on him,

him away to crucify him. 
<P><A name=C27V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

carry his cross. <A name=C27V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C27V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, 
come down from the cross!" 
<P><A name=C27V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

mocking, with the scribes, <A

the elders, said, <A name=C27V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach. 
<P><A name=C27V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C27V48><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:48</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately one of them ran, and took 
a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a

whether Elijah comes to save him." 
<P><A name=C27V50><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and yielded up his spirit. <A name=C27V51><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:51</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, the veil of the temple was 
torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were 
split. <A name=C27V52><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared 
to many. <A name=C27V54><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:54</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the centurion, and those who were 
with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were 
done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God." 
<P><A name=C27V55><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:55</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Many women were there watching from 
afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. <A name=C27V56><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:56</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Among them were 
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons 
of Zebedee. <A name=C27V57><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:57</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When evening had come, a rich man from 
Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came. <A 
name=C27V58><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:58</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This man went to Pilate, and asked for 
Jesus' body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. <A name=C27V59><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:59</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Joseph took the 
body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <A name=C27V60><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:60</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and laid it in his 
own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to 
the door of the tomb, and departed. <A name=C27V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:61</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Mary Magdalene was there, and the 
other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <A name=C27V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now on the next day, which was the day 
after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered 
together to Pilate, <A name=C27V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "Sir, we remember what that 
deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.' <A 
name=C27V64><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Command therefore that the tomb be 
made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and 
steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last 
deception will be worse than the first." 
<P><A name=C27V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>27:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate said to them, "You have a 
guard. Go, make it as secure as you can." <A name=C27V66><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>27:66</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they went with 
the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. 
<P><A name=C28V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to 
dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see 
the tomb. <A name=C28V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, there was a great earthquake, 
for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the 
stone from the door, and sat on it. <A name=C28V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His appearance was like lightning, and 
his clothing white as snow. <A name=C28V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For fear of him, the guards shook, and 
became like dead men. <A name=C28V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The angel answered the women, "Don't be 
afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. <A 
name=C28V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the 
Lord was lying. <A name=C28V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He 
has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you 
will see him.' Behold, I have told you." 
<P><A name=C28V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They departed quickly from the tomb 
with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. <A 
name=C28V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Rejoice!"</FONT> 
<P>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. 
<P><A name=C28V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then Jesus said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Don't be afraid. Go tell my <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Matthew.htm#N48">brothers</A> that they 
should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C28V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now while they were going, behold, 
some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things 
that had happened. <A name=C28V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they were assembled with the 
elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the 
soldiers, <A name=C28V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "Say that his disciples came 
by night, and stole him away while we slept. <A name=C28V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>28:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If this comes to 
the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry." <A

size=-1><SUP>28:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So they took the money and did as they 
were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until 
this day. 
<P><A name=C28V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>28:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the eleven disciples went into 
Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. <A name=C28V17><FONT

they bowed down to him, but some doubted. <A name=C28V18><FONT
