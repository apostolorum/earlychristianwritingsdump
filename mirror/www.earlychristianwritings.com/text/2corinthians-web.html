<H1>2 Corinthians. Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians </H1>
<P>
<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through 
the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at 
Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia: <A name=C1V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Grace to you and 
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<P><A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Blessed be the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort; <A 
name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who 
comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are 
in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by 
God. <A name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For as the sufferings of Christ abound 
to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ. <A name=C1V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if we are 
afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for 
your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings 
which we also suffer. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing 
that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort. 
<A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we don't desire to have you 
uninformed, <A href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/2Cor.htm#N1">brothers,</A> 
concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed 
down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life. <A 
name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yes, 
we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not 
trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead, <A name=C1V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who delivered us 
out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he 
will also still deliver us; <A name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>you also helping together on our behalf 
by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks 
may be given by many persons on your behalf. <A name=C1V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For our boasting is 
this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, 
not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, 
and more abundantly toward you. <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we write no other things to you, 
than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the 
end; <A name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>as also you acknowledged us in part, 
that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord 
Jesus. <A name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In this confidence, I was determined to 
come first to you, that you might have a second benefit; <A name=C1V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and by you to pass 
into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward 
by you on my journey to Judea. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I therefore was thus determined, 
did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to 
the flesh, that with me there should be the "Yes, yes" and the "No, no?" <A 
name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But as God is faithful, our word toward 
you was not "Yes and no." <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who 
was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and 
no," but in him is "Yes." <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For however many are the promises of 
God, in him is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory 
of God through us. 
<P><A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he who establishes us with you in 
Christ, and anointed us, is God; <A name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who also sealed us, and gave us the 
down payment of the Spirit in our hearts. <A name=C1V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I call God for 
a witness to my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you. <A 
name=C1V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not that we have lordship over your 
faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in 
faith. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I determined this for myself, that I 
would not come to you again in sorrow. <A name=C2V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if I make you sorry, then who will 
make me glad but he who is made sorry by me? <A name=C2V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And I wrote this 
very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of 
whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be 
shared by all of you. <A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For out of much affliction and anguish 
of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but 
that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you. <A 
name=C2V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I 
not press too heavily) to you all. <A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Sufficient to such a one is this 
punishment which was inflicted by the many; <A name=C2V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so that on the 
contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a 
one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow. <A name=C2V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore I beg you 
to confirm your love toward him. <A name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For to this end I also wrote, that I 
might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things. <A 
name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I also forgive whomever you forgive 
anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for 
your sakes in the presence of Christ, <A name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that no advantage may be gained over us 
by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes. 
<P><A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when I came to Troas for the Gospel 
of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord, <A name=C2V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I had no relief for 
my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, 
I went out into Macedonia. <A name=C2V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now thanks be to God, who always leads 
us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge 
in every place. <A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to 
God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish; <A name=C2V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>to the one a stench 
from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is 
sufficient for these things? <A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we are not as so many, peddling the 
word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak 
in Christ. 
<P><A name=C3V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Are we beginning again to commend 
ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from 
you? <A name=C3V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You are our letter, written in our 
hearts, known and read by all men; <A name=C3V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>being revealed that you are a letter of 
Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the 
living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh. <A 
name=C3V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Such 
confidence we have through Christ toward God; <A name=C3V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>not that we are 
sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our 
sufficiency is from God; <A name=C3V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>who also made us sufficient as servants 
of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, 
but the Spirit gives life. <A name=C3V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But if the service of death, written 
engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not 
look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was 
passing away: <A name=C3V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>won't service of the Spirit be with much 
more glory? <A name=C3V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the service of condemnation has 
glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory. <A 
name=C3V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For most assuredly that which has been 
made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory 
that surpasses. <A name=C3V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if that which passes away was with 
glory, much more that which remains is in glory. 
<P><A name=C3V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having therefore such a hope, we use 
great boldness of speech, <A name=C3V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and not as Moses, who put a veil on his 
face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that 
which was passing away. <A name=C3V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But their minds were hardened, for 
until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, 
because in Christ it passes away. <A name=C3V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But to this day, when Moses is read, a 
veil lies on their heart. <A name=C3V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But whenever one turns to the Lord, the 
veil is taken away. <A name=C3V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>3:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the Lord is the Spirit and where 
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. <A name=C3V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>3:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we all, with 
unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed 
into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit. 
<P><A name=C4V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, 
even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint. <A name=C4V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we have 
renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling 
the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending 
ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. <A name=C4V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Even if our Gospel 
is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish; <A name=C4V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>4:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in whom the god of 
this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the 
Gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them. 
<A name=C4V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we don't preach ourselves, but 
Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake; <A 
name=C4V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>seeing it is God who said, "Light will 
shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the 
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
<P><A name=C4V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we have this treasure in clay 
vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from 
ourselves. <A name=C4V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We are pressed on every side, yet not 
crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair; <A name=C4V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, 
yet not destroyed; <A name=C4V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>always carrying in the body the putting 
to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our 
body. <A name=C4V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we who live are always delivered to 
death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal 
flesh. <A name=C4V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So then death works in us, but life in 
you. <A name=C4V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But having the same spirit of faith, 
according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke." We also 
believe, and therefore also we speak; <A name=C4V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>knowing that he who raised the Lord 
Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you. <A 
name=C4V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For all things are for your sakes, that 
the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to 
abound to the glory of God. <A name=C4V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore we don't faint, but though 
our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. <A 
name=C4V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For our light affliction, which is for 
the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; 
<A name=C4V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>4:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while we don't look at the things which 
are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen 
are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. 
<P><A name=C5V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we know that if the earthly house of 
our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, 
eternal, in the heavens. <A name=C5V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For most assuredly in this we groan, 
longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven; <A 
name=C5V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>if 
so be that being clothed we will not be found naked. <A name=C5V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For indeed we who 
are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, 
but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by 
life. <A name=C5V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now he who made us for this very thing 
is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit. 
<P><A name=C5V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being therefore always of good courage, 
and knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord; 
<A name=C5V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for we walk by faith, not by sight. <A 
name=C5V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We 
are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, 
and to be at home with the Lord. <A name=C5V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore also we make it our aim, 
whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him. <A name=C5V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we must all be 
revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the 
things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. <A 
name=C5V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, 
we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed 
also in your consciences. <A name=C5V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we are not commending ourselves to 
you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you 
may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart. <A 
name=C5V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if we are beside ourselves, it is 
for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you. <A name=C5V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For the love of 
Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore 
all died. <A name=C5V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He died for all, that those who live 
should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and 
rose again. <A name=C5V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore we know no one after the 
flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we 
know him so no more. <A name=C5V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is 
a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become 
new. <A name=C5V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But all things are of God, who 
reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of 
reconciliation; <A name=C5V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>namely, that God was in Christ 
reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and 
having committed to us the word of reconciliation. <A name=C5V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We are therefore 
ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us. We beg you 
on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. <A name=C5V21><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For him who knew no 
sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the 
righteousness of God. 
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Working together, we entreat also that 
you not receive the grace of God in vain, <A name=C6V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for he says, 
<P>&nbsp;"At an acceptable time I listened to you, 
<P>&nbsp;In a day of salvation I helped you." 
<P>Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. <A 
name=C6V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We 
give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed, 
<A name=C6V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but in everything commending ourselves, 
as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in 
distresses, <A name=C6V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, 
in labors, in watchings, in fastings; <A name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, 
in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love, <A name=C6V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in the word of 
truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and 
on the left, <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>by glory and dishonor, by evil report 
and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; <A name=C6V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>as unknown, and yet 
well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed; <A 
name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>as 
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having 
nothing, and yet possessing all things. 
<P><A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. 
Our heart is enlarged. <A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You are not restricted by us, but you 
are restricted by your own affections. <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now in return, I speak as to my 
children, you also be open wide. <A name=C6V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Don't be unequally yoked with 
unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what 
communion has light with darkness? <A name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What agreement has Christ with Belial? 
Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever? <A name=C6V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>What agreement has 
a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God 
said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they 
will be my people." <A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore, 
<P>&nbsp;"'Come out from among them,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
be separate,' says the Lord, 
<P>&nbsp;'Touch no unclean thing.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will 
receive you. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C6V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will be to you a 
Father.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be to me sons and 
daughters,' 
<P>says the Lord Almighty." 
<P><A name=C7V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having therefore these promises, 
beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, 
perfecting holiness in the fear of God. <A name=C7V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Open your hearts to us. We wronged no 
one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one. <A name=C7V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say this not to 
condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together 
and live together. <A name=C7V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Great is my boldness of speech toward 
you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow 
with joy in all our affliction. <A name=C7V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For even when we had come into 
Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. 
Fightings were outside. Fear was inside. <A name=C7V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, 
God, comforted us by the coming of Titus; <A name=C7V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and not by his coming only, but also by 
the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your 
longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more. 
<P><A name=C7V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though I made you sorry with my 
letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter 
made you sorry, though just for a while. <A name=C7V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I now rejoice, not that you were made 
sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a 
godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing. <A name=C7V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For godly sorrow 
works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the 
world works death. <A name=C7V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For behold, this same thing, that you 
were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what 
defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you 
demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter. <A name=C7V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>7:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So although I wrote 
to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that 
suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you 
in the sight of God. <A name=C7V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore we have been comforted. In 
our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his 
spirit has been refreshed by you all. <A name=C7V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if in anything I have boasted to 
him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in 
truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth. <A 
name=C7V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His affection is more abundantly toward 
you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you 
received him. <A name=C7V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I rejoice that in everything I am of 
good courage concerning you. 
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Moreover, brothers, we make known to you 
the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia; <A 
name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how 
that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep 
poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. <A name=C8V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For according to 
their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own 
accord, <A name=C8V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>begging us with much entreaty to receive 
this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints. <A name=C8V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This was not as we 
had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through 
the will of God. <A name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>So we urged Titus, that as he made a 
beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace. <A 
name=C8V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, 
and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace. <A 
name=C8V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of 
others the sincerity also of your love. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you 
through his poverty might become rich. <A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I give a judgment in this: for this is 
expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but 
also to be willing. <A name=C8V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But now complete the doing also, that 
as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also 
out of your ability. <A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if the readiness is there, it is 
acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't have. <A 
name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this is not that others may be 
eased and you distressed, <A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but for equality. Your abundance at 
this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a 
supply for your lack; that there may be equality. <A name=C8V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As it is written, 
"He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no 
lack." 
<P><A name=C8V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But thanks be to God, who puts the same 
earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. <A name=C8V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he indeed 
accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of 
his own accord. <A name=C8V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We have sent together with him the 
brother whose praise in the Gospel is known through all the assemblies. <A 
name=C8V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Not only so, but who was also appointed 
by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the 
glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness. <A name=C8V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We are avoiding 
this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is 
administered by us. <A name=C8V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>8:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Having regard for honorable things, not 
only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. <A name=C8V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>We have sent with 
them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now 
much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you. <A 
name=C8V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As 
for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they 
are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ. <A name=C8V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore show the 
proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on 
your behalf. 
<P><A name=C9V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is indeed unnecessary for me to write 
to you concerning the service to the saints, <A name=C9V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for I know your 
readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has 
been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them. <A 
name=C9V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But 
I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in 
this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared, <A name=C9V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so that I won't by 
any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we 
(to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting. <A 
name=C9V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before 
to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, 
that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness. 
<A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Remember this: he who sows sparingly 
will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. <A 
name=C9V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let 
each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or 
under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver. <A name=C9V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And God is able to 
make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in 
everything, may abound to every good work. <A name=C9V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As it is written, 
<P>&nbsp;"He has scattered abroad, he has given to the 
poor.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His righteousness remains forever." 

<P><A name=C9V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now may he who supplies seed to the 
sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase 
the fruits of your righteousness; <A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>you being enriched in everything to all 
liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God. <A name=C9V12><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this service of 
giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds 
also through many givings of thanks to God; <A name=C9V13><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>9:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>seeing that through 
the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your 
confession to the Gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution 
to them and to all; <A name=C9V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>while they themselves also, with 
supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of 
God in you. <A name=C9V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now thanks be to God for his 
unspeakable gift! 
<P><A name=C10V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the 
humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, 
but being absent am of good courage toward you. <A name=C10V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Yes, I beg you that 
I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to 
be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh. <A 
name=C10V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though we walk in the flesh, we 
don't wage war according to the flesh; <A name=C10V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for the weapons of our warfare are not 
of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds, <A 
name=C10V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>throwing down imaginations and every 
high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every 
thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ; <A name=C10V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and being in 
readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full. <A 
name=C10V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Do 
you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts 
in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, 
even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's. <A name=C10V8><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For though I should 
boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for 
building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed, <A 
name=C10V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that I may not seem as if I desire to 
terrify you by my letters. <A name=C10V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For, "His letters," they say, "are 
weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is 
despised." <A name=C10V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Let such a person consider this, that 
what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when 
we are present. <A name=C10V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we are not bold to number or 
compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they 
themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with 
themselves, are without understanding. <A name=C10V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But we will not boast beyond proper 
limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach 
even to you. <A name=C10V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we don't stretch ourselves too 
much, as though we didn't reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with 
the Gospel of Christ, <A name=C10V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>not boasting beyond proper limits in 
other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be 
abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence, <A name=C10V16><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>10:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>so as to preach 
the Gospel even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has 
already done. <A name=C10V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But "he who boasts, let him boast in 
the Lord." <A name=C10V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>10:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For it isn't he who commends himself 
who is approved, but whom the Lord commends. 
<P><A name=C11V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I wish that you would bear with me in a 
little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me. <A name=C11V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I am jealous 
over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might 
present you as a pure virgin to Christ. <A name=C11V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I am afraid that somehow, as the 
serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from 
the simplicity that is in Christ. <A name=C11V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if he who comes preaches another 
Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you 
did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you put up 
with that well enough. <A name=C11V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I reckon that I am not at all 
behind the very best apostles. <A name=C11V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But though I am unskilled in speech, 
yet I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way we have been revealed to 
you in all things. <A name=C11V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Or did I commit a sin in humbling 
myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Gospel free of 
charge? <A name=C11V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I robbed other assemblies, taking wages 
from them that I might serve you. <A name=C11V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When I was present with you and was in 
need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from 
Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from 
being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so. <A name=C11V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As the truth of 
Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of 
Achaia. <A name=C11V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Why? Because I don't love you? God 
knows. <A name=C11V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But what I do, that I will do, that I 
may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they 
boast, they may be found even as we. <A name=C11V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For such men are false apostles, 
deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles. <A name=C11V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>And no wonder, for 
even Satan masquerades as an angel of light. <A name=C11V15><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is no great 
thing therefore if his ministers also masquerade as servants of righteousness, 
whose end will be according to their works. 
<P><A name=C11V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I say again, let no one think me 
foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little. 
<A name=C11V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>That which I speak, I don't speak 
according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting. <A 
name=C11V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Seeing that many boast after the 
flesh, I will also boast. <A name=C11V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you bear with the foolish gladly, 
being wise. <A name=C11V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For you bear with a man, if he brings 
you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts 
himself, if he strikes you on the face. <A name=C11V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I speak by way of disparagement, as 
though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am 
bold also. <A name=C11V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they 
Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I. <A name=C11V23><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Are they servants 
of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more 
abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths 
often. <A name=C11V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Five times from the Jews I received 
forty stripes minus one. <A name=C11V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Three times I was beaten with rods. 
Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a 
day in the deep. <A name=C11V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I have been in travels often, perils 
of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the 
Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, 
perils among false brothers; <A name=C11V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>in labor and travail, in watchings 
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness. 
<P><A name=C11V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Besides those things that are outside, 
there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies. <A 
name=C11V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is 
caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation? <A name=C11V30><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>If I must boast, I 
will boast of the things that concern my weakness. <A name=C11V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>11:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The God and Father 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie. 
<A name=C11V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>In Damascus the governor under Aretas 
the king guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me. <A 
name=C11V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>11:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Through a window I was let down in a 
basket by the wall, and escaped his hands. 
<P><A name=C12V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It is doubtless not profitable for me 
to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. <A 
name=C12V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or 
whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the 
third heaven. <A name=C12V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I know such a man (whether in the body, 
or outside of the body, I don't know; God knows), <A name=C12V4><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>how he was caught 
up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man 
to utter. <A name=C12V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>On behalf of such a one I will boast, 
but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. <A 
name=C12V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For if I would desire to boast, I will 
not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, so that no man may 
account of me above that which he sees in me, or hears from me. <A 
name=C12V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>By 
reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be 
exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of 
Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted excessively. <A 
name=C12V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Concerning this thing, I begged the 
Lord three times that it might depart from me. <A name=C12V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He has said to me, 
"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Most 
gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ 
may rest on me. 
<P><A name=C12V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Therefore I take pleasure in 
weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for 
Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. <A name=C12V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I have become 
foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by 
you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am 
nothing. <A name=C12V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Truly the signs of an apostle were 
worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works. <A 
name=C12V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For what is there in which you were 
made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not 
a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong. 
<P><A name=C12V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Behold, this is the third time I am 
ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your 
possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but 
the parents for the children. <A name=C12V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I will most gladly spend and be spent 
for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? <A 
name=C12V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But be it so, I did not myself burden 
you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception. <A name=C12V17><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Did I take 
advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you? <A name=C12V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I exhorted Titus, 
and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn't we 
walk in the same spirit? Didn't we walk in the same steps? <A name=C12V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Again, do you 
think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in 
Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying. <A name=C12V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>12:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For I am afraid 
that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that 
I might be found by you as you don't desire; that by any means there would be 
strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud 
thoughts, riots; <A name=C12V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>12:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>that again when I come my God would 
humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before 
now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness 
which they committed. 
<P><A name=C13V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>This is the third time I am coming to 
you. "At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word established." <A 
name=C13V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I 
have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second 
time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to 
all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare; <A name=C13V3><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>seeing that you 
seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is 
powerful in you. <A name=C13V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he was crucified through weakness, 
yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will 
live with him through the power of God toward you. <A name=C13V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>13:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Test your own 
selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don't you know as 
to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed you are 
disqualified. <A name=C13V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But I hope that you will know that we 
aren't disqualified. 
<P><A name=C13V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now I pray to God that you do no evil; 
not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, 
though we are as reprobate. <A name=C13V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we can do nothing against the 
truth, but for the truth. <A name=C13V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For we rejoice when we are weak and you 
are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting. <A 
name=C13V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For this cause I write these things 
while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the 
authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down. 
<P><A name=C13V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be 
perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love 
and peace will be with you. <A name=C13V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Greet one another with a holy kiss. <A 
name=C13V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All the saints greet you. <A 
name=C13V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>13:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.
