<P><A name=C1V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God. <A name=C1V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As it is written in the prophets, 
<P>&nbsp;"Behold, I send my messenger before your 
face,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will prepare your way before 
you. 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=C1V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The voice of one crying in the 
wilderness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Make ready the way of the 
Lord!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make his paths straight!'" 
<P><A name=C1V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John came <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Mark.htm#N1">baptizing</A> in the 
wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. <A 
name=C1V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All 
the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were 
baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. <A name=C1V6><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John was clothed 
with camel's hair and a leather belt around his loins. He ate locusts and wild 
honey. <A name=C1V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He preached, saying, "After me comes he 
who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down 
and loosen. <A name=C1V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>I baptized you <A 
href="http://www.ebible.org/bible/web/Mark.htm#N2">in</A> water, but he will 
baptize you in the Holy Spirit." 
<P><A name=C1V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened in those days, that Jesus 
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <A 
name=C1V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately coming up from the water, 
he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <A 
name=C1V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>A 
voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." 
<P><A name=C1V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately the Spirit drove him out 
into the wilderness. <A name=C1V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He was there in the wilderness forty 
days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were 
ministering to him. 
<P><A name=C1V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now after John was taken into custody, 
Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, <A 
name=C1V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and saying, <FONT color=#ff0000>"The 
time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the 
Gospel."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he 
saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea, for they 
were fishermen. <A name=C1V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately they left their nets, and 
followed him. <A name=C1V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Going on a little further from there, 
he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the 
boat mending the nets. <A name=C1V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately he called them, and they 
left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after 
him. <A name=C1V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They went into Capernaum, and 
immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. <A 
name=C1V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were astonished at his teaching, 
for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <A 
name=C1V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately there was in their 
synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <A name=C1V24><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>saying, "Ha! What 
do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I 
know you who you are: the Holy One of God!" 
<P><A name=C1V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Be quiet, and come out of him!"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and 
crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <A name=C1V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They were all 
amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new 
teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey 
him!" <A name=C1V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The report of him went out immediately 
everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area. 
<P><A name=C1V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately, when they had come out of 
the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and 
John. <A name=C1V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with 
a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <A name=C1V31><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He came and took 
her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. <A 
name=C1V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>At 
evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those 
who were possessed by demons. <A name=C1V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:33</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>All the city was gathered together at 
the door. <A name=C1V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He healed many who were sick with 
various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak, 
because they knew him. 
<P><A name=C1V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Early in the night, he rose up and went 
out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. <A name=C1V36><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Simon and those who 
were with him followed after him; <A name=C1V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and they found him, and told him, 
"Everyone is looking for you." 
<P><A name=C1V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:38</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there 
also, because for this reason I came forth."</FONT> <A name=C1V39><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:39</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He went into their 
synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. 
<P><A name=C1V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There came to him a leper, begging him, 
kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me 
clean." 
<P><A name=C1V41><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Being moved with compassion, he 
stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"I 
want to. Be made clean."</FONT> <A name=C1V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he had said this, immediately the 
leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. <A name=C1V43><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>1:43</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He strictly warned 
him, and immediately sent him out, <A name=C1V44><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:44</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the 
priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a 
testimony to them."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C1V45><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>1:45</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he went out, and began to proclaim 
it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly 
enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from 
everywhere. 
<P><A name=C2V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:1</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When he entered again into Capernaum 
after some days, it was heard that he was in the house. <A name=C2V2><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately many 
were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the 
door; and he spoke the word to them. <A name=C2V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Four people came, carrying a paralytic 
to him. <A name=C2V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they could not come near to him for 
the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they 
let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. <A name=C2V5><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:5</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus, seeing their 
faith, said to the paralytic, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Son, your sins are forgiven 
you."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But there were some of the scribes 
sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <A name=C2V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>"Why does this man 
speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
<P><A name=C2V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his 
spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Why do you reason these things in your hearts? </FONT><A 
name=C2V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>Which is easier, to 
tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up 
your bed, and walk?' </FONT><A name=C2V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>But that you may 
know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"</FONT>--he said 
to the paralytic--<A name=C2V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>"I tell you, arise, 
take up your mat, and go to your house."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He arose, and immediately took up the 
mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and 
glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!" 
<P><A name=C2V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He went out again by the seaside. All 
the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <A name=C2V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>As he passed by, he 
saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Follow me."</FONT> And he arose and followed him. 
<P><A name=C2V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened, that he was reclining at 
the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus 
and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. <A 
name=C2V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The scribes and the Pharisees, when 
they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his 
disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?" 
<P><A name=C2V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>"Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but 
those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to 
repentance."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>John's disciples and the Pharisees were 
fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples 
of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?" 
<P><A name=C2V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said to them, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long 
as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast. </FONT><A 
name=C2V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>But the days will 
come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast 
in that day. </FONT><A name=C2V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT color=#ff0000>No one sews a piece 
of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears 
away from the old, and a worse hole is made. </FONT><A name=C2V22><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>2:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A><FONT 
color=#ff0000>No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will 
burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but 
they put new wine into fresh wineskins."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C2V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It happened that he was going on the 
Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to 
pluck the ears of grain. <A name=C2V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>2:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why 
do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?" 
<P><A name=C2V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

she may be made healthy, and live." 
<P><A name=C5V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. <A name=C5V25><FONT

who had an issue of blood for twelve years, <A name=C5V26><FONT

many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no 
better, but rather grew worse, <A name=C5V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes. <A

dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. 
<P><A name=C5V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in 
himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and 
asked, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Who touched my clothes?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C5V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>His disciples said to him, "You see the

<P><A name=C5V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

done this thing. <A name=C5V33><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him 
all the truth. 
<P><A name=C5V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:34</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to her, <FONT

of your disease."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C5V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:35</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>While he was still speaking, they came 
from the synagogue ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the 
Teacher any more?" 
<P><A name=C5V36><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:36</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus, when he heard the message 
spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Don't be afraid, only believe."</FONT> <A name=C5V37><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:37</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He allowed no one 
to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <A

came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great 
wailing. <A name=C5V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not 
dead, but is asleep."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C5V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:40</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They ridiculed him. But he, having put 
them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were 
with him, and went in where the child was lying. <A name=C5V41><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>5:41</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Taking the child by 
the hand, he said to her, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Talitha cumi;"</FONT> which 
means, being interpreted, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Girl, I tell you, get up."</FONT> 
<A name=C5V42><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>5:42</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately the girl rose up, and 
walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. <A

strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something 
should be given to her to eat. 
<P><A name=C6V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

own country, and his disciples followed him. <A name=C6V2><FONT

come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, 
saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is 
given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands? <A

size=-1><SUP>6:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Isn't this the carpenter, the son of 
Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here 
with us?" They were offended at him. 
<P><A name=C6V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

among his own relatives, and in his own house."</FONT> <A name=C6V5><FONT

mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and 
healed them. <A name=C6V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>He went around the villages teaching. <A name=C6V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He called to himself the twelve, and 
began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean 
spirits. <A name=C6V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He charged them that they should take 
nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in 
their purse, <A name=C6V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>but to wear sandals, and not put on two 
tunics. <A name=C6V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT

there. </FONT><A name=C6V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is

city!"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C6V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They went out and preached that people 
should repent. <A name=C6V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They cast out many demons, and anointed 
many with oil who were sick, and healed them. <A name=C6V14><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>King Herod heard 
this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen 
from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him." <A 
name=C6V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But others said, "It is Elijah." Others 
said, "It is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets." <A name=C6V16><FONT

heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead." 
<A name=C6V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For Herod himself had sent out and 
arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother 
Philip's wife, for he had married her. <A name=C6V18><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For John said to Herod, "It is not 
lawful for you to have your brother's wife." <A name=C6V19><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Herodias set 
herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn't, <A 
name=C6V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for Herod feared John, knowing that he 
was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many 
things, and he heard him gladly. 
<P><A name=C6V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Then a convenient day came, that Herod 
on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief 
men of Galilee. <A name=C6V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When the daughter of Herodias herself 
came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said 
to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you." <A 
name=C6V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>6:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my 
kingdom." 
<P><A name=C6V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

"What shall I ask?" 
<P>She said, "The head of John the Baptizer." 
<P><A name=C6V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>She came in immediately with haste to 
the king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the 
Baptizer on a platter." 
<P><A name=C6V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The king was exceedingly sorry, but for 
the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her. 
<A name=C6V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Immediately the king sent out a soldier 
of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him 
in the prison, <A name=C6V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>and brought his head on a platter, and 
gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother. 
<P><A name=C6V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When his disciples heard this, they 
came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. 
<P><A name=C6V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and 
whatever they had taught. <A name=C6V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:31</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT

For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
<A name=C6V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>6:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They went away in the boat to a desert

before them and came together to him. <A name=C6V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, 
and he began to teach them many things. <A name=C6V35><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C6V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>They asked him, "Shall we go and buy <A

of bread, and give them something to eat?" 
<P><A name=C6V38><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

color=#ff0000>"How many loaves do you have? Go see."</FONT> 
<P>When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish." 
<P><A name=C6V39><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

sit down in groups on the green grass. <A name=C6V40><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to 
his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all. <A

into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself 
sent the multitude away. <A name=C6V46><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

went up the mountain to pray.

distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch

them, <A name=C6V49><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; <A name=C6V50><FONT

wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled; <A

little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down 
at his feet. <A name=C7V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:26</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now the woman was a Greek, a 
Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her 
daughter. <A name=C7V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>7:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But Jesus said to her, <FONT

take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C7V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 
<P><A name=C7V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

daughter."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C7V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out. 
<P><A name=C7V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region 
of Decapolis. <A name=C7V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. <A

took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, 
and he spat, and touched his tongue. <A name=C7V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

said to him, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Ephphatha!"</FONT> that is, <FONT

the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. <A

commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so 
much the more widely they proclaimed it. <A name=C7V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute 
speak!" 
<P><A name=C8V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to 
himself, and said to them, <A name=C8V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?" 
<P><A name=C8V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>They said, "Seven." 
<P><A name=C8V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, 
and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude. <A

had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also. <A

ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left 
over. <A name=C8V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing 
him. <A name=C8V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"Why does this <A

Most assuredly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C8V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

the boat, departed to the other side. <A name=C8V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C8V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P>Peter answered, "You are the Christ." 
<P><A name=C8V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

no one about him. <A name=C8V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, 
and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. <A 
name=C8V32><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>8:32</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He 
spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <A

<P><A name=C8V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by 
themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them. <A

for Elijah." <A name=C9V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <A name=C9V10><FONT

saying to themselves, questioning what the "rising from the dead" meant. 
<P><A name=C9V11><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They asked him, saying, "Why do the 
scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 
<P><A name=C9V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>9:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, <FONT

him. <A name=C9V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

"Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; <A name=C9V18><FONT

wallowing and foaming at the mouth. 
<P><A name=C9V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<P><A name=C9V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

cried out with tears, "I believe. Help my unbelief!" 
<P><A name=C9V25><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, <FONT

never enter him again!"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C9V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

them said, "He is dead." <A name=C9V27><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

raised him up; and he arose. 
<P><A name=C9V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

said to them, <FONT color=#ff0000>"This kind can come out by nothing, except by

<P><A name=C9V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

through Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know it. <A name=C9V31><FONT

yourselves on the way?"</FONT> 
<P><A name=C9V34><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

death, and found none. <A name=C14V56><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

gave false testimony against him, saying, <A name=C14V58><FONT

'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will

agree. 
<P><A name=C14V60><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

you?" <A name=C14V61><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

nothing. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the 
Blessed?" 
<P><A name=C14V62><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:62</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Jesus said, <FONT color=#ff0000>"I AM.

the clouds of the sky."</FONT> 
<P><A name=C14V63><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:63</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The high priest tore his clothes, and 
said, "What further need have we of witnesses? <A name=C14V64><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:64</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>You have heard the 
blasphemy! What do you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death. <A 
name=C14V65><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:65</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Some began to spit on him, and to 
cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The 
officers struck him with the palms of their hands. 
<P><A name=C14V66><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

one of the maids of the high priest came, <A name=C14V67><FONT

warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, 
Jesus!" 
<P><A name=C14V68><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

know, nor understand what you are saying." He went out on the porch, and the 
rooster crowed. 
<P><A name=C14V69><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:69</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The maid saw him, and began again to 
tell those who stood by, "This is one of them." <A name=C14V70><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:70</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he again 
denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You 
truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it." <A 
name=C14V71><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>14:71</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But he began to curse, and to swear, 
"I don't know this man of whom you speak!" <A name=C14V72><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>14:72</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The rooster crowed 
the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>"Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three 
times."</FONT> When he thought about that, he wept. 
<P><A name=C15V1><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a 
consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to 
Pilate. <A name=C15V2><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:2</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of 
the Jews?" 
<P>He answered, "So you say." 
<P><A name=C15V3><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:3</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The chief priests accused him of many 
things. <A name=C15V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

answer? See how many things they testify against you!" 
<P><A name=C15V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

that Pilate marveled. 
<P><A name=C15V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now at the feast he used to release to 
them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. <A name=C15V7><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:7</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>There was one 
called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the 
insurrection had committed murder. <A name=C15V8><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:8</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The multitude, crying aloud, began to 
ask him to do as he always did for them. <A name=C15V9><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you 
want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" <A name=C15V10><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:10</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>For he perceived 
that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <A name=C15V11><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:11</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>But the chief 
priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them 
instead. <A name=C15V12><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:12</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate again asked them, "What then 
should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 
<P><A name=C15V13><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:13</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They cried out again, "Crucify him!" 
<P><A name=C15V14><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:14</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil 
has he done?" 
<P>But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!" 
<P><A name=C15V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:15</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Pilate, wishing to please the 
multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged 
him, to be crucified. <A name=C15V16><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:16</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The soldiers led him away within the 
court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. <A 
name=C15V17><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:17</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They clothed him with purple, and 
weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <A name=C15V18><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:18</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They began to 
salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" <A name=C15V19><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:19</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They struck his head with a reed, and 
spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <A name=C15V20><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:20</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>When they had 
mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. 
They led him out to crucify him. <A name=C15V21><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:21</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They compelled one passing by, coming 
from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with 
them, that he might bear his cross. <A name=C15V22><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:22</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They brought him to the place called 
Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull." <A 
name=C15V23><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:23</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh 
to drink, but he didn't take it. 
<P><A name=C15V24><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:24</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Crucifying him, they parted his 
garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. <A

size=-1><SUP>15:25</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>It was <A

crucified him. <A name=C15V26><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS." <A name=C15V27><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>15:27</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>With him they 
crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. <A 
name=C15V28><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:28</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>The Scripture was fulfilled, which 
says, "He was numbered with transgressors." 
<P><A name=C15V29><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:29</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Those who passed by blasphemed him, 
wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it 
in three days, <A name=C15V30><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>15:30</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>save yourself, and come down from the

<P><A name=C15V31><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can't save

Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down." 
<P><A name=C15V37><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for 
us?" <A name=C16V4><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:4</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>for it was very big. Looking up, they 
saw that the stone was rolled back. 
<P><A name=C16V5><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were 
amazed. <A name=C16V6><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT 
size=-1><SUP>16:6</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>He said to them, "Don't be amazed. You

Behold, the place where they laid him! <A name=C16V7><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They 
said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid. <A name=C16V9><FONT 
color=#0000ff><FONT size=-1><SUP>16:9</SUP></FONT></FONT></A>Now when he had 
risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, 
from whom he had cast out seven demons. <A name=C16V10><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

him after he had risen. <A name=C16V15><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

God. <A name=C16V20><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT
