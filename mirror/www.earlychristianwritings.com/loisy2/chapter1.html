<center><h2><i>Chapter I</i></h2></center>
<P>
<center><h2>THE BIBLE AS SUPERNATURAL</h2></center>
<P>
ORTHODOX defenders of Scripture, especially its Catholic
defenders, are wont to charge independent critics with lacking
intuitive perception of the supernatural which, according to their
accusers, shines out in the Scriptures, especially in the New
Testament, thus creating a privileged position for the books
sacred to Christians and clothing them with authority beyond the
range of discussion. These, they say, are divine books alike by
their origin and character, replete with truth for all time; records
of clearly miraculous events, by which God, from the beginning
of time, showed forth the salvation of humanity in signs, prepared
it, and at last made it effectual.
<P>
In all this, a double meaning, an equivocation, is clearly
apparent, of which both the orthodox apologist and the overconfident
critic seem alike to be the victims. There are two
"supernaturals." The one, which we shall designate as magical,
is found existing in all religions and mythologies, as well as in
fairy tales; in this kind of supernatural the Jewish and Christian
Scriptures have their full share, both in their content and in the
orthodox tradition which interprets them. The other, which we
shall designate as moral and spiritual, is manifested by the
religions of humanity in marvellous outbursts of spiritual life,
more notable in some religions, less in others, but outstandingly
intense in Judaism and Christianity and conferring on these two
an eminent place in the moral evolution of mankind. This
supernatural reality is overlooked by those extremists who can see
in religion, and in its beliefs and practice, nothing more than the
transmission of time-honoured and oppressive absurdities. But
this supernatural, while not a miracle in the vulgar sense of the
word, belongs to a higher realm than the miraculous. It is the only
supernatural worthy of the name and the only kind whose real
existence can be confidently affirmed. And theologians who,
thinking to defend it, confuse it with miraculous magic, understand
it but ill and serve it no better.
<P>
<center>10</center>
<P>
The idea of books entirely God-made, but written in the
languages of men, in the native dialects of particular peoples and
in the idiom of given times, an idea widely spread in the ancient
world and retained in Christian orthodoxy, is inconsistent and
self-contradictory. Professional authors are relatively newcomers
in the history of our race. But even if they were more
ancient than they are, we can hardly imagine anything more indiscreet,
not to say more flagrantly impious, than to put God among
these worthies, where he has to be furnished with assistants, as
though he could not dispense with them, to write down what he
would say and attend to the publication of his works. Theologians
tax their wits to explain how God can be, in any real sense, the
author of books which he has neither written himself nor dictated
word by word. Their explanation is that he suggested them.
How do they know that? Do they really understand what they
are saying?
<P>
Had they taken the pains to look into the matter, without
thought of axes to be ground, they would have seen that the
books themselves make not the slightest claim to the divine
origin attributed to them by the theologians, but are in fact made
up, in the human manner, of tradition and teaching; of rules
political, social and ritual; of liturgical chants; of oracles deemed
prophetic (not uncommon in the ancient world, and of which we
should be hard put to it to find the fulfilment); of collections of
moral precepts such as we find among all nations; and of a group
of myths, clearly recognizable as such, to account for the origin
of the world and of mankind. All of which has undergone an age-long
process of glossing and amalgamation clearly due to human
initiative, and not even to be thought of as proceeding from
God's initiative in any part or stage of it. What anthropomorphism
could be more naive than that which counts the authorship
of books among the attributes of God?
<P>
These remarks, it will be said, apply to the Old Testament
only. They apply equally to the New. A long, slow process
brought the Gospels to their present form without any sign of
divine initiative at the beginning or the end or at any point
between the two; at a given time they were selected, from among
<P>
<center>11</center>
<P>
many, by the Church authorities and the text of their content
finally determined. The same is true of the Acts of the Apostles.
It is well worthy cf note that the author of the third Gospel and
of Acts, who wrote the prologues to Theophilus, assumes full
responsibility for his work, for his method and for the object he
has in view. The apostolic Epistles, authentic or not, are personal
works called forth by particular occasions. Moreover a considerable
part of them are forgeries, for which it would be unseemly
enough to make God directly responsible. And what of the Book
of Revelation듮he Apocalypse of John? The best that can be said
of it is that for centuries men have taxed their wits to find in it a
meaning which is not there, for the simple reason that the meaning
which is there was immediately contradicted by the course of
events. Alas, this glowing prophecy was not fulfilled. Who can
believe that it came entire from God? In short, the idea of God
as author of books is a myth, if ever there was one, and a myth
redolent of magic. A book written by the hand of man and filled
throughout with the light of God is as inconceivable as a square
circle. The books reputed all divine are simply not filled with
truth from beginning to end듡ar from it! They contain as many
errors as books of their kind, written when they were, could be
made to hold.
<P>
To this notion of divine authorship, so artificial and fragile,
the Church committed her future and compromised it in so doing.
Persuaded that her sacred books were filled with truth for all time
she has not hesitated to oppose them to the scientific movement
of our age. We know what has come of that. Everyone has
heard of Galileo's adventure and knows what it meant. Meanwhile
the Church continues to equivocate; even on the affair of
Galileo which, nevertheless, is transparently clear. She is still
convinced, and would have it believed, that her sacred books
contain nothing contrary to truth about the order of the universe,
and that the Bible, though knowing nothing about the matter,
does not contradict it, but only uses the common language of
mankind which speaks of things as they seem to be. Can she
really believe that by a subterfuge of this kind, which amounts to
charging the Scriptures with ignorance, she is really safeguarding
their divine authority? Is there any denying that the first chapters
of Genesis profess to give a true account of the creation of the
<P>
<center>12</center>
<P>
world, the origin of humanity up to the Deluge and the genealogy
of the peoples? All that is unadulterated myth, the babblings of
humanity's childhood, but not unmingled with sublimity. If God
is the responsible author of the story he must have been ignorant
of the constitution of the universe which, on the orthodox
hypothesis, he had created, and equally ignorant of the long and
confused pre-history of the race which he had brought into being
and established on the earth to serve him.
<P>
Not only at this starting point, but along the whole line of
historical and literary criticism, the traditional doctrine is in
complete collapse. To begin with, consider the question which
concerns the authenticity of the documents. Since God is their
author the divine guarantee covers their attribution to the
particular scribes whose names they carry. What an embarrassment
is thereby erected by the Pentateuch alone! The attribution
of this collection to Moses is attested by Jewish tradition, but
equally, it would seem, by the New Testament and by the
authority of the Christ himself who, in a certain passage of the
fourth Gospel (John v, 46), declares that Moses wrote concerning
him. And yet it is the almost unanimous verdict of critics that
the oldest sources from which the compilation is derived go no
further back than the time of the Israelite monarchy, while the
bulk of the cultural legislation contained in it is later than the Babylonian
captivity. Not a page, one might even say not a line, can
be traced to him whom the tradition of Israel and of the Christian
Church regards as the founder of Jewish religion. To explain
the divinity of the sources the Papal Commission of Biblical
Study declared, in a memorable decree, that Moses had secretaries.
The secretaries of Moses! A brilliant discovery, to be sure! But
we have nothing to do with them since, if these interesting
persons ever existed, we should have to admit that not a trace of
their work has come down to us.
<P>
This, far from being a solitary case, is only one of the more
conspicuous and significant. The case of Isaiah is also worth
recalling. The book named after Isaiah as it appears in the Bible
contains much besides the authentic oracles of the prophet who
was contemporary with Ezechias. Notably one whole section,
the last twenty-four chapters, were written, as all the evidence
shows, either in presence of the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus
<P>
<center>13</center>
<P>
or shortly afterwards. None the less they were reputed the work
of Isaiah for the sole reason that in the process of copying the
manuscript they were attached to the roll that had Isaiah's name
on it. Speaking generally we may say that the oracles of the
ancient prophets have been systematically completed and interpolated
in the process of coming down to us. Has the veracity
of God nothing to do with the false attribution of these additions
to the authors of the original oracles?
<P>
The question assumes a more difficult aspect, if that be
possible, when we turn to the books of the New Testament.
Here all the writings have human authors who either name themselves
or are expressly indicated by tradition. Everyone knows that
the Church recognized and retained four Gospels respectively
attributed to the apostle Matthew, to Mark (reputed a disciple of
Peter), to Luke, who was a disciple of Paul, and to the apostle
John. Now it is morally certain, and admitted by the majority
even of moderate critics, that these attributions are, to say the
least, approximative, the books not having been written all at
one time by single hands nor given their present canonical form
from the beginning. Many, moreover, are of the opinion that not
one of the Gospels is the work of the apostolic person whose
name it bears, and that the apostle John, in particular, had nothing
whatever to do with writing the Gospel attributed to him. But, if
God is their guarantee, his veracity demands that each of them
be integrally the work of the author assigned by tradition. We
shall return to these Gospels later on to find that their contents,
no less than their presumed authenticity, are replete with difficulties
for the apologists in question.
<P>
We have already mentioned the Acts of the Apostles, a book
which, like the third Gospel, presents conditions somewhat
peculiar. Alone among New Testament writings these two carry
a dedication, of a well-known type in Greco-Roman antiquity.
Luke was not the author of the dedications to Theophilus, the
general prologue (Luke i, 1-4) forbidding us to include the
author of it in the first Christian generation. Furthermore, the
part of the prologue to Acts which has been preserved implies
that the former book to Theophilus did not contain the birth
stories and related only the ministry of the Christ up to the time
of his death. Finally all the evidence shows that the second part
<P>
<center>14</center>
<P>
of the original prologue to Acts, in which the proper object of
the book was stated by the original author, has been mutilated
by a writer who understood that object in a different manner
from the author to Theophilus and who, in consequence, had to
reconstruct his book from beginning to end as, in fact, he has
done. All this later writer has conserved of Luke's work is certain
fragments of his memoirs of which the original author to
Theophilus had made a fuller use. It follows that Luke wrote
neither the third Gospel nor Acts. He wrote only certain passages
of the latter book, and we are compelled to recognize at least two
stages in the composition of both books. It would seem, however
that the veracity of God forbids us to observe and record such
things, and obliges us to maintain that both books, in their
canonical edition, are from the hand of Luke.
<P>
According to tradition Paul wrote fourteen Epistles and the
veracity of God demands the belief that all are truly his. But the
Epistle to the Hebrews is positively not from him; the second to
Thessalonians is almost certainly apocryphal; so is the Epistle
to the Ephesians; many hold that the Epistles to Timothy and to
Titus, in their main contents, cannot be his. And we have already
pointed out in another work1 that there is much to be said
against the full authenticity of the Epistles to the Romans, to
the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the Colossians. Here is a
group of questions which the veracity of God forbids us even
to raise.
<P>
As to the Catholic Epistles, there is strong reason to think that
the Church deemed it necessary to include in the Canon, as
pendant to Paul's Epistles, a number of others bearing the names
of reputed apostolic persons other than he, notably Peter, John
and the two "brothers of the Lord" James and Jude. Not one of
these Epistles goes back to the first Christian age. Pseudo-James
launches discreet polemic against the theory in Romans of
justification by faith alone; pseudo-Jude crosses swords with the
gnostics; pseudo-Peter, in the second Epistle, repeats the diatribe
of pseudo-Jude and cites a collection of Paul's Epistles of which
heretics are making wrong use듩ot as natural a proceeding as
defenders of tradition would make out. For there is not a doubt
that he was aiming at Marcion towards the middle of the second
<P>
<center>15</center>
<P>
century. Add to this that the author, at the beginning of the same
Epistle, refers implicitly to the Apocalypse of Peter, composed
towards the year 135; a supreme instance of false attribution,
though the writing was held in credit by some of the Churches
to the end of the second century. The second Epistle of Peter is
a barefaced forgery. The first Epistle is not more authentic; it
depends on the Pauline group and cannot be earlier than the
second third of the second century. The three Epistles attributed
to John were composed in the course of the same century to
accompany the fourth Gospel when its claims were being pressed
among the Asiatic Churches. They are no more the work of the
apostle John than is the Gospel itself. But the veracity of God
would give us no alternative to believing that all these apocryphal
productions come from the persons whose names they bear.
Need we add that the Book of Revelation is the work of a certain
John who was not John the apostle?
<P>
We abstain from the cruelty of further insistence. He compromises
God who makes him the author of written books.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>MIRACULOUS MAGIC AS AN OPERATING CAUSE OF EVENTS</font></center>
<P>
The compromising effect on traditional belief, due to confounding
the supernatural with magic, is equally apparent when
we consider the particular events for which magic is made
responsible. We limit our remarks to a few essential points in the
two Testaments.
<P>
The myth of creation in the first chapter of Genesis need not
delay us for long. The creation, by the spoken word, of the
different parts of the universe, childishly conceived as cut up into
separate compartments, is an act of divine magic, which all the
goodwill of its apologists will never succeed in bringing into
harmony with the known facts of cosmic and terrestrial evolution.
The wonder-story of Eden, with the creation of the first human
pair and the commission of the first sin, older than the cosmic
myth both in conception and structure, is also an obvious myth,
a scene from the realm of enchantment where the imagination of
adolescent mankind, just beginning to reflect, finds its playground.
Whence comes death? is the question then asked.
Imagination answers, surely death is something that need not
<P>
<center>16</center>
<P>
have been; the first man and the first woman ate a strange fruit
which their creator had forbidden them to eat. Among good tales
here is one finely told. But nothing more.
<P>
Another such, mythological and purely pagan, is the story of
the intercourse of the sons of God, the angels, with the daughters
of men, of which were born the giants whose abominable
conduct brought on the Deluge, a story no more worthy of
belief when found in the Bible than when found in the old
fables of Greece about the union of gods with mortal women,
but adopted as true in both Epistles of Peter and in the Epistle
of Jude.
<P>
As to the Deluge itself, it is beyond dispute that the myth
was created in Lower Mesopotamia. The prototype of the Bible
story has been found in the bricks of Nineveh and the priority
of the Accadian text admits not the slightest doubt: another
old fable which Israelite tradition has borrowed from ancient
Mesopotamia and has little enough to do with the true history
of mankind.
<P>
Then the Tower of Babel and the miraculous confusion of
tongues, a miracle on the grand scale intended to explain the
diversity of peoples, but pure fiction, explaining nothing. A
genealogy of the nations which traces their descent from
Adam through Noah is little more than a fantasy to smile at,
whose sole historical interest lies in a crude chart, or something
like it, of the peoples inhabiting the Eastern shore of the
Mediterranean at the time the chart was made. Another instance
of the mythological fiction to which all these prodigies
are reducible.
<P>
Turning next to the origin of the Israelites we are not surprised,
after what has gone before, to learn that this people also is
descended from a single couple, Abraham and his wife Sarah,
emigrants from Mesopotamia. Abraham and Sarah produced
Isaac who had twin sons, Esau and Jacob, by his wife Rebecca,
Esau or Edom, ancestor of the Idumeans; Jacob, finally
called Israel, who begat of four wives twelve sons, fathers
of the twelve tribes of Israel; the eleventh of these sons is sold
by his brothers and carried off into Egypt where he became
Pharaoh's chief-minister, in so much that on famine breaking
out in Canaan, Jacob and his family migrate to the fertile lands of
<P>
<center>17</center>
<P>
Egypt where they have various experiences; on arrival they are
seventy in number; after several generations they become a great
people multiplying at such a rate that the Egyptians become
alarmed; the Pharaoh of the time who, we are told, knew not
Joseph, gives orders to destroy all the Hebrew males as soon as
born; but God, who has called Abraham out of Mesopotamia and
promised the land of Canaan to his posterity, brings it to pass
that the child of a certain Amram, of the tribe of Levi, is found
by Pharaoh's daughter exposed in a wicker cradle on the Nile and
brought up; this child is Moses; his brilliant career then follows;
his flight into Midian and return into Egypt; his unloosing of
plagues on Egypt by raising his magic wand which changes into
a serpent; departure from Egypt of the chosen people under
Moses and his brother Aaron; passage of the Red Sea which
divides its waters to let the Israelites pass over and closes them
again on Pharaoh's army. Then come forty years in the desert
and the feeding of the people with manna and quails, and with
water made by Moses to gush from the rock, ending with the
departure of the host from the desert for the conquest of Canaan
and the death of Moses on Mount Pisgah, whence he can see the
land where Israel is to settle. Then comes the passage of the
Jordan whose bed becomes dry for the march of the Israelites,
and the capture of Jericho whose walls collapse at the sound of
Israel's trumpets; the battle of Gibeon where Joshua makes the
sun stand still that Israel may have time to complete the enemy's
overthrow. After which Joshua proceeds at leisure to parcel out
the conquered land among the tribes.
<P>
A splendid epic, from which, alas, history can glean hardly
a particle of solid matter. Clearly enough its construction of
Israel's genealogy is artificial. Peoples are not born in that way.
The names, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob-Israel, certainly existed and each
of these vocables must have originally corresponded to somebody
or to something, but to whom, or to what, is not easily determined.
Jacob, as everyone knows, won his name of Israel in a
strange combat in which he got the better of God himself. His
twelve sons are not simple individuals but types of heroes,
divine or tribal. The patriarchal myths figure a peaceful occupation
of Canaan and these are doubled, so to say, by myths of a
conquest which, taken as they stand, are hardly less imaginative
<P>
<center>18</center>
<P>
than the former. The adventures of Joseph make a noble story
linking the two series of myths together, but nothing of it can be
retained by the historian. That relations existed of old between
the tribes and Egypt is beyond doubt, but what is here narrated
of them never happened. It is to be noted that the legend cannot
even give the name of the Pharaoh who exalted Joseph and
welcomed his family, and is equally ignorant of the name of the
Pharaoh who turned oppressor. Commentators are still cudgelling
their brains to discover these names; they may continue
to cudgel them to the end of the world but will never find what
they seek. The Moses legend is a counterpart to the myth of the
oppression and miraculous flight, which the different sources of
the Pentateuch have adorned with prodigies enough and to spare.
The least uncertain point of the Moses legend is its attachment
to the sanctuary of Kadesh. If Moses ever existed it was at Kadesh
that he gave out the law, near to the fountain of Judgment, and
manipulated the casting of lots {unm and thummim) which seems
to have traditionally belonged to Levi. The Book of the Covenant
was not his work, but belongs to the time of the monarchy;
neither was Deuteronomy which dates from the reign of Josias, if
not from the first years of the captivity; nor the legislation known
as Levitical which is less ancient than Deuteronomy. And not only
is the authorship of these books none of his; it is improbable
that he had any part in the migration of the tribes towards the
land of Canaan. This movement had a character very different
from that of a conquest achieved by one sweeping stroke. When
exactly it began we cannot say and it was not completed before
the establishment of the monarchy. Various movements of penetration
have to be distinguished; one, from the South by the
tribes of Judah, Simeon and Levi, of which that of Judah alone
succeeded, the tribes of Simeon and Levi becoming exhausted in
the course of it, while another thrust, by the Northern tribes, was
made to the East and, in course of time, with more success. It is
possible that Joshua played a leading part in the early battles,
and that is all we can claim to know about him. Few persons
nowadays can seriously believe that he caused the sun to stand
still over Gibeon, which some chronicler inferred from what he
read in a collection of heroic songs, the Jashar (Joshua x, 13).
This chronicler, whether understanding or misunderstanding
<P>
<center>19</center>
<P>
what he read, was clearly the dupe of his gift as a story-teller. [1]
<P>
Of the other Old Testament miracles we pause but for a
moment over that of Jonah shut up for three days and three nights
in the belly of a great fish, and while there even composing a
hymn to the glory of the Lord. To question the historicity of this
splendid story is doubtless impermissible, but belief in it is not
easy. From the historical point of view it has the same guarantees
as the adventures of Puss-in-boots or of Hop-o'-my-thumb.
<P>
We hasten on to the New Testament which is hardly less
penetrated by magic than the Old. On the very threshold we
meet an undeniable proof in the stories of the miraculous birth.
Two genealogies confront us: the first in Matthew (i, 1-17)
comes down from Abraham to Jesus; the second in Luke
(iii, 23-38) goes up from Jesus to Adam. (As to the latter we have
only to think for a moment on the degree of impossibility
involved, in a genealogy of any individual belonging to the
human race, which takes its departure from the origin of that race
itself. For that reason alone the bare idea of such a list of ancestors
belongs unquestionably to the realm of magic.) In the generations
covered by both lists they disagree, and will never agree in spite
of all the forced and ridiculous conjectures of their interpreters.
Moreover드nd this is the chief point to be noted들t is clear
to all who open their eyes that they were invented to show that
Jesus was descended from David through his father Joseph, the
last name on the list. This, their original aim, is completely upset
<P>
[1] It seems probable that the original citation ended with the distich given in verse 12:
<P>
<blockquote>
Sun stand thou still over Gibeon
And thou, Moon, over the valley of Ajalon,
</blockquote>
<P>
the object of the apostrophe being different from what the writer of <i>Joshua</i> takes it to be.
In the Greek version of 1 Kings viii, 53 we find a similar citation, with the reference,
which seems to have alone preserved tile complete text, as spoken by Solomon about the
Temple. Reconstructed from the Greek text their meaning would be:
<P>
<blockquote>
"Jehovah has fixed the Sun's place in the heavens;
He bade the Sun take his stand beyond the darkness;
I have built thee a house for thy habitation
In which thou shalt dwell month by month."
</blockquote>
<P>
This refers to the passage of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac and is borrowed
from a creation-poem. It was easy in the time when Joshua was written to make the sun
stand still. Cf. <i>Iliad</i>, ii, 411; <i>Odyssey</i>, xxiii, 243.
<P>
<center>20</center>
<P>
by the introduction of the idea of the virgin conception at a later
stage in the development of the story.
<P>
That is not all. The two stories, in their main features, have
independent origins. That in the third Gospel seems to be a
counterpart to a legend of John the Baptist, to which it has been
joined on. It presents the parents of Jesus, already espoused, in
their home in Nazareth when the angel Gabriel appeared on the-and
need we say that the proceedings of angels do not
impress the modern historian as very solidly guaranteed? Gabriel
informs Mary, whose fiance Joseph is said to belong to the house
of David, that she will give birth to a son who will be the Messiah;
as guarantee that the promise will be fulfilled he cites the case
of Elisabeth whose miraculous pregnancy may well serve for
testimony. Here comes a surcharge on the original text in the
two verses which announce the virgin conception (Luke i, 34-35).
Passing over the marvels which immediately follow and adorn
the story, we come to the circumstance which brings Joseph and
Mary from their home in Nazareth to Bethlehem, the city of
David, in order that Jesus may be born there듮he census for
taxation ordered by Quirinius. Now the census of Quirinius did
not take place before the year 6 of our era, and we are told that
the whole affair happened in the time of Herod who died four
years before our era began; whence results a difference of at least
ten years between the birth of Jesus and the census of Quirinius.
To this our hagiographer has paid no heed, and the exegetes
labour in vain to put the matter right. We have no heart to dwell
on the intervention of angels on the memorable birth-night to
guide the shepherds to the cradle. Eight days afterwards the child
is circumcised, at the end of forty taken to Jerusalem to be
ransomed as a first-born; the aged Simeon prophesies concerning
him; the venerable Anna likewise, and the parents return quietly
to their home town of Nazareth. The legend is a work of art, and
of next to no value as a record of historical happenings.
<P>
Luke's story, moreover, flatly contradicts the legend in
Matthew, which is no less artificially constructed and no better
founded than the other. In this Gospel the home of Joseph and
Mary is not Nazareth, but Bethlehem, where they are living as an
espoused couple, and it is at Bethlehem that the miraculous
conception takes place, an angel explaining the matter to Joseph
<P>
<center>21</center>
<P>
and quieting the misgivings which such an announcement could
hardly fail to arouse. All this happens, so the hagiographer
informs us, as the fulfilment of an oracle in Isaiah vii, 14, on which
he puts a forced meaning드 point we shall not dwell upon,
since a meaning, more or less forced, is put on all the Old Testament texts alleged to have their fulfilment in the New, a proceeding well in keeping with supernatural magic by forcing into
texts meanings not naturally theirs. After this the legend becomes
solemn and tragic: astrologers (Magi) arrive from the East at
Jerusalem to adore the King of the Jews about to be born there
듮hey have seen the rising of his star. Disturbed by the news
Herod assembles his wise men who declare that the Messiah must
be born in Bethlehem, for so, they say, the prophet Micah has
foretold. The astrologers accordingly take the road to Bethlehem,
Herod requesting them to return to Jerusalem to report. The
star reappears, and guides them to the house where the child is
laid; they enter, adore, offer their gifts, and, a premonitory dream
warning them not to see Herod again, they return to their
country by a different road. Another angel commands Joseph to
fly into Egypt with the child and his mother, to escape from
Herod's inquisition. So to Egypt they depart, thereby accomplishing an oracle of Hosea (xi, i)등hich refers to the Israelite
people. Follows the massacre of children in Bethlehem and
the region round about, according to a prophecy of Jeremiah
(xxxi, 15)듡orced like the others into the service. At last the
cruel Herod dies; an angel bids Joseph return to Judea, to Bethlehem; but this he dares not do and betakes himself instead to
Galilee, to Nazareth, thereby fulfilling a saying of prophecy
concerning the Christ: "he shall be called a Nazarene." But the
exegetes have been unable to discover where the prophecy is to
be found.
<P>
The important point to note is that Matthew's legend is
incompatible with Luke's from beginning to end: the two are
equally full of marvels and magic; but neither is inwardly consistent
and the two cancel each other out. In their mythology and
magic they belong to the history of the growth of belief and
throw not a ray of light on the historical origin of Jesus.
<P>
Supernaturalism of the same type, a mixture of magic and
mythology, colours the main body of the Gospel narrative to a
<P>
<center>22</center>
<P>
lesser degree, but it is far from being absent. Moreover it is clear
from the outset that the account of the public career of Jesus
from his baptism by John to his death and entry into immortal
life, though having a certain resemblance in all the four Gospels,
is understood by the fourth, as to its principal features, in a sense
quite different from that given to it by the first three.
<P>
In the first three, a figure, to all seeming that of a human
being, presents himself for John's baptism and receives it under
miraculous conditions, in which he is invested with the Messianic
dignity of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit is henceforth to possess
him, having first appointed him Son of God. Setting aside the
secondary variants in the three Gospels this scene clearly represents
the consecration of Jesus as Messiah and is at the same time
the prototype of Christian baptism, in other words it is the first
and principal stage in the formation of the myth of the Christ
and of the institution of baptism. Though Jesus was probably
baptized by John it was not under these conditions. In this we see
that tlie synoptic account does not begin as an historical record
of Jesus the teacher. It begins as doctrinal instruction, as a
catechesis, by presenting a doctrine to the Christian initiate.
All that follows up to the end is in keeping with the beginning.
<P>
As we shall later study in detail the growth of the Gospel
catechesis, we confine attention for the present to its general
features. It is certain that all the materials of the Gospel catechesis,
various and ill-ordered as they are, are intended to show that the
teaching was wonder-working. Jesus is the Messiah announced
by the miracle of his baptism. To this point of view everything is
systematically adjusted. The aim is the instruction of Christians,
not at presenting the real course of Jesus' ministry which, for all
who have eyes to see, consisted in the announcement of the
imminent Kingdom of God; in this the role of miracle-worker
can have had but a very small place. The number of miracles of
which a detailed description is given is not considerable, and it is
worthy of note that whenever a miracle is described in detail the
meaning of it lies in the saving work accomplished by Jesus; its
mystic significance as a work of salvation always outweighs the
importance of the material facts. With regard to these latter the
Gospel narratives are completely indifferent, witness the facility
with which different evangelists change the setting, modifying
<P>
<center>23</center>
<P>
at will the order and connection of events and circumstances,
and not hesitating, by way of making the proof more convincing,
to introduce what we may call editorial miracles to heighten the
<i>mise en scene</i>, or to make a discourse more impressive. Offensive
as such proceedings may be to modern standards, they are valuable
to the critic by revealing the ground on which the Gospel stories
are constructed, the ground namely of doctrinal teaching and
pious legend, and not the ground of history. We shall enter later
into fuller detail; note only, as typical examples, the bloc of
miracles which Jesus, in Mark iii, 10-12, performs, before proceeding
to the mission of the apostles; the miraculous cure of the
two blind men (ix, 27-33) in which Matthew doubles the cure of
Bartimeus at Jericho, and the cure of the deaf mute brought in at
the same point (ix, 32-34), both to provide ground for the
answer Jesus will presently give to John's messengers; in like
manner the raising of the young man at Nain (Luke vii, 11-17),
which a reviser of the third Gospel improvises for the same pur-
pose and on the same occasion, to say nothing of the miscellaneous
collection of miraculous cures which he inserts so oddly
(vii, 21) in the middle of the dialogue between Jesus and the
messengers. By these proceedings the evangelists themselves
invite us to rate such miracles at their proper worth. They are
piled up to satiety and without more scruple than if they were
metaphors.
<P>
The second part of the synoptic catechism, introduced by
Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi, has a perspective leading
up to its dominating feature in the saving death of Jesus, which
he is represented as predicting on various occasions for the
instruction of his disciples. Fundamentally this part of the
catechism is intended to explain the mystery of the Communion
Supper along with that of the Christian Easter, celebrated on
Sunday. We know that the observation of Easter on this particular
day of the week was adopted by the majority of the Churches,
beginning with the Roman Church, in the course of the second
century. Needless to say it was not the primitive custom. It
is certain that the earliest believers were in the habit of celebrating
their Passover on the movable day when the Jews celebrated
theirs, and it was only when the idea of a distinctively Christian
<P>
<center>24</center>
<P>
method of salvation had been elaborated that it was deemed
expedient to separate from Jewish practice by celebrating on a
fixed day, as the culminating point of the divine epiphany and
saving work of Jesus. This was his resurrection, and Sunday
which had already become the Lord's Day, that is the day
consecrated to the immortal Christ, was obviously the day on
which the resurrection must be supposed to have taken place.
Here again we are on doctrinal ground, the ground even of gnosis
and mystery, not on that of history or attested fact.
<P>
But even at this point the Gospel narratives are far from
reflecting a consistent and homogeneous tradition. The stories of
the Passion and of the Resurrection are loaded with other matter
and full of incoherencies. In Mark the last meal of Jesus, which
was not a paschal meal in the earliest version of it, has been
doubled in the story of the Anointing (xiv, 3-9), the intention
apparently being to arrange a kind of holy week, in which the
institution of the Supper was commemorated on Thursday
evening, when Jesus himself was said to have celebrated the
Passover; the Passion would then be assigned to Friday. Passing
over the flagrant impossibility of Jesus being arrested and tried
by the Sanhedrin on the holy night of the Passover, we find that
he remains in the tomb for the whole of the Sabbath (Saturday)
and is raised up just before the dawn on Sunday morning. Such is
the underlying myth which supports the ritual commemoration
on Sunday.
<P>
We know how the authentic version of Mark ends abruptly
with the discovery of the empty tomb by the women who flee
in panic without telling any man of the miracle they have seen.
At a yet older stage in the formation of the Gospel it would seem
to have concluded with the centurion's confession of faith (xv,
39), the moment of Jesus' death being considered as also the
moment of his resurrection to glory and immortal life. But this
simple conception of his resurrection, which was certainly held by
the first believers, was presently deemed insufficient. The discovery
of the empty tomb was then imagined to provide a
material proof, the resurrection being now conceived under the
idea that the dead body of Jesus must have been re-animated and
delivered up <i>from a tomb</i> in which it had been immured for some
time. This materialized conception of the matter is pursued in the
<P>
<center>25</center>
<P>
other Gospels to the point of extravagance and in self-contradictory
forms, the material body of Jesus being endowed with the
immaterial quality of spirit, while the Christ is represented (in
Luke and Acts) even as taking part in the meals of the disciples.
In addition to this self-contradiction, Luke flatly contradicts the
stories in Matthew and Mark who place the first apparition of the
risen Jesus in Galilee. From all this the conclusion follows that
what we have here is not a historical tradition of a factual resurrection
which, after all, is not an observable fact of the physical
order, but an assertion of faith. The stories of imagined apparitions
are, for the most part, apologetic constructions for buttressing
belief by clothing it in material form. Whence it follows in this
crucial case, as in that of miracles in general, that the only history
we can glean from stories of supernatural magic is the history of
belief.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>THE CHRIST OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL</font></center>
<P>
The primary difference between the point of view of the fourth
Gospel and that of the Synopsis is that the Christ it presents is
not a human being raised above humanity by a Spirit emanating
from God, but a divine being <i>from the outset</i>, a hypostasis, an
original emanation, the transcendent Son, the Logos of God.
This Son or Logos is made manifest in the flesh that he may gather
believers, who, by true faith in him whom God has sent, will
themselves become God's children. The Son has neither father
nor mother in this world. Nevertheless, in his earthly manifestation,
he appears as the member of a family, is reputed son of
Joseph and has a mother and brothers. But the book, <i>in the form
in which it has come down to us</i>, seems to attribute to the Christ an
existence completely human, assigning him a real birth followed
by an integral human life up to the age of thirty after which his
ministry, as divine revealer of a mystery, begins and lasts for
about three years. Not only is this in violent and consciously
intended contradiction to the Synopsis but is an addition and a
contradiction to the fundamental idea of the fourth Gospel itself,
the idea namely of a divine incarnation for the manifestation and
fulfilment of human salvation, the said manifestation having no
need to pass through preparatory stages while concealed under a
developing human envelope.
<P>
<center>26</center>
<P>
It remains to add that, while the Johannine Christ is presented
as revealing and instituting the religion of spirit, he fulfils that
function exclusively by means of two revealing images, light and
life, which after all are sensible symbols, and by "signs" which
are not merely symbols but miracles, prodigies effected by supernatural
magic, intensified in narration to enhance the spiritual
lesson, which, on its side, tends to compromise the material
reality of the facts in the story. But their material reality is none
the less intended by the narrator. Thus: the Christ is the Light
of the world; proof, the miraculous cure of the man born blind:
the Christ is resurrection and life; proof, the raising of Lazarus
after four days in the grave. Both these marvels are presented as
factually occurring, and as leading up to the spiritual denouement.
The same method is applied in the presentation of the other
miracles.
<P>
The stories of the Passion and of the Resurrection are constructed
on a like principle. Although they have been retouched
to soften their profound and significant difference from the
synoptic presentation, the Johannine stories of these events were
originally written and still remain, under all that has been added,
in harmony with the primitive Easter observance, known as
quartodeciman, the Christ being deemed to have died on the
14 Nizan, on the day and at the very hour when the paschal lamb
was sacrificed. The contradiction of the Synoptics on this essential
cannot be resolved. Nor could the conflict as to the two observances,
which went on during the second century.
<P>
The divergence shows that both dates are commemorative.
Neither can pretend to indicate the chronological place of the
Passion. They are ritual conventions, not history. Both being
symbolic, and the one no more historical than the other, the
historian is under no obligation to choose between them. They
are mutually destructive.
<P>
Note further, on account of its importance, the incident of
the lance-thrust. This incident, though secondary, fictitious and
a late insertion into the story, is full of meaning. Not only is it
presented as the fulfilment of two prophecies, but the water and
blood that flow from the pierced side of Jesus are figures of the
sacraments of Christian initiation, baptism and the Supper, and
of the double witness of the Spirit, emitted in the last breath of the
<P>
<center>27</center>
<P>
Crucified. To find in the natural decomposition of blood an
explanation of a miracle and symbol so finely conceived, as some
would do, is an exercise of ingenuity in which only a blind
exegesis could indulge itself (John xix, 30-37; cf. vii, 37-39;
1 John v, 6-8).
<P>
The Johannine stories of the resurrection, which have been
worked over in successive revisions of the Gospel, are incoherent
and self-contradictory. They are out of harmony with the underlying
principle of the Gospel itself, according to which the Christ
returns to his eternal life, which had been interrupted, as it were,
by his temporal incarnation, with the last utterance of his expiring
breath. Incoherently with this spiritual conception, tradition
introduced a proof of material resurrection by proclaiming the
discovery of the empty tomb. Incoherently again, the Christ,
entering through closed doors as an immaterial spirit, proceeds
to show the disciples his material body scarred by the nails and
the lance, and the scene is repeated a second time to convince the
sceptical Thomas. Here is miraculous magic enough: but there
is more to come. A supplementary chapter (xxi) is given up to an
apparition in Galilee, doubtless derived from the oldest tradition
of the post-resurrection visions, in which the risen Jesus mingles
for a time in the daily life of his followers. But the end of the story
shows that the whole episode has been introduced for the purpose
of creating some sort of link between the glorious memory of
Peter, head-shepherd of the Christ's sheep, with that of the
beloved disciple of Jesus whom the churches of Asia venerated
as their supposed founder, the true and truthful author of the
Gospel in which these great marvels are reported. But the
Johannine Gospel, like the others, is so full of such marvels, and
in a sense fuller of fiction than they, that we cannot bind the
historian to accept all these operations of miraculous magic, as
real events irrefragably attested. They are constructed for a
purpose.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>THE TRUE SUPERNATURAL</font></center>
<P>
It would be idle to press further our proof of the presence in
the Bible, even in the New Testament, and in the Gospels, of a
supernatural magic unthinkable by contemporary intelligence. In
the supernatural so understood we have here no part or lot, for
<P>
<center>28</center>
<P>
the plain reason that it is untrue, that it crumbles to pieces, save
so far as it is held together by the ignorance of the believing
masses, and by the wilful blindness of the theologians who refuse
to see what is before them; nor can the suspicion be avoided that
these theologians sometimes play a part which ranges them with
opportunists, apologetic politicians, exegetical strategists, rather
than with those who really and personally believe in this false
supernaturalism, which they seem determined to impose as a
perpetual burden on the religious mind. We beg to tell them,
and to say it once for all, that their pretensions are preposterous
and their assumption of infallibility an unpermitted revolt against
exact knowledge. In the measure to which they condemn themselves
to follow their principle they deprive their works of all
claim to scientific value.
<P>
Let those who seek edification in such proceedings find the
edification they seek. Our own task is to establish the real
position of the biblical problem in our time, and to show the
place that remains for the true supernatural when the false supernatural
of magic and myth has been dismissed.
<P>
The problem before us is that of ascertaining, without exaggeration
and without reticence, the true place of Christianity in the
scale of religious values, taking full account of the development
in our time of the natural sciences, of our knowledge of the
universe, of anthropology, of human palaeontology, of historical
and pre-historical archaeology, of general history and the philosophy
of history, and of the knowledge of man himself. With an
urgency which no words can fully express we invite the theologians
of all the Christian confessions, and believers of every
religion in the world, to ponder the infinite perspectives which
now open before us on all sides and in presence of which all the
cosmogonies, all the mythologies, nay, all the theologies bequeathed
to us by antiquity vanish like the dreams of childhood.
<P>
Consider the immensity of the universe and the harmony of
its laws as now revealed to us; the mystery of infinite worlds
moving eternally on their way in the unfathomable depths of
space; consider the mystery of the atom, of the infinitely little,
each one a world and yet hardly perceptible to our senses,
enshrining in itself the mystery of the great universe, as it confronts
us in the life of every star and of all the stars in their
<P>
<center>29</center>
<P>
totality. In the presence of that what becomes of all the ancient
mythologies, including the biblical? In strictness of speech they
come to nothing. To be sure, the mystery of the universe does not
suppress the mystery of God, but intensifies it beyond measure
and shifts it to regions where all the old definitions of God
vanish like bursting bubbles. The idea of a completed and simultaneous
creation of all things등hat now becomes of that? What
madman in our days would dare to write down the age of the
universe in arithmetical figures? In the ages when the religions
of the world were born and their sacred books indited, barely a
suspicion had arisen of the mystery of the universe and the
mystery of God as they now confront us. An important fact in
itself and in its consequences.
<P>
That is not all. There is another mystery equally ignored by
all the religions in their sacred books, the mystery of man. On
this, as on the other, all they have to offer is fable, the work of
the imagination. Into the slow and painful ascent of man as he
rose from the animal condition to a growing consciousness of his
humanity, our vision now begins to penetrate, even to the
countless millenniums of his pre-history; even on the origins of
history a new light now begins everywhere to fall, and chiefly
on the ancient history of the neighbouring East where the
religion of Israel and the Christian religion had their birth. Of
this mystery, gradually disclosing itself to our astonished gaze,
the Bible, in truth, knows next to nothing. Israel and its God,
who became the Christian God, are late comers into human history
and into that of the Eastern Mediterranean; their sacred legend
is relatively recent, and, being a legend, cannot be fitted in with
the history, as now reconstructed, of the second millennium before
the Christian era and with that of the two or three preceding
millenia. Still less can it be fitted with the incalculable millenia
before history began, of which the legend knows nothing whatever.
In regard to the remote past of the human race, and to the
mysterious past of the universe, the legend hangs in air without
connection. It is no more a final revelation of the mystery of man
than of the mystery, unknown to it, of the universe, but goes on
its way without a suspicion of where the human mystery lies.
<P>
In the relations to both these mysteries the biblical legend is
the work of that fable-making faculty whose activities M. Berg-
<P>
<center>30</center>
<P>
son has lately described with so much perspicacity, though
without sufficiently insisting on the fact that fable-making is not
dead, but is still at work in all religions, and even plays a part, up
to a certain point, in the construction of all the philosophic
systems.
<P>
Need we add that Judaism and Christianity, originally as
limited in their outlook towards the future as in their consideration
of the past, cannot be accepted as a revelation, and a perpetually
valid and sufficient rule, of that religious and moral ideal towards
which humanity has never ceased to press forward through all
its many illusions and fallings away? The messianic expectations
in which Christianity had its birth were, so to say, a short-term
revolution of limited range alike in the world and the social
order. Here again we encounter an element of that false supernaturalism
from which neither Judaism nor Christianity felt any
need to shake itself free, although neither religion could grow, or
even hold its own, without progressively enlarging the scope of
its aspirations and hopes, as in fact they were constrained to do.
<P>
Contemplate these stupendous facts. Are they not enough, is
not their certitude sufficiently established, to justify the impartial
observer, who is also a man of goodwill, but intent on the truth
before and above all else, in asserting that the religious phenomenon
of Judaism and Christianity is not an absolutely unique
and incomparable fact of history, nor a primordial fact of history,
nor a fact fully realized in history, needing nothing to be added,
till our race, after an indefinite future, comes to its end? May he
not affirm that here is no revelation for all time given to humanity
in its cradle, fully complete at the outset and never since then
falling short of its plentitude, destined, in virtue of its initial
force, to guide humanity to the end of its evolution, an end
which none can foresee and is undisclosed by the revelation itself?
Be it said, quite simply, that Judaism and Christianity, taken
together, are not the revelation they have professed to be, but an
outstanding manifestation of religion, probably the most remarkable
humanity has produced.
<P>
Deeply considered, the real economy of the universe, of which
we now begin to get glimpses, is more marvellous than all the
old cosmogonies; and the real history of man is a revelation of
wonders greater than all the mythical schemes of salvation.
<P>
<center>31</center>
<P>
Does this imply that religion must now be imagined as having
no future on our planet? By no means. What has perished for ever
is the dominance, in the concept of religion, of the false supernatural.
In a sense, the Christian ideal has never been more
necessary, never more immediately applicable, than it is to the
movement of civilization in our time. What then is the Christian
ideal? It is expressed in the notion of the reign of justice, realized
or realizable by the law of love, the noblest ideal our minds
are capable of grasping, but presented in the Gospel, thanks to its
eschatological form, in Utopian colours and to be realized by
magic. It is expressed again in the notion of inward peace,
product of faith in the profound value of the regenerated soul, of
spiritual life under the law of justice and love, a notion found in
the writings attributed to Paul, but there presented in a form not
less mythical than in the heretical gnoses. Lastly it finds expression
in the vision of a universal society of believers, the true Catholic
Church, the common fatherland of souls, united in the practice
of justice under the law of love, the confident conviction and
clear consciousness that they are being born to a higher life
through the working of this sublime law; of all which traditional
Catholicism, with an imposed orthodoxy, a ruling hierarchy
and a papacy blindly imperialist, while professing to be a true
representation, is but a caricature.
<P>
The essence of Christianity may be found in this ideal, unrealized
though it has been at any period of Christian history;
nay, it is the essence of the religion of humanity, advancing to
perfection, with ever increasing promise, in a future to which no
limit can be assigned. But to look for a clear conception or express
formulation of it in the New Testament would be the most
childish of anachronisms. We find it there only in germ, embedded
in supernatural magic. But the germ was alive; there was already in
it a large measure of spiritual life, that is, of the true supernatural,
which must either grow and expand in the individual soul and
in society, or humanity will perish.
<P>
Just as the Christianity of old, in adapting its message to the
conditions of the Mediterranean world, impressed itself on that
age by bringing to it a human ideal far superior to that of the
pagan religions and the speculations of Greek wisdom, so it
behoves the followers of the gleam in our time, to free Christianity
<P>
<center>32</center>
<P>
from traditional fetters, to enlarge it to the dimensions of the
rightful aspirations and needs of civilization, to raise speculation
to the height of true science in all its findings, welcoming the
light from whatsoever quarter it may come. Above all the travail
of humanity, in the midst of which we are living, let the children
of the light proclaim on high the divine principle of love, of
devoted love, to the end that a religion may arise, crown of the
Christian religion and of every other, all taken up into one, and
concentrated on the perfecting of humanity in the life of the
spirit, that is, in communion with God.
