<title>The Origins of the New Testament: Chapter 7</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2><i>Chapter VII</i></h2></center>
<center>
<h2>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN</h2></center>
<p>WE have already unmasked the audacious literary fiction by means of which the
Gospel called John's was introduced to the Asiatic churches among which it was
first published and presented as embodying the only perfect type of Gospel
catechesis. Such a mode of presenting the book makes it clear that the intention
of its authors was not to complete the synoptic catechesis but to supplant it
outright, in which, however, this new catechesis did not succeed. It is equally
certain that the Johannine Gospel owed much, in its first form, to the Synoptics,
and that in order, at a later stage and in regions outside that of its origin,
to render it acceptable along with them, various additions were made to it with
a view to bringing it more into line with the books in opposition to which it
was at first brought out, and giving it a greater resemblance to them. The first
publication can hardly have been effected before 135-140; the additions and
retouches on synoptic lines will have been introduced soon afterwards when
Asiatic Christianity was uniting with that of other churches to make common
front against the flood of gnosticism and especially against Marcion. It is none
the less true that the fourth Gospel is, essentially, a gnostic document,
although its structure-form proclaims it a Christian catechism: moreover it has
absorbed a number of gnostic pieces, rhythmic utterances of mystic teaching,
originally composed outside the Gospel framework and incorporated with it by
methods to be indicated presently, just as the Synoptics have incorporated many
a fragment of the earlier eschatological teaching. The result is that the
Johannine catechesis is hardly less complex than the synoptic. We cannot claim
to untie all its knots. At least let us see what patient analysis of the book
will reveal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking it as traditionally constructed we can distinguish in it two principal
parts: first, the Epiphany of the Christ, as Logos or incarnate Son of God, in
his public ministry (i-xi); second, the preliminaries, teachings and
circumstances of his death and resurrection (xii-xxi).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">194</p>
<P>
<center><font size=+1>THE PROLOGUE: FIRST PHASE</font></center>
<p>Dissertation on the prologue to John, its origin, integrity
and relation to the body of the book, has been going on for a lone time and in
many quarters. Here we confine ourselves to a positive statement of what seems
to us most probable. Taken as tradition presents it (i, 1-18) the prologue is
not a part of the Gospel in the sense of a preface summarizing its theme, but a
deeply thought out explanation of what is to follow, and this explanation,
thrown into the form of a theological poem, may originally have existed
independently of the book to which it is now attached. This prologue, moreover,
in the canonical presentation of it, has been glossed and surcharged, as the
Gospel itself has also been in every one of its parts.

</p>
<p>The first strophe declares the origin, creative activity
and life-giving manifestation of the divine Logos (1-5; in 3-4 the logical and
rhythmical balance of the strophe requires the cutting of the lines thus:
&quot;And without him nothing has come into being. What has come into being, in
him was life. And the life,&quot; etc.). Our prologue thus announces itself at
the outset as, in substance, a piece of high gnosis, and a poem exactly
rhythmical in form. But what now follows immediately is not in perfect keeping
with this sublime beginning. At this point, and again later on, the sequence is
broken by reference to John the Baptist, two interpolations, each striking a
false note in the context and dislocating its primitive structure (6-8, 15-16).
The object of these intrusions is clearly that of conforming our Gospel to the
synoptic tradition freely interpreted in the sense of the Johannine gnosis. But
it would be grave error to suppose, as some have done, that the prologue was
originally concerned with John the Baptist himself. Whatever may have been said,
the Mandean texts 'furnish not the slightest support to such a conjecture. [1]

</p>
<p>It is in concrete terms that the author of the poem
describes the manifestation of the divine Logos, made flesh that he may gather
around him the children of God, these regenerated by the grace and truth which
Jesus Christ procures for his own, as Moses procured Law for the Jews. But the
gloss which brings John the Baptist into the poem is not solitary; others have
been practised. The line &quot;to those who believe in his name

</p>
<p>[1] See <i>Le Mandeism et les origines chretiennes</i> (27-46,
148-155).

</p>
<p align="center">195

</p>
<p>(12c) is an explanation co-ordinate to what follows in the
traditional text, &quot;they who are not born of blood,&quot; etc. At first
sight one sees no need to say that the children of God are not made such by
human generation: but the primitive reading is that known to Irenaeus and
Tertullian: &quot;He who was born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh
(nor of the will of man) but of God,&quot; the words &quot;nor of the will of a
man&quot; having been added to emphasize the miraculous conception of the
Christ, the original text simply stating that the Christ was born of God,
because the Logos had taken flesh to himself by a mode with which natural
generation had nothing whatever to do (cf. Jesus' reply to Mary, ii, 4 and
Hebrews vii, 3). After (i, 14): &quot;And the Word was made flesh and dwelt
among us&quot; the next words should be &quot;full of grace and truth&quot;
continuing with 16-17, and dropping &quot;we beheld his glory, as of the only
begotten son from the Father,&quot; the last a heavy handed and prosaic gloss.
Finally, the verse (i, 18): &quot;No man has seen the Father,&quot; etc., is a
theological gloss intended to explain how the Word-Son, as the sole master of
the mystery and the exegete of God, is able to bring grace and truth into the
world.

</p>
<p>Restored to its original form the primitive poem would read
as follows: [1]

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Au commencement etait le Logos,<br>
  et le Logos etait pres de Dieu,<br>
  et le Logos etait dieu.<br>
  Il etait au commencement pres de Dieu:<br>
  tout par lui s'est fait,<br>
  et sans lui ne s'est fait rien.<br>
  Ce qui s'est fait en lui fut vie,<br>
  et la vie etait la lumiere des hommes;<br>
  Et la lumiere dans les tenebres luit,<br>
  et les tenebres ne l'ont point saisie. [<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>]<br>
  La lumiere vraie,<br>
  qui eclaire tout homme<br>
  est venue dans le monde,<br>
  Dans le monde Il fut,<br>
  le monde (qui) par lui a ete fait,<br>
  et le monde ne le connut pas.

</p>
</blockquote>

here restored by M. Loisy, his version is presented in the original. The empty
brackets indicate the points at which the poem has been glossed or interpolated. Translator's
note.

</span>]

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John the Baptist has been surreptitiously introduced into
the prologue by way of preparing for his express testimony to the Christ. This
testimony is distributed over two major scenes (i, 19-28, 29-36) which are again
subdivided into smaller. The opening scene presents, first, the question of the
priests; then, the question of the Pharisees: the second contains, in the first
half, John's direct and express witness to &quot;the Lamb of God,&quot; whose
precursor he declares himself to be; in the second he claims to have seen the
Spirit descending upon him who baptizes in the Spirit. &quot;The Lamb&quot; must
have been consciously borrowed from the Apocalypse; in the final phase of the
Gospel we shall find the mystical relation of the Christ to the paschal lamb
clearly indicated. The utmost care is taken to avoid the statement that Jesus
was baptized by John, and the general outlines of the scene, in spite of
apparent precision in a few details, are wavering and uncertain. The indication
of the locality where John was then operating as &quot;Bethany beyond
Jordan&quot; has the look of affectation on the part of the narrator. He seems
to have known all the places he mentions, but it would be imprudent to conclude
that there is any historical warrant for localizing the Baptist at Bethany. Many
a marvel which never took place is localized by our narrator quite as minutely
as is the incident before us.

</p>
<p>Editorial artifice is not less apparent in representing the
first disciples of Jesus as sent to him by John; but the transition to the
stories (35-37) is unnatural and the indication of the return to Galilee (43) is
out of place. The disciples are called up on four

</p>
<p align="center">197

</p>
<p>occasions (35-39, 40-42, 43, 44-51), all four first
conceived as preliminary to the coming manifestation of the Christ in Galilee.
The anonymous disciple of the first vocation, discreetly associated with Andrew,
and won to the faith before Peter, is probably he who later on will be marked
out as &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved&quot; (xiii, 23). Peter, when his
turn comes, is nevertheless allowed a certain prominence, this being the
occasion on which Simon receives his surname, but without any indication of its
mystic meaning. The Philip, here honoured by a call confined to himself alone
(43), is probably the Philip of whom Asiatic Christianity retained some memory.
Nathanael, who receives a fuller notice than any of the others, is a person
unknown to the synoptic tradition.

</p>
<p>Were these stories taken as historical, or even as
pretending to be so, they would leave the reader with a hopelessly confused
impression. Andrew and his unnamed companion are represented as believing, on
the assurance of John the Baptist, that Jesus is &quot;the Lamb of God&quot;;
but Andrew's statement to his brother Simon is: &quot;We have-found the
Messiah&quot; (41) and Philip, speaking in the same sense, says to Nathanael
(45): &quot;we have found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the prophets, did
write; he is Jesus, son of Joseph, of Nazareth.&quot; And Jesus himself, when
his gift of second sight has caused Nathanael to recognize him as &quot;Son of
God, the King of Israel,&quot; declares that he is &quot;Son of Man&quot; (51):

</p>
<p>&quot;Verily, verily I say unto you, ye shall see the
heavens open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of
Man&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>— an assertion not
clearly made good in the sequel to the stories. Certainly the writer does not
wish it to be understood that Jesus was the real son of Joseph, nor that
Nazareth was his real birthplace. He merely accepts the synoptic interpretation
of the word &quot;Nazorean.&quot; The true definition of the Christ lies in his
qualification as Son of God in the transcendent sense established by the
prologue; all the rest is intended to convey that the Christ and the Son of Man
of the Synoptics are identified with this Son of God.

</p>
<p>The sons of Zebedee seem to have been forgotten in our
Gospel's account of the calling of the disciples, whence it follows that the
anonymous disciple, probably the well-beloved; is not, so far as that goes,
identified with the, apostle John. On the whole

</p>
<p align="center">198

</p>
<p>our compiler has not troubled himself to be complete in his
account of the vocations, for he seems -to suppose, from now on that Jesus has
around him the group of Twelve.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Miracle at Cana: the First &quot;Sign&quot;</b>

</p>
<p>All we have read up to this point is preparation for the
epiphany of the Christ, which begins in the miracle at Cana. To the commentators
who know exactly where Cana is to be found on the map we would say: enough if we
localize it as the place where Jesus first &quot;revealed his glory,&quot; so
that, from that moment &quot;his disciples believed in him.&quot; The epiphany
apparently takes place in a domestic circle; there is a marriage at Cana: the
mother of Jesus is there; Jesus arrives with his disciples; they are invited to
the feast; but there is no more wine. Jesus orders six urns, placed there for
Jewish purification, to be filled with water; the water is changed into wine;
and this is the first &quot;sign&quot; given by Jesus. Observe that the miracle
is a &quot;sign&quot;; for it is precisely in this that it diners from the same
prodigy when performed in the sanctuaries of Dionysus, from which our author has
borrowed it. What does the sign signify? The general meaning is that the economy
of the Law with its rules of outward purification must now give way to the
life-giving economy of faith in the immortal Christ, as symbolized in the
Christian sacrament.

</p>
<p>Let us pause to consider the feature of this
&quot;sign&quot; which, from the earliest time till now, has most disconcerted
the commentators. When Jesus and his disciples have taken their places among the
guests the wine has given out; the supply for the marriage is exhausted. Jesus'
mother then says to him, &quot;there is no more wine.&quot; Jesus replies,
&quot;Woman, what is there (in common) between me and thee? My hour is not yet
come.&quot; His mother says to the servants, &quot;do whatever he tells
you.&quot; Whereupon Jesus orders the urns to be filled and the miracle is
effected. What can we make of this? Taken one by one as they stand the
statements are incoherent and make up an unintelligible phantasmagory. But not
so when we consider the profound meaning of the whole presentation. The mother
of Jesus is not mentioned by her proper name; but the person designated is Mary
who is, apparently, Jesus' mother, just as Joseph has been previously

</p>
<p align="center">199

</p>
<p>named as, apparently, his father (i, 45). But this mother
stands also for the Judaism which waited for the Kingdom of God, and it is in
that character that she is made to declare &quot;there is no more wine.&quot;
Jesus begins by answering that between him and his putative mother there is
nothing in common, because there is nothing earthly in his origin; his hour,
which has not yet come, is the hour of his death, on which salvation depends.
None the less, he does, there and then, what he has been implicitly asked to do,
giving the lesson in the form of a symbol.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Second Sign: Expulsion of the Traders from the Temple</b>

</p>
<p>The second &quot;sign&quot; worked by Jesus is the
expulsion of the traders from the Temple (ii, 13-17). But before coming to it we
are told (12) that Jesus went down to Capernaum, he, his mother, his brothers
and disciples. This is the first mention of his brothers, which we might have
expected at an earlier stage; but we are beginning to understand that our
evangelist is engaged upon something very different from biography. At Capernaum
their stay has but a few days' duration because &quot;the Passover of the Jews
is at hand&quot; and Jesus will seize the opportunity to manifest himself in
Jerusalem. The idea is that the Christ will not preach in Galilee till after he
has preached in Jerusalem and in Judea. He is taken to Capernaum only for the
purpose of doing a measure of justice to the synoptic tradition (especially
Matthew iv, 13), and at the same time arranging a transition to the narrative
that follows. From now onwards it is apparent that our gospel editor takes the
line of restricting the ministry in Galilee that he may enlarge a ministry in
Jerusalem and Judea, which is almost entirely ignored by the synoptic
catechesis.

</p>
<p>As the author has previously used the expression &quot;the
purifications of the Jews,&quot; so now he speaks of &quot;the Passover of the
Jews.&quot; The reason is that his readers are Gentile Christians unacquainted
with Jewish customs, and that he himself looks upon Judaism from the outside as
one who himself is not a Jew. Moreover the object of Jesus in coming to
Jerusalem at the time of the Feast is, not so much to take part in it, as there
and then to &quot;manifest his glory.&quot; As the synoptic tradition sees in
the expulsion of the traders the first act of the messianic ministry in
Jerusalem, so our evangelist attaches it to Jesus' first stay in the 

</p>
<p align="center">200

</p>
<p>holy city. But he interprets it after his own manner, not
merely as an act of authority, but as a &quot;sign.&quot;

</p>
<p>Without pausing over details in the description of the
occurrence, let us fix attention on the passage most characteristic both of the
spirit of our Gospel and of its chronology (ii, 18-22 already quoted and
discussed, p. 60).

</p>
<p>The question here ascribed to &quot;the Jews&quot; after
the expulsion of the traders is the question which, in the Synoptics, is put to
Jesus by the elders of the Sanhedrim (Mark xi, 27-28; Matthew xxi, 23-24; Luke
xx, 1-2) combined with the demand for a sign in the same Gospels (Matthew xii,
38; cf. Mark viii, n; Luke xi, 16). In the Christ's reply as here given a sign
is actually offered, but one that would have been wholly unintelligible to his
audience, as indeed it has remained for many commentators. This reply is, in
effect, an enigmatic combination of Jesus' answer to the demand for a sign in
Matthew (xii, 39-40) with the saying of the Christ about the temple, brought up
against him in the synoptic account of the trial before Caiaphas (Matthew xxvi,
61; Mark xiv, 58). But here there is a difference in the phrasing. Instead of
&quot;I will destroy this temple,&quot; he now says &quot;destroy it,&quot; as
though challenging the Jews to destroy it themselves. For the temple of which he
now speaks is his own body. His answer is thus equivalent to the refusal of a
sign for the present and, for the future, to the sign of Jonah in the sense
given to it by Matthew {loc. cit.}. To discuss the verisimilitude of the reply
would clearly be quite superfluous, and equally so to discuss, from that point
of view, what the Jews answer about the forty-six years occupied by the
construction of the temple. In the final analysis, what the writer would here
convey is his conception of the age of the Christ, forty-six years when he
expelled the traders, forty-nine (completed) when he died, so that his jubilee
year would be that of his entry on the immortal glory awaiting him on his
resurrection (cf. supra., p. 61). The disciples themselves are described as
unable to find the key to this symbolic riddle till after the resurrection of
the Christ (22). We are, then, in presence of a second &quot;sign&quot; parallel
to the &quot;sign&quot; of Cana. Like the first, it figures the renewal of the
Covenant, substituting Grace for Law, and brought about by the death and
resurrection of the incarnate Son of God. Let who will believe that what is here
narrated really happened.

</p>
<p align="center">201

</p>
<p>The remark on the numerous conversions which Jesus made on
this occasion in Jerusalem and on the little value he attached to them, because
he knew what was in man (23-25), must be understood as referring to inadequate
faith or, rather, to a lower and Judaizing type of faith. This was probably
aimed originally at vulgar Messianism and the notion of the Kingdom of God as
purely terrestrial and eschatological. So understood the remark links on to the
case of Nicodemus and brings on the discourse supposed to have been addressed to
him.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Nicodemus</b>

</p>
<p>The case of Nicodemus (iii, 1-12) is imagined in order to
provide an apparently historical frame for the teaching about spiritual
regeneration which the Son, sent from God to save the world and not to judge it,
procures for the believer by baptism (5-6, 8, 11-13, 16-18). We find
accordingly that this teaching contains an implied criticism of the common
eschatology, even that of the Johannine apocalypse. The opening part has been
broken by interruptions in accordance with the narrative framework, which almost
have the effect of transforming this didactic poem into a dialogue between Jesus
and Nicodemus (7, 9-10, 14-15). We shall encounter other applications of the
same technique, by means of which interlocutors with Jesus are made to commit
blunders, or speak beside the point, in order to bring out the sequent
instruction. Nicodemus is a development of the questioner in the Synoptics who
asks Jesus what he must do to &quot;inherit eternal life.&quot; In the Synoptics
Jesus answers the question by laying down the moral conditions for admission to
the Kingdom of God; here, the Kingdom is an inward possession of the believer,
realized in the Church, to which the believer is initiated by a symbolic act
effecting the spiritual regeneration of the individual performing it, and in
keeping with the faith in him which the Son, come from God, claims for himself.
This lesson on regeneration by water and the Spirit is the first explanation of
the spiritual Gospel and comes in most aptly.

</p>
<p>We find the lesson completed by a second witness borne by
John the Baptist (iii, 26-36); it is the work of an editor, constructed by
transposing elements taken from the Synoptics (Matthew xi, 2-19; Luke vii,
18-35). The setting of the scene (22-26),

</p>
<p align="center">202

</p>
<p>in spite of its geographical precisions, is wholly
fanciful. But let the fact be noted that the writer finds it quite in order to
represent both Jesus and John as baptizing simultaneously and at no great
distance the one from the other. (An unconvincing attempt to put this right is
made later on (iv, 2) where we are told that Jesus did not baptize, but only his
disciples.) An altercation arising about the matter between John's disciples and
a Jew (a correction which makes nonsense; the original text was Jesus) the
disciples come to John to inform him of the proceedings of a rival Baptizer,
which they seem to regard as disloyal to him: whereupon John explains himself,
recalling his former witness and proclaiming the transcendent superiority of
Jesus (note in 28 the figure of the bridegroom and the best man at the wedding,
echo of Mark ii, 19-20; Matthew ix, 15; Luke v, 34-35). John's discourse has the
same look of planned construction, and of superposition, as the story
introducing it.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Woman of Samaria</b>

</p>
<p>From now onwards reference to John is incidental only (v,
33, 36; x, 40-41). Nevertheless the theme of water and the Spirit is not
abandoned, but is taken up again in the story of the Samaritan woman, where it
will be completed by the theme of the harvest (iv, 5-42). An artificial junction
links this episode to the Baptist's testimony (1-4); but the narrative, taken as
a whole, is not all of one piece. It looks as if an original story in which
Jesus and the woman were the only speakers had been subsequently enlarged by the
passages which refer to the disciples (iv, 8, 27, 31, 33, 37-38)? there are
signs also that, in order to harmonize with the present context, the primitive
itinerary which made Jesus pass through Samaria on his way from Galilee to
Judea, has been turned round and the whole episode antedated. The setting of the
scene is constructed with the same technique which set the scene for Nicodemus,
and the conversation proceeds by fits and starts, as these are prompted by the
irrelevant replies of the woman to Jesus' remarks. The main purpose is to
develop the mystic theme of living water, the gift of the Spirit, which is also
the gift of immortality, and, at the same time, to bring out the insignificance
of the common eschatology in presence of this mysterious truth: &quot;God is
Spirit and it is in Spirit and truth that

</p>
<p align="center">203

</p>
<p>worshippers must adore him&quot; (24). What is said about
the harvest (35-38) is an allegorical paraphrase of a synoptic saying (Matthew
ix, 37-38; Luke x, 2) combined with the Sower of the parable; those who
&quot;have laboured&quot; are Jesus and the apostolic generation; the reapers
are the evangelist's contemporaries. Needless to say, the conversion of the
Samaritans and of the Samaritan woman is no fact of history but a symbol of the
Gentiles converted to the Christian mystery.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>A New Series of &quot;Signs&quot;</b>

</p>
<p>After the first miracle at Cana Jesus returns to Jerusalem
and appears there as master of the Temple; after the second (revival of the
royal officer's son) he returns to the holy city to show himself master of the
Sabbath. The first cycle of miracles and discourses concerns the superiority of
Christianity, religion of Spirit, over Judaism, religion of ineffectual symbols;
the second cycle, which includes the cure of the royal officer's son, the cure
of the paralytic at Bethesda and the multiplication of the loaves, together with
discourses interpreting the last two (v, 19-46; vi, 22-71), will reveal Jesus as
the active principle and sustaining food of the true life. But first it is
necessary to bring Jesus from Samaria into Galilee.

</p>
<p>This change of place is an editorial device, the departure
being explained by the saying: &quot;prophet has no honour in his own
country,&quot; which comes from the Synoptics (Mark vi, 4; Matthew xiii, 57;
Luke iv, 24). But here it receives a particular application which many
commentators are slow to observe. Jesus has just been recognized as &quot;Saviour
of the &quot;World&quot; (42) by the Samaritans; but it is not in the order of
Providence that the glory of the Son of God, though revealed in the course of
his earthly existence, should be recognized before his death by all men on
Israelite territory, the exception of Samaria not destroying the rule.

</p>
<p>The new series of &quot;signs&quot; begins at Cana, where
Jesus, operating at a distance, cures the royal officer's son (46-54), a
transposition to Cana of the synoptic cure of the centurion's son (Matthew viii,
5-13) or servant (Luke vii, 1-10) at Capernaum. Instead of directly prefiguring
the conversion of the Gentiles, as in Matthew and Luke, the story here becomes a
lesson in the true

</p>
<p align="center">204

</p>
<p>kind of faith, that which believes on the strength of the
uttered •word, the characteristic faith of mystical Christianity which ought
to characterize the Gentile church, in contrast to the kind which demands
miracles.

</p>
<p>After curing the officer's son, Jesus leaves Cana and comes
to Jerusalem where he cures a paralytic on the Sabbath day (v, 1-18). By this
miracle an opening is made for a description of the life-giving work which the
Father has sent his Son into the world to accomplish (19-30). While invoking the
witness borne to him by the Father, Jesus reproaches the Jews for not hearkening
to what John has said of him and for paying no heed to what Moses has written
(31-47). All of it is legendary fiction, and cannot indeed be anything else. The
evangelist has two reasons for allotting so large a place to the Judean mission;
on the one hand, he is working a polemical theme against the Jews objecting that
Jerusalem is the true place of the prophets and of the Messiah's epiphany; on
the other, he partly dispossesses Capernaum in favour of Cana in order that
Jesus may not appear to have preached only in one little corner of Galilee.

</p>
<p>The text does not give the name of the feast for which
Jesus &quot;went up to Jerusalem,&quot; but calls it &quot;the feast of the
Jews,&quot; their feast par excellence, which can only have been the Passover.
Irenaeus says that this Passover is the second of three he has counted in the
public life of the Christ (Heresies, ii, 22, 4), and would hardly have been more
positive if he had actually read the word &quot;Passover&quot; in the passage
before us; perhaps that is what he did read. The chronological scheme of our
Gospel involves a total duration for Jesus' ministry, or epiphany, of three and
a half years, the messianic number (cf. supra, p. 60). This is why three
Passovers are indicated before that which coincides with his death: the first
follows the first miracle at Cana (ii, 13); we are now at the second; the third
will be mentioned in connection with the multiplication of the loaves (vi, 4).
The history of the text shows that, in order to bring John into line with the
Synoptics on this point, attempts were made to suppress both the second Passover
and the third. It is, however, true that the Johannine chronology is imaginary
and symbolic; but so is everything that it encloses. The paralytic miraculously
cured at the Pool of Bethesda is the paralytic of Capernaum symbolically 

</p>
<p align="center">205

</p>
<p>interpreted (cf. Mark ii, 9, ii; Matthew ix, 5, 6; Luke v,
22-24) and combined with the synoptic Sabbath story (Mark iii, 1-5; Matthew xii,
9-13; Luke vi, 6-11).

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Discourses following the &quot;Signs&quot;</b>

</p>
<p>The attitude of the Jews in presence of this violation of
the Sabbath corresponds to the conclusion of the Sabbath stories in the first
three Gospels (Mark iii, 6; Matthew xii, 14) but with an addition, entirely
Johannine in conception (v, 16-18), linked on to the declaration of Jesus about
the everlasting joint action of his Father and himself: &quot;for this cause the
Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the Sabbath, but
also said that his father was God, making himself equal with God.&quot; This
brings on the first instruction concerning the working of God, with the Son
working in conjunction. To this discourse a few additions have been made for the
purpose of somehow adjusting a mystical theory of salvation to the popular
conception of the Last Things, which the theory contradicts by suppressing it
(v, 22; 28-30, referring to a material resurrection, opening of tombs, etc., are
in contradiction with the texts which represent the resurrection as purely
spiritual).

</p>
<p>The second discourse (31-47), in which the witness of John
and of the Scriptures is evoked against the Jews, seems to be entirely of
secondary authorship. But it is possible that the passage: &quot;I am come in
the name of my Father and you receive, me not; if another comes in his own name,
him you will receive&quot; is aimed at the false Messiah Barkochba. In the
sayings attached to the Feast of Tabernacles (vii) there are some which relate
to the cure (v) of the paralytic (vii, 20-24, or rather 15-24, since 25 is
exactly in sequence to 14). A transposition has obviously taken place in the
text. The fact is that while the fourth Gospel, at one stage of its compilation,
was constructed on an orderly plan, there has been considerable dislocation of
the plan in subsequent redaction.

</p>
<p>The sixth chapter is dominated throughout by the idea of
the Christ as bread of life; the multiplication of loaves (1-14) is the symbol
of it; the miracle of Jesus walking on the sea (16-21) is an aid to its
comprehension; the, four discourses that follow (22-40, 41-51, 52-59, 66-71)
explain it more fully. The different

</p>
<p align="center">206

</p>
<p>impressions produced on the Jews by each of these
discourses represents the Jewish attitude towards the mystery of salvation in
contrast to the Christian. The general effect is to brine the mystery to summary
form in the doctrine of the living and lifegiving bread and in the corresponding
sacrament.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Bread of Life</b>

</p>
<p>The setting for the multiplication of the loaves is copied
from the Synoptics (Matthew xiv, 15; cf. Mark vi, 33) but combined with the
scene of the Discourse on the Mountain in Matthew the miracle itself being
constructed so as to symbolize the new faith and the mystery of salvation. The
reason for saying &quot;the Passover of the Jews was at hand&quot; is that the
multiplication of the loaves, already a figure of the eucharist in the synoptic
account, is going to be presented in the same way in the coming discourse on the
bread of life, and that a reminder of the Passover is a fitting introduction to
the eucharistic symbolism about to be presented. Fundamentally, this is the
place at which our Gospel places the institution of the Supper, the eucharist
being considered throughout by the evangelist as a mystery which ought not to be
offered to his readers in the direct terms used in First Corinthians (xi) and in
the Synoptics.

</p>
<p>The story of the miracle is also borrowed from the
Synoptics but with a few added touches to adapt it to the Johannine conceptions;
notable is the personal intervention of Philip and Andrew, whom we know already
in the vocation stories (i, 40, 43), and in a conclusion all its own. The crowd,
impressed by the miracle, conclude that Jesus is the Messiah and are about to
carry him off and make him King: but Jesus gives their enthusiasm no countenance
and withdraws out of their reach. In this both Jewish Messianism and the common
eschatology of the Christians are implicitly condemned.

</p>
<p>In the miracle of the Christ walking on the water we find
the same free and symbolic adaptation of what the Synopsis has to tell (Matthew
xiv, 22-27, 32-33; Mark vi, 45-52). The lesson is that the immortal Christ will
never abandon his own, all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.

</p>
<p>By an obviously forced transition the crowd, which had been
the witness and beneficiary of the multiplied loaves, is brought 

</p>
<p align="center">207

</p>
<p>back to Jesus, on the following day, to hear his discourse
on the bread of life (vi, 22-58). In its original form the discourse is a
didactic poem, like the discourse to Nicodemus, and quite as easy to reconstruct
if we eliminate the interplay of dialogue, which breaks the poem at several
points (28-31, 34, 41-42, 510-52), and omit a special instruction on
predestination which someone has tried to incorporate into the main discourse,
an interpolation made in order to affirm the resurrection of the dead (end of
verses 39, 40, 44). Moreover it is clear enough that the last strophe of the
poem (to be extracted from 53-58, dropping &quot;I will raise him up at the last
day&quot; in 54 and 58) has been added to introduce the sacramental system taken
by the synoptic tradition from First Corinthians (xi, 24-25), the symbolism,
namely, of the bread-body and the wine-blood of the Christ.

</p>
<p>Like the end of the discussion, the end of the story which
frames it (59-71) is also editorial work. The intentions behind it are various;
to soften down the hardest sayings of the discourse, in the last strophe, by an
explanation which emphasizes their spiritual character (61, 63); [1] to create
the opportunity for Peter's confession, imitated from the Synoptics but with a
Johannine interpolation (Matthew xvi, 16; Mark viii, 29; Luke ix, 20), and to
make room for the first denunciation of the traitor Judas (64-65, 70). The whole
is intended to bring out the blindness of the Jews and of certain Judaizing
Christians in presence of the mystery just explained. Even Judas is not, as some
would have us think, an individual traitor on whom the apostle John vents his
spite. He personifies the Jews' hatred of Jesus and of Christianity.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">SECOND PHASE</font>

</p>
<p>The scene for the second phase of the Christ's combat with
the Jewish enemy is laid exclusively in Jerusalem and covers the last year of
Jesus' ministry. The events and discourses of chapter vi having been dated with
reference to the Passover at the beginning of this final year, those which fill
the five chapters to follow, and end at the great Passover coincident with the
Passion, fall into two groups attached for their placing to two intermediate
festivals, that of Tabernacles and that of the Dedication. De-

</p>
<p>[1] Verse 62, asserting the bodily ascension of the
&quot;Son of Man&quot; is a gloss.

</p>
<p align="center">208

</p>
<p>pendent on the first are some polemic discourses and the
cure of the man born blind, with the discourse that follows it (x, 1-21) the
whole dominated by the idea of the Christ as light of the world. The second
group marks the definite breach between the Christ and the Jews (x, 22-42).
Before the last Easter will come the raising of Lazarus, symbol of the
Christ-life and greatest &quot;sign&quot; of all.

</p>
<p>The preamble (vii, 1-13) introducing this second series of
doings and teachings is deeply confused. Jesus abstains from going about in
Judea because the Jews are resolved to kill him and confines himself to Galilee;
the Feast of Tabernacles coming round, his brothers, who however do not believe
in him, urge him to go to Jerusalem and reveal himself there as what he pretends
to be; Jesus refuses, alleging that his hour is not yet come; his brothers then
depart for the Feast; he follows them incognito; goes up to the temple in the
midst of the solemnities and begins to teach. The opening of the preamble is
based on the cure of the paralytic at the Pool of Bethesda (cf. v, 16-18), but
the dialogue with the brothers, parallel to the remarks exchanged between Jesus
and his mother at Cana, suggests that Jesus is about to show himself at
Jerusalem for the first time. His brothers, moreover, personify incredulous
Judaism. Instead of vainly speculating on the meaning of it all, we are content
to remark once more that our Gospel must have been worked over more than once
before assuming its final form. Let it be remembered also that the first words
of the preaching attributed to Jesus in vii, 15-24 need to be placed at the end
of the story of the paralytic in v.

</p>
<p>The preamble analysed in the last paragraph introduces the
discussion, which is placed further on (vii, 25-36), concerning the origin of
Jesus, where an answer is given to an objection from the Jews. Their objection
is that everybody knows where Jesus comes from, whereas, when Messiah shall
appear, nobody will know his place of origin. Jesus answers that the Jews are
under a great illusion in thinking they know that he comes from Nazareth and is
the son of Joseph; he alone knows whence he came and who sent him. (A certain
kind of critical benevolence must be applied to the matter if we are to overlook
the plain contradiction of the birth stories in Matthew and Luke conveyed by
these

</p>
<p align="center">209

</p>
<p>statements.) Duplicates are not wanting in these chapters
(vii and viii), for example, the discussion on the presumed origin of the
Christ, the Jews maintaining that he was not to come from Galilee but from
Bethlehem in Judea and would belong to the race of David (vii, 40-52), which
takes us over the same ground as vii, 26-38 and implicitly repeats the
contradiction of the birth stories in the Synoptics and, again, the repetition
of the attempts to take Jesus prisoner, and each time with no success (vii, 30,
44; viii, 20, 59). Found anywhere else than in a book we are accustomed to
venerate, and is truly worthy of veneration in many parts of it, these
wranglings about the origin of the Christ would impress us as a rather tiresome
academic exercise. They are the echoes of ancient controversies between
Christians and Jews.

</p>
<p>An editorial hand has inserted into the text a passage
(vii, 37-39) which it is important to note, not only on account of its
correspondence with another insertion into the story of the Passion (xix,
31-37), but also because it is seldom rightly understood. The passage should
read as follows:

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now on the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood
forth, and cried, saying:<br>
If any man is athirst, let him come to me,<br>
and let him drink, him who believes in me,<br>
According as Scripture has spoken,<br>
Rivers of living water shall flow out of his belly.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In applying this quotation (Zechariah xiii, i; xiv, 8) to
the believer, the writer introduces a gross and incongruous image. And the more
incongruous inasmuch as Jesus alone, and not the believer, can be thought of as
the source of the water of life. The writer is referring to the water that burst
from the side of Jesus at the stroke of the soldier's lance, and accordingly
takes pains to tell us (39) that the living water is the Spirit, to be given to
believers when Jesus has entered into his glory. [1]

</p>
<p>Another interpolation which has no connection whatever with
the evolution of the written Gospel is the section known as the story of the
woman taken in adultery. It belongs to the late history of the Greek text and
falls outside the scope of our present

</p>
<p>[1] For the full discussion of this passage, which has many
important bearings, see Le Quatrième Evangile, 270-273.

</p>
<p align="center">210

</p>
<p>inquiry. Deliberately banished from the synoptic tradition,
of which the story is a lost fragment, it has got itself, by the strangest of
accidents, here tacked on to the Johannine Gospel (vii, 53-viii 11). [1]

</p>
<p>Immediately following this intrusion, Jesus' controversy
with the Pharisees resumes its broken course. He now answers the last objections
raised in vii, 41, 52, although, if strict regard be paid to the ever changing
mise en scene, it would seem that he cannot have heard them. After declaring
himself &quot;the light of the world,&quot; he defies his adversaries, telling
them that he alone knows whence he comes and whither he goes, while they know
nothing of either. By this he means that he comes from God and returns to God.
Declarations of this kind afford a sure starting point for determining the
conditions of his epiphany as the Christ, both as to its opening and its close,
it will be seen that they exclude both an earthly existence before epiphany and
a corporeal resurrection after death. Needless to say his auditors understood
not a word of it (viii, 12-29).

</p>
<p>Close attention should be paid to the following (viii,
28-29) :

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When ye have lifted up the Son of Man,<br>
then shall ye know what I am,<br>
And that of myself I do nothing,<br>
but even as the Father has taught me,<br>
so speak I;<br>
And he who sent me is with me;<br>
He forsakes me not,<br>
because what is pleasing to him, that do I.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be an intentional contradiction of the saying<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>— a quotation from Psalm xxii, 1 — which Mark (xv, 34) makes into the
dying outcry of Jesus, and which might easily be misunderstood (cf. supra, p.
168). Whence we may infer that the passage is a late development in the text.

</p>
<p>In the final phase of this dispute (viii, 20-59) a
discourse on Jesus' Father, who is God, and the Jews' father, who is the Devil
(viii, 26, 38, 42-47, 54-55), seems to have been broken up by the compiler and
the interstices filled with an unrelated argument about Abraham (30-37,
39-41,48-53, 56-58). In connection with Abraham comes the indication about the
age of Jesus (57); 

</p>
<p>[1] See op. cit., 278-286.

</p>
<p align="center">211

</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art not yet fifty years old, and thou hast seen
Abraham!&quot;

</p>
<p>(An ancient variant reads: &quot;Abraham has seen
thee.&quot;) The fact is not without significance that this indication of Jesus'
age is found in an editor's addition and not in a fundamental document.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Light of the World</b>

</p>
<p>On leaving the temple, where the Jews had tried to stone
him, Jesus reveals himself as &quot;light of the world&quot; by curing a man
born blind, a &quot;sign&quot; which brings out the spiritual blindness of the
Jews (ix). The interrogation of the man's parents is possibly interpolated into
the original story of the miracle (ix, 18-23). A man born blind makes a suitable
figure of humanity ignorant of the blessings of revelation, but the Johannine
story aims primarily at intensifying the cure of blind men localized by the
Synoptics in Galilee and at Jericho; moreover this evangelist times the miracle
on a Sabbath day. The Pharisees, spiritually blind, as usual represent Judaism
in its unbelief of the Christian gospel. But the last lines &quot;for judgment I
came into this world,&quot; etc., are the compiler's addition. There has been
nothing to raise the question of &quot;judgment&quot; in the proper sense of the
word; but in any case the Christ, as we have already been told, did not come
&quot;to judge the world, but to save it&quot; (iii, 17-18).

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Good Shepherd</b>

</p>
<p>The poem of the Good Shepherd (x, 1-18) must at first have
existed independently and without connection with the story of the blind man.
Verse 6, to the effect that the audience did not understand what Jesus was
saying, is a compiler's invention together with verse 7, which takes up the
broken thread of the poem:

</p>
<p>other additions are the lines about the Christ as the Door
(9: the original must have been: &quot;I am the shepherd of the sheep&quot;);
and the verses on the sheep outside the fold who must be brought into the flock
(16). The question has often been raised as to the identity of the false
shepherds who came &quot;before&quot; Jesus and are here stigmatized as
&quot;thieves and brigands&quot; (8). Is the reference to Moses and the
Prophets? If so, would it here be said &quot;that the sheep heeded them not at
all&quot;? Nothing is gained by the omission, found in certain texts, of the
words &quot;before me&quot;; that only leaves the assertion vaguer than before
and does nothing to

</p>
<p align="center">212

</p>
<p>answer the question. The Jewish teachers, then; or the
false Messiahs? More probably the reference is to the spiritual powers which
have hitherto taken part in governing human affairs but have not succeeded in
seducing the children of God. And is there no connection with the mystical
shepherd — allegory in Zechariah xi, 4-17; xiii, 7-9? The question remains. A
piece of narrative is added (19-21) to complete the framework intended to link
these events and discourses with the Feast of Tabernacles.

</p>
<p>Three months afterwards comes the Feast of Dedication, and
Jesus is in the midst of the solemnities. After defining once more his role of
saviour of all predestined to salvation he is again threatened with stoning
(22-31). He explains why he has the right to call himself the Son of God, and
then evades further persecution by retiring beyond Jordan (40-42). What we are
told as occurring at the Feast of Dedication forms the conclusion of the
controversies that have gone before: the preamble (22-24) is certainly the
compiler's work, and Jesus' words about the sheep who give heed to his voice and
will never perish seem to have been originally the last strophe of the
allegorical poem of the Good Shepherd (x, 25; starting from &quot;the works that
I do&quot; but without &quot;I and the Father are one,&quot; (30) added to make
transition to the attempt at stoning).

</p>
<p>The argument by which Jesus is made to justify his claim to
divinity is the compiler's argument. Its defence of the saying &quot;I and the
Father are one&quot; is remarkable rather for subtilty than for exactitude
(31-39). It ends in another attempt of the Jews upon Jesus' person and by
another escape from their clutches (39).

</p>
<p>The account of Jesus' retreat into Perea (40-42) may be
part of the frame within which the story of the resurrection of Lazarus was
originally enclosed, but it has been glossed by the lines which refer to John
and to the numerous conversions effected by Jesus. These believers beyond the
river are another figure, after their kind, of the diffusion of the Gospel
beyond the borders of Israel. When the writer of this passage makes the Jews say
&quot;John gave no sign,&quot; it is because he found no miracle of John's
described in the Synoptics. But he has overlooked the passage where we are told
that the tetrarch Antipas, on hearing about the miracles of Jesus, immediately
made the comment: &quot;Here is John risen from the dead,&quot; which leaves no
doubt that miracles analogous

</p>
<p align="center">213

</p>
<p>to those of Jesus were attributed to John. It would indeed
be surprising if it were not so.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Raising of Lazarus</b>

</p>
<p>And now, at last, the greatest of all the miracles recorded
in the Gospels, the resurrection of Lazarus, supreme revelation of the Christ
who is life (xi, 1-14), encounters the full intensity of Jewish unbelief and
brings on the final catastrophe. The high priests and the Pharisees — such,
according to our Gospel, is the composition of the Sanhedrim — resolve to put
Jesus to death as the only way to prevent the conversion of the people; and
Jesus, whose hour is not yet come, goes into hiding, awaiting the time of the
Passover, the hour decreed by Providence as the termination of his existence on
earth (xi, 1-57).

</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that this distinctively Johannine
&quot;sign&quot; is charged with the maximum of symbolic meaning, attained by
concentrating and intensifying the resurrection of Jairus' daughter and of the
young man at Nain (Mark v, 35-42; Luke vii, 11-17). Our Lazarus has a
resemblance to Simon the Leper (Mark xiv, 3); but we have already seen {supra, p.
162 ) that the Lazarus of Luke's parable (xvi, 19-31) is rather dependent upon
him. The two sisters in Luke (Martha and Mary, x, 38-42) are turned by the
compiler into sisters of Lazarus; Mary, as a further improvement, is substituted
for the sinful woman of Luke (vii, 37-38) and for the woman of the anointing in
Mark and Matthew. But these combinations, which have sorely taxed the ingenuity
of commentators, were not all effected at a single stroke. At the very outset (xi,
1-2) the text is visibly glossed by the notice about the sisters, whose role in
the story is largely superadded to the original.

</p>
<p>The original version seems to have contained the message of
&quot;the sister&quot; announcing the sickness of Lazarus (xi, 3); Jesus'
comment on the sickness (4); the announcement that he would go to Judea, with
the disciples' objection and the Christ's reply (7-10); the dialogue between
Jesus and &quot;the dead man's sister&quot; (21-27), Jesus having arrived not
four days after the interment, but at the moment when the funeral was just over;
Jesus weeping with the other mourners (33, omitting his indignant groan); the
visit to the tomb and the order to remove the stone (34-39,

</p>
<p align="center">214

</p>
<p>again omitting the repeated indignation and Martha's remark
about the condition of the corpse); the removal of the stone, Jesus' prayer and
the resurrection of the dead man (41-44). The later additions aggrandize the
miracle, but give it the mechanical turn characteristic of supernatural magic.

</p>
<p>The essence of the matter lies, not in the miracle as such,
but in the truth it offers to belief, truth which the miracle is intended to
drive home and make good. Nothing else really counts. The work of raising a dead
body to life is but the guarantee of a work with importance of another and
higher kind, the universal and final work of raising humanity to life in the
Spirit. The resurrection of Lazarus, as it was originally conceived, was not
intended either to announce or prefigure the bodily revival of all the dead, but
as symbolic testimony to the spiritual resurrection, the eternal life of all who
believe. Observe that not a word is said as to what became of Lazarus after he
was loosed from his grave clothes and &quot;let go&quot; (44). The reason is,
that in this miracle, as indeed in many another already encountered, the reader
is invited to carry his vision beyond earthly contingencies and find in higher
truth the conclusion of which the story itself seems to stop short. And what is
the conclusion here? It is that whosoever believes in Jesus is in present
possession of eternal life; he has escaped from a house of death to which he
will never return; he is &quot;let go&quot; for unceasing advance, in light and
life, to God, heaven and everlasting glory; and humanity, regenerated in like
manner by the ever-living Christ, and so made the true Jerusalem of earth,
begins to mingle with that eternal Jerusalem into which it will be wholly merged
at the end.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Sequel to the Great Miracle</b>

</p>
<p>What we read of the effect of the miracle and the
information laid before the Pharisees (46) may come from the source (omitting
&quot;which came to Mary&quot; in 45), together with the notice of the Pharisees
laying plans to put Jesus to death (53). But the deliberations of the Sanhedrim
and the unwitting prophecy of Caiaphas (47-52) are editorial supplements. So,
too, are the words &quot;high priest for that year&quot; which suppose that the
Jewish high-priesthood was an annual office, like that of the Asiatic bishops,
and involves an error about the conditions under which Caiaphas

</p>
<p align="center">215

</p>
<p>held the pontificate (cf. supra, p. 151). The retreat of
the Christ to the town called Ephraim (.?) and the conversations of the Jews
waiting for his arrival at the Passover duplicate his previous retreat into
Perea after curing the man born blind (x, 40-41), and the remarks of the Jews
who waited for him at the Feast of Tabernacles. It would seem that the
source-account placed a very short interval between the resurrection of Lazarus
and the Passover, and that it kept Jesus at Bethany, because the Passover was
approaching and his hour at hand.

</p>
<p>The anointing in the house at Bethany is a symbolic prelude
to the death of the Christ (xii, 1-8); the triumphal entry into Jerusalem (9-19)
prefigures the glorious issue of his departure from the visible world; his last
discourses forecast its results — the conversion of the Gentiles (20-36) and
the reprobation of the Jews (37-50). The accounts of the anointing and of the
triumph are fragments of the synoptic tradition, here transposed and turned in
the Johannine sense by the same hand which added its supplements to the raising
of Lazarus. Mark (xiv, 1; cf. Matthew xxvi, 2) places the anointing two days
before the Passover; this writer says &quot;six days before,&quot; doubtless for
some symbolic reason; the sixth evening before the Passover would be that of the
Sabbath before the Passion in correspondence with the Sabbath of interment, the
triumphal entry next day (9 Nizan) thus anticipating the triumphal resurrection
of the following Sunday. The accusation of theft lodged against Judas (4-6)
replaces the betrayal for money in the Synoptics; when the hour comes for Jesus
to suffer himself to be arrested, there is no bargain between the Jewish priests
and the traitor, as in the Synoptics, but Satan informs them by the mouth of
Judas where they can find and capture him. The qualification of Judas as a
robber indicates the length to which the writer is willing to go in utilizing
the synoptic tradition about him; but his putting Judas in charge of the
alms-bag, in analogy with a practice of the early Christian communities, must
surely be an anachronism. Notwithstanding the efforts made to bring the
messianic triumph somehow into sequence with the raising of Lazarus, it is
doubtful whether this piece of the synoptic catechesis (the triumph) belonged to
the original economy of our Gospel.

</p>
<p>Of secondary authorship also is the discourse in the temple

</p>
<p align="center">216

</p>
<p>which Jesus is made to deliver about the Greeks, or
Gentiles who ask to see him (20-36). Noteworthy features are the artificiality
of the preamble, in which Philip and Andrew again appear and the curious
transposition into the middle of the discourse (27-30) of a sublime equivalent
for the synoptic scene in Gethsemane. In this equivalent the Christ's prayer is
transformed from the synoptic version, in which he prays to be saved from the
fate awaiting him, into a distinct refusal so to pray; instead of so praying he
calls upon God to glorify his name. This better befits the Johannine conception
of the Christ. After that, in place of the consoling angel in Luke (xxii, 43),
comes a voice from heaven echoing the voices of the baptism and the
transfiguration in the Synoptics. This miraculous interlude is not for the
encouragement of the Christ, who is above all such needs, nor for the crowd who
are pictured as not understanding it, but for the education of the Christian
reader. The last discourse to the Jews is symbolic throughout. It is followed by
a last disappearance of Jesus into hiding (36). In manner like to his
disappearance, the light of the Gospel, offered to the Jews, will pass away from
them into Gentile possession. Such is the design of Providence, and the Jews are
powerless to hinder it.

</p>
<p>A yet later and, if possible, a more unreal addition is the
afterthought conclusion of the Jerusalem ministry (37-50), in which the compiler
makes Jesus deliver a new discourse (44-50), after the Christ has been finally
withdrawn from his incredulous audience. This discourse (to which 24-25, 31-32,
35-36 in the previous discourse seem originally to have belonged) may have been
found ready-made and here utilized by the same editor who applies the text from
Isaiah (vi, 9-10) to the reprobation of the Jews at the moment when the Christ's
ministry among them comes to an end (39-41). The same use of this text is made
by the Synoptics in connection with parables (Mark iv, 12; Matthew xiii, 14-15;
Luke viii, 10) and the compiler of Acts gives it the same application at the end
of his book (xxviii, 26-27. For the quotation in xii, 38 of Isaiah liii, 1, cf.
Romans x, 16).

</p>
<p>So ends the Johannine account of Jesus' ministry.
Everything
in it is governed by symbolism which all the circumstances are

</p>
<p align="center">217

</p>
<p>constructed to suit without regard to the consistency of
the narrative. The discourses, moreover, are surcharged with repetitions
revealing the anti-Jewish bias which so often inspires the editorial elaboration
of the source. The original miracle stories all betoken the spiritual work of
Jesus which the original discourses proceed to explain. The editors, elaborating
the original, have striven to show that the Jews understood nothing of the
mystery of salvation and the spirituality of the Gospel: accordingly they kill a
Messiah whose greatness is beyond them, and whom the death they inflict upon him
renders back to the eternal glory whence he came, and so makes him the saviour
of the world.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">THE CYCLE OF THE PASSION</font>

</p>
<p>The second part of our Gospel presents the Christ's role of
Saviour, the conditions in which he is to exercise it and those which he laid
down as the foundation of the Christian community. The conversations at the last
supper reveal to the disciples how salvation is ordered and the glory to come,
together with the law of love by which they are bound for ever to the immortal
Christ. This law is first illustrated by washing the disciple's feet (xiii,
1-17); it is there expressly promulgated (31-35) and placed between two
predictions; the first declaring the treachery of Judas and pointing out the
beloved disciple (23-26); the second announcing Peter's denial (36-38). The
Christ proceeds to exhort his faithful ones, promising them a place in his
Father's house, assuring them of his continued presence, even of his and the
Father's immanence in them (xiv, 1-14, 18-24, 27-28). In the midst of it all he
breaks in with a double promise of the Holy Spirit which the Father, in his
name, will send them (15-17, 25-26). The preamble to the washing of feet (xiii,
1-3) appears to have been retouched and surcharged. What is this supper,
&quot;after&quot; which the washing takes place? The original author probably
gave at this point an account of the last meal; this has been suppressed,
because a second writer, under the influence of the Synoptics, had introduced it
already (xii, 1-8) in the story of the anointing. Doubtless the original account,
which we are bound to believe underlies all this, seemed too unorthodox to be
retained. The washing of feet, so ill-placed that its character 

</p>
<p align="center">218

</p>
<p>as a surcharge can hardly be mistaken, [1] must belong to
an intermediate account into which interpolations have later been introduced,
this version being related by its principle idea and the subtilty of its
symbolism to those parts of the first Johannine Epistle which speak of
purification from sin by the blood of the Christ (i John ii, 2; iii, 5; iv).
Thus the washing of feet, in its character as memorial of the Christ as a
servant, living and dying with those who were his own, must have been
substituted in an earlier version for the symbolic distribution of bread and
wine, that is, for the eucharistic symbols. For that reason the washing is said
to be a repetitive completion of the essential purification realized once for
all in baptism (6-10).

</p>
<p>There are details in the story which would be quite
unintelligible if we failed to take account of the profound meaning which
attaches to the scene as it is described, not only as a whole, but in the
details also. In reality the &quot;service&quot; which the Christ is rendering
to his own is that of his death, of which the eucharistic love-feast is a
figure; and for that reason Peter's opposition to the act which Jesus would
perform (6-7) is the equivalent of the attitude assigned him by the Synoptics at
the first announcement of the Passion (Mark viii, 32-33; Matthew xvi, 22-23). In
like manner the reply of Jesus, &quot;if I wash thee not, thou hast no part in
me,&quot; is a defiance of all probability unless we understand the symbolism of
it. Is Peter, then, to be damned because he has refused to have his feet washed
by Jesus? The words refer directly to the Christian mysteries, baptism and the
eucharist, both regarded as necessary for salvation, both inseparable from the
unique symbol of life-giving water and from the unique idea of salvation
procured by Jesus in the death by which he became alive for ever. There is no
question here of overcoming the personal repugnance of Peter to having his feet
washed by Jesus. The matter in hand is to combat the Jewish Messianism in the
words attributed to Peter, which imply that he would not have Jesus lower
himself to the service of a life-giving death; to which Jesus replies that by
this service the sanctifying rites which

</p>
<p>[1] Normally ablutions of this kind took place before the
meal. But from the moment that the washing was made into an eucharistic symbol,
it had to be presented as a pendant to the meal or, better, after it. Some
manuscripts read &quot;a meal taking place,&quot; others &quot;a meal having
taken place&quot;; the first reading, seemingly a correction to avoid
contradicting what follows in xiii, 21-30 where the meal is still in progress.

</p>
<p align="center">2l9

</p>
<p>unite the Christian to the source of life are guaranteed as
permanently efficacious. Already, in earlier passages of our Gospel, baptism and
the eucharist have been proclaimed as necessary to salvation (vi, 53); so far is
the Johannine Christ from being indifferent to these sacred and efficacious
symbols. His interest in them is entirely natural. He is himself, by the
definition given of him, a kind of living and ever-active sacrament and, along
with this, a Master of Mystery and a God to be worshipped.

</p>
<p>The following sayings, attributed to Jesus either during
the meal or after it, and all of high mystic significance, may be considered as
coming from the fundamental account: xiii, 31-32, God is about to glorify his
Son; xiv, 1-3, the Son goes to prepare for his own a place near the Father; 6-7,
he himself is way, truth and life; whoso knows him knows the Father and has seen
him; 10-13 (after &quot;the words which I speak unto you&quot;) his works are
the Father's works and whoso believes in him will do the same, and yet greater
works, because the Son goes to the Father and will do all that is asked of him;
19-21, 23-24, soon the world will see the Son no more, but those who love him
and keep his commandments will see him; the Father and the Son will make their
abode in them, for the word of the Son is that of the Father.

</p>
<p>These instructions are, at the outset, twice interrupted by
compilers' additions regarding the treachery of Judas in xiii, lo-n (after the
words &quot;and you are clean&quot;) and in 18-19. It might seem that the
betrayal is here brought in for the purpose only of maintaining the atmosphere
of darkness and death which envelops the last meal of the Christ with those who
loved him; that may be so, but the writer will not lose the opportunity to
recall that Jesus knew all that was in store for him; moreover the felony of
Judas had been foretold in prophecy, and Jesus must cite the Scripture which
announces' it (Psalm xli, 9). Of secondary origin also are the sentences, (xiii,
12-17, 20) borrowed from the synoptic tradition (cf. Matthew x, 24, 40; Luke vi,
40), the connection of which with the mystic example of the washing is not very
obvious, to say nothing of their connection with the predictions of Judas'
treachery.

</p>
<p>An editor of our Gospel, perhaps the last, has given a
Johannine turn to the direct announcement of the betrayal (xiii, 21-30),

</p>
<p align="center">220

</p>
<p>in which the Christ is made to reveal the traitor's
identity to the beloved disciple; a somewhat childish piece of imagination,
notwithstanding the symbolism in the &quot;sop&quot; (mouthful) given by Jesus
to Judas (26-27). This is the first occasion on which the beloved disciple is
brought into prominence, and it is in his honour that our editor exploits the
denunciation of the traitor in the Synoptics (cf. Mark xiv, 19; Matthew xxvi,
22; Luke xxii 23). In the perspective of the story the disciple in question can
only be one of the Twelve, but his anonymity has the immediate effect of
suggesting that he is a symbolic figure, type of the true disciple, even though
his introducer intended him to be identified with an historical person to whom
the composition of the Gospel might thereafter be attributed. The place assigned
him at the Christ's side makes not only a relation of personal friendship with
Jesus, but complete partnership of the well-beloved in the spiritual riches
which are to overflow mankind from the breast of Jesus (cf. vii, 38; supra, p.
209). It is to this disciple that Peter turns to find out who is to be the
traitor, and it should be noted that an analogous relation, in which the beloved
disciple takes the lead, exists between the two every time they appear on the
scene in company (xviii, 16; xx, 4-8; and again xxi, 7, 20-22) — a plain
indication of the superiority claimed by the Johannine to the common apostolic
tradition. The incident of the sop given to Judas must be secondary in relation
to the preamble. In the preamble (xiii, 2), the devil has already entered into
Judas before the meal began; here he is delivered to Satan after eating the sop,
which he eats to his damnation (cf. i Corinthians xi, 29; Luke xxii, 3).

</p>
<p>The exhortation to mutual love, conceived in the spirit and
style of the first Johannine Epistle (cf. i John ii, 7-10; iii, 23) is a
surcharge on the announcement of Peter's denial, which has already been borrowed
from the synoptic tradition as it stands in Mark, Matthew and Luke. One feature
not derived from that source is the veiled allusion to the later martyrdom of
Peter, in the symbolic words &quot;thou shalt follow me afterwards.&quot; This
mysterious prediction, we must add, is far from being an indication that the
passage which contains it is either primitive or of high antiquity.

</p>
<p>The mystic allocution flows on from xiii into xiv,
unmindful

</p>
<p align="center">221

</p>
<p>of the inserted conversation between Peter and Jesus.
Similarly intercalated into its continuation are the following:

</p>
<p>The naive question by Thomas about the locality to which
Jesus says he is about to go (4-5); the no less naive demand of Philip,
&quot;show us the Father,&quot; and the words in which Jesus expresses his
astonishment (8-ioa); the promise of another Helper, the Spirit of Truth (15-17,
25-26); and the question of Jude (22).

</p>
<p>The Spirit appears in our Gospel mainly as the continuator
of the revelation inaugurated by the Christ, and its action is partly merged
into that of the Christian sacrament. Thus, in a sense, the Spirit is a
substitute for Jesus. We may recall at this point that in the Acts of the
Apostles the reign of the Spirit is brought in by the miracle of Pentecost which
takes place ten days after the Ascension. In the mind of the Gospel editor there
can have been no thought of a human substitute, Marcion, Montanus or any other,
since it is expressly stated that the Helper will &quot;be with you for
ever&quot; (xiv, 16). In any case the discourses, in their original form, rule
out the possibility of a substitute for the immortal Christ, who abides
continuously in those who love him (cf. i John ii, 1 where the Christ is himself
the Paraclete, the Helper). Finally, it is evident that the reflections (27-31)
which follow the reiterated promise of the Paraclete, and end with the words
&quot;Arise let us go hence,&quot; were imagined by the compiler of the
preceding instruction with a view to proceeding immediately with the story of
the Passion. But another compilation, three chapters in extent (xv-xvii), has
been inserted between this point and the opening of the Passion story (xviii, 1).

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Last Instructions of the Christ</b>

</p>
<p>No introduction is arranged for this new collection, the
reader apparently being invited to take it as the continuation of the preceding
discourse. The subjects treated in it are, moreover, the same as those in its
predecessor, as follows:

</p>
<p>Allegory of the vine (xv, 1-10) urging the disciples to
remain united in the Christ, the source of eternal life, and direct exhortation
to abide in the love of Jesus (11-17). Condemnation of a world gone astray which
will hate the disciples as it has hated their Master (18-25 and perhaps xvi,
1-4). New promises con-

</p>
<p align="center">222

</p>
<p>cerning the Spirit which will support the disciples in
persecution and condemn the world (26-27; xvi, 5-16). New announcement of
persecutions to come, but the sorrow of the persecuted will be changed into joy,
and the Christ himself will visit his own (xvi, 16-24). All this Jesus has
spoken in plain terms, because he is about to depart; let the faithful, in the
hour of persecution, be at peace in him (25-33). Finally the Christ, to crown
his exhortations, offers to his Father a long prayer that all believers, present
and to come, may be preserved in mystic union with himself (xvii).

</p>
<p>Like those that precede them these last instructions of the
Christ are presented as though he were giving them to his disciples while still
among them but with death immediately before him; in reality they are addressed,
by the immortal Christ, to his Church. But though in a manner complementary to
what has gone before, they are not all to be regarded, either separately or
together, as pieces of secondary composition.

</p>
<p>The allegory of the vine, with the exhortation attached to
it (xv, 1-17), may be considered as a primitive document self-contained and
independent of the compilation in which it now finds a place. The allegory has
an orderly development in the style of the prophets (cf. Isaiah v, 1-7; Jeremiah
ii, 21; Ezechiel xv, 1-6; Psalm lxxx, 8-16). The suggestion of it comes from
passages in the Synoptics where mention is made of the vine and its fruit,
chiefly from what is said about wine in their account of the eucharistic
institution (Mark xiv, 25; Matthew xxvi, 29; Luke xxii, 18). The first words,
then, are enough to show that this new course of instruction has the same close
connection with the eucharist as the two preceding chapters, always linked to
the eucharist, as they are, by the conception of that highest form of love which
is willing to die for the sake of the beloved. Considered from another point of
view, the allegory of the vine which, in some parts, makes a fellow to that of
the Good Shepherd (x, 1-18), is the less well-balanced of the two, the author
pressing hard on disparate images, that of the gardener who tends the vine and
that of the necessity for the branch to remain united to the main stem. As
supporting the application made of them to the Christ and to the disciples, the
two images are ill-matched.

</p>
<p>&quot;While love is the relation between the Christ and his
own, 

</p>
<p align="center">223

</p>
<p>the world, on its side, is characterized by the hate it
bears to both of them. The theme has already been indicated in vii, 7; cf. i
John iii, 13-16 where the hatred-theme is also treated in connection with the
love-theme. But here the brief discourse on the world as the enemy (18-25) comes
in awkwardly. Its secondary character appears in its making a back reference
(20) to a statement, lacking in originality, already made in the text (xiii,
16).

</p>
<p>In like manner, the new dissertation on the
&quot;Helper&quot; (the Paraclete) is of feebler inspiration (xv, 26-xvi, 15).
What is said there about the judgment to be passed on the world (xvi, 8-n) is a
confused rigmarole which recalls the least impressive passages in the first
Johannine Epistle. One interesting statement, however, stands out from the rest:
&quot;the Paraclete shall declare unto you the things that are to come.&quot; To
what else can this refer than to the Johannine Apocalypse? If that be admitted,
the inference will follow that all the passages about the Helper were added by
the compilers of the Johannine collection of books, and that these additions
were made at the time when they were engaged in the attempt to obtain
acceptance, under the same apostolic name, of the Apocalypse, the fourth Gospel
and the three Epistles. Another important point to be noted is the saying in
xvi, 4: &quot;these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was
with you.&quot; These words sound strangely as coming from the Christ. Without
intending to do so the author has given away the secret that the speaker has
long quitted this world and that, while seemingly addressing his first
disciples, he is really speaking to the Church of the second century.

</p>
<p>The final Consolation (xvi, 20-24, 26-28, 32-33), given in
view of the coming persecutions, was possibly at first an independent
composition. A preamble has here been constructed for it (16-19) which might be
understood as referring to the Christ's resurrection, his apparition and even
his second coming; but the Consolation to which it leads on has a different
theme; it is a hymn of the mystic union, spiritual and perpetual, with the
ever-living Christ, a hymn of his return in that sense. An interruption by the
disciples has been introduced into the Consolation itself (29-31, to which 25 is
co-ordinate). Intercalated in also the remark on the parabolic, i.e. allegorical
and symbolic, character of the teaching in all these discourses. But the
disciples' interruption

</p>
<p align="center">224

</p>
<p>has been inserted by an editor who wished to emphasize
their lack of intelligence and to give a character of formal prophecy to the
allusion made in the discourse to their abandonment of Jesus in the Passion
(32).

</p>
<p>Let it be noted that, on this point, the Synoptics in their
canonical form, do not say so much, and that the Johannine account of the
Passion gives it flat contradiction. With this the Gospel of Peter, which
probably depends on John, is in agreement, and the version very possibly retains
a primitive datum. Contrasting with the disciples' abandonment of their Master
comes the saying: &quot;but I am not left alone, because my Father is with
me&quot; which we have already encountered (viii, 16, 29). It has the same
bearing here as before {supra, p. 210).

</p>
<p>&quot;In the world ye shall have suffering; but be of good
cheer; I have vanquished the world.&quot; So the Consolation ends, in language
which expresses confidence in victory to come; but the voice which speaks is,
before all else, that of the Christ in glory, the Christ of the Eucharist,
imparting courage to Christians everywhere. In the very act of dying, the
Christ, now in glory, overthrew the world and the prince who ruled it (cf. xii,
31). Those who love him and whom he loves, his own, will conquer the world in
their turn, nor will they fall into the hand of its prince when they, too, come
to die.

</p>
<p>The final prayer of the Christ (xvii) is not only the
crowning utterance to the lessons taught, but the eucharistic keynote of the
Last Supper, conceived as the first Love Feast (Agape). We may regard it as the
first act of solemn thanksgiving, the first eucharist, a supreme utterance of
Christian charity appropriate to the occasion. Jesus begins by asking that he
may be glorified, because his work is done (1-8). Then he commends his loved
ones, whom he is leaving in the world, to the care of the Father (9-19). Finally
he prays that God, the Christ and the loved ones may all be one in love (20-26).
His prayer is a lyric, constructed rhythmically and with balance of the parts.
[1] Although apparently uttered in particular circumstances, it may, originally,
have had no place in a Gospel story. We may take it as a type of eucharistic
prayer, placed in the mouth of Jesus as master of the mystery; 

</p>
<p>[1] For the prayer with which the hymn concludes, as
restored by M. Loisy, see Appendix to this chapter. Translator's note.

</p>
<p align="center">225

</p>
<p>perhaps the oracle of some Christian prophet first recited
to the community at the Easter celebration, not as the common thanksgiving but
as the prophet's own. The same may be true of other passages in our Gospel,
especially of the discourses after the Supper, of which the analysis is now
concluded.

</p>
<p>Two small additions may be detected in the final prayer:
the profession of faith in verse 3, impersonal both in form and tone, out of
keeping with the context and with nothing in it specifically Johannine; and
verse 12 &quot;except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled&quot; evidently added to correspond with xiii, 18, 21-30, but equally
out of place with the foregoing. 

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">THE JOHANNINE ACCOUNT OF THE PASSION</font>

</p>
<p>The arrangement of the Passion and the Resurrection stories
in our Gospel has, to all appearance, an almost systematic ordering; the Christ
is now returning to his Father; he goes by the way of death; he arrives by
resurrection. The scenes of his arrest; of his appearance before the
high-priest, with Peter's denial of him; of Pilate passing judgment; of the
crucifixion; of the burial; of the resurrection — all these follow in an order
and develop in a manner that furnishes a worthy conclusion to the revelation of
glory, which has pursued its course from the beginning of the book. But the
story is far from being all of one piece.

</p>
<p>It may be said that the Johannine Christ himself controls
the conditions of his arrest. He dispatches Judas on his errand, commanding him
to do quickly what he has to do (xiii, 27). When the hour strikes, he repairs
with his disciples to the place where the traitor will come to take him, a
garden beyond Kedron (xviii, 1; note that the name Gethsemane is omitted).
Judas, on his side, calls up the Roman cohort and the tribune in garrison at the
tower of Antonia, and with them the service-men of the Sanhedrim; this last to
enhance the importance of the scene about to be enacted; for we may be very sure
that if the armed forces of the procurator took any part in the affair there
would have been no need either of the temple police or of Judas himself; nor
would Jesus have been taken before the high-priest. When the force arrives at
the garden, Jesus advances to meet it, demands its business, and receiving the
answer that they are looking for Jesus

</p>
<p align="center">226

</p>
<p>the Nazorean, speaks a word that throws them all back-ward
to the ground. Then he gives himself up, ordering his captors to let his
companions go.

</p>
<p>Introduced into a scene of such dignity, the sword-stroke
that cut off the ear of the high-priest's servant is clearly out of place and
keeping. But the compiler who mentions the incident knows that the servant was
called Malchus; that his right ear was the one cut off; that the disciple who
struck the blow was no other than Peter, and that Jesus rebuked him:
&quot;return thy sword to the sheath. The cup my Father has given me, shall I
not drink it?&quot; (10-11). This, surely, is the cup of Gethsemane which Jesus
in the Synoptics prays the Father to remove from him. Peter's sword-stroke takes
the place of the protest he raises in Mark (viii, 32) and Matthew (xvi, 22) at
the first announcement of the Passion; and the rebuke he now receives is the
Johannine equivalent of the terrible apostrophe: &quot;get thee gone,
Satan.&quot; From instances such as this, of which there are many in our Gospel,
we may learn how to interpret its dependence on the Synoptics, and judge at the
same time in what kind of relation to theirs is the treatment of Peter's
prestige by the editors of John. Here, as in Mark, Peter is the man to whom the
mystery of salvation is at first wholly unintelligible, and who, in his ill
informed zeal, would prevent its realization. Of the remaining traits in the
story of the arrest, the omission of Judas' kiss is not less significant than
these additions.

</p>
<p>The story continues (xviii, 12): &quot;Then the cohort, the
tribune and the Jews' servants laid hold of Jesus and led him to Annas.&quot;
This follows on naturally after the order given by the Christ to leave his
disciples at liberty, [1] and marks as a secondary addition the intervening
incident of Peter's outbreak and the severed ear. But the account of Jesus
before the high-priest is loaded with postscripts to a degree which has baffled
interpreters from the first; even the textual history of the passage shows that
it has been revised again and again, in the vain attempt to find a satisfactory
reading, and the same is true of like attempts made by modem critics. The
confusion arises from the fact that the primitive account knew of only one
high-priest, Annas (Hanan); it knew nothing of Caiaphas as concerned in the
matter, and, equally, 

</p>
<p>[1] xviii, 9 is a lame reference to xvii, 12.

</p>
<p align="center">227

</p>
<p>nothing of Peter's denial. Caiaphas has been joined to
Annas to make some sort of agreement with Matthew xxvi, 57, when it is to
Caiaphas and not, as here, to Annas that his captors take Jesus; this is done by
making him son-in-law to Annas, on the ground that several sons of Annas had
become high-priests and that Caiaphas was presumably one of the family. His
antecedents are also recalled (xviii, 1313 — 14; cf. xi, 49-50; supra, p.
214).

</p>
<p>Peter's denial, imported from the Synoptics, we find
divided into two parts (xviii, 15-18; 25-27) for the editorial convenience of
finding a role for a certain unnamed disciple who is said to have been an
acquaintance of the high-priest's, and can be no other than the well-beloved.
This disciple introduces Peter to the high-priest's court, where he has the
unpleasant surprise of encountering a kinsman of the Malchus whose ear he had
cut off. All these precisions reveal the compiler of our Gospel as a man of
lively invention. It is abundantly clear that in the original account not one of
his disciples followed Jesus after his arrest (xviii, 8; xvi, 32).

</p>
<p>The author of the foundation-story who knew Christianity as
the religion of a sect, reduces the whole trial before the high-priest to an
enquiry about Jesus' disciples and teaching (19). Jesus answers that he has
always spoken openly to the world, either in the synagogues (Galilee) [1] or in
the temple (Jerusalem); let the question of his teaching be asked of those who
heard it. (In reality the author is replying to the Jews and pagans of his own
age, who alleged that Jesus had preached only in a lost corner of Palestine and
converted a few ignorant Galileans.) At this answer one of the court officials,
judging it an impertinence, strikes Jesus with his hand: this is all that the
author chooses to retain of the ignominious scene described in the Synoptics
(Mark xiv, 65; Matthew xxvi, 67-68; Luke xxii, 63-65). Jesus answers with great
dignity (23), so great indeed that the answer would be too solemn for so mean an
insult were it not that the insulter stands for the unbelieving Jews, murderers
of the Christ and persecutors of his followers. Thereupon the inquiry closes,
and Jesus is taken away from the quarters of the high-priest (Annas in the
original story, Caiaphas in the altered text) to Pilate's praetorium.

</p>
<p>[1] It is, however, the fact that only one case of this is
reported in our Gospel (vi, 59).

</p>
<p align="center">228

</p>
<p>The author is careful to note that this happened on the
morning of the day in the evening of which the paschal lamb -was sacrificed.
This timing is more important to him than the imagined consequence in the
development of the scene. For it results from the date indicated that Jesus died
on the day and at the hour of the paschal sacrifice; in this way our Gospel
represents the Christ's passion as confirming the Easter usage of the
quartodecimans.

</p>
<p>This, for him, was the essential matter; but it leads him
on to imagine that the Jews must have abstained from entering the praetorium
from fear of contracting legal impurity (28); nevertheless he makes Jesus go in.
The tribunal is in front of the palace, a kind of open space where a crowd of
Jews awaits the result of the proceedings inside, an unnatural arrangement
constructed with the object of introducing a private conversation between Pilate
and his prisoner, when Jesus will utter some lofty sayings which the writer will
not allow him to utter in the presence of Jews. In consequence of this
arrangement, the judgment scene falls into two parts, as Pilate goes away from
the Jews, who are outside the building, to Jesus, who is inside, and then comes
back from Jesus to the Jews.

</p>
<p>The trial now proceeds as follows. First, the procurator
receives the accusation which &quot;the Jews&quot; (the Jewish magistrates)
refuse to withdraw and deal with themselves, on the ground (29-31) that they
have no right to pronounce sentence of death (which was true at the time the
evangelist was writing, but not in the time of Jesus). This happened, remarks
the author (32), in order that Jesus might be crucified, as he had predicted,
[1] crucifixion being a punishment which Roman authority alone could inflict.
Pilate then goes inside to interrogate the accused who, on receiving the blunt
question &quot;art thou the King of the Jews?&quot; makes the mystic answer that
his &quot;kingdom is not of this world&quot; and is not defended by armed force;
he is King &quot;that he may bear witness to the truth.&quot; These sublime
declarations are beyond Pilate's comprehension, but he concludes that there can
be no harm in a king of truth, and accordingly goes back to the Jews to inform
them that he finds no crime in the prisoner (38). At this the Jews break out
into protest, declaring that the accused falls under the stroke of the Law for

</p>
<p>[1] iii, 14; viii, 28; xii, 32-33.

</p>
<p align="center">229

</p>
<p>saying he is the Son of God (this is the charge of
blasphemy, which in the synoptic account, [1] is ground of condemnation by the
Sanhedrim; but here &quot;Son of God&quot; is taken in the Johannine sense).
Troubled by this, Pilate now goes back to Jesus and asks him whence he comes. No
answer. Pilate insists and impresses on the prisoner that he has power to
release him or to put him to death on the cross; Jesus replies that he would
have no such power had not Providence conferred it upon him; so much the heavier
is the guilt of Satan who has prompted Judas and the Jews to deliver him to
Roman justice (xix, 7-11). Reassured on that side, Pilate makes a new effort to
get the accusation withdrawn, only to meet with fresh protest from the Jews, who
cry out that a pretender to kingship is Caesar's enemy, thus returning to the
political charge with which they had begun. This brings Pilate to the end of his
resistance. Yielding to the necessity of the situation (needless to scrutinize
his psychology) he has Jesus brought out and makes him sit down on the judgment
seat. The right translation here is &quot;made him sit down,&quot; as the Gospel
of Peter and Justin {Apology, 35) both understand it. If we suppose that Pilate
himself sat down, the common translation, the whole scene loses the significance
intended by the evangelist, who imagines it as the presentation of a king to his
subjects only to be rejected instead of acclaimed. This is the meaning of
Pilate's announcement to the Jews &quot;behold your King!&quot;, of the clamour
that immediately breaks out for the crucifixion of the man offered them, and of
the declaration that they will have no king but Caesar. Faced with this blind
obstinacy Pilate, we are to suppose, is now powerless to refuse sentence of
death, and has no alternative but to hand Jesus over to them for crucifixion
(13-16). It is the doing of the Jews, then, that the King of Truth is condemned
to death as the King of Israel.

</p>
<p>The picture before us, remote as it is from all reality,
even from verisimilitude, is nevertheless grand in conception and in the
profound irony with which, from the height of a sublime mysticism, the Jews are
exhibited. To conform with the Synoptics there have been wedged into it the
incident of Barabbas (xviii, 39-40) and the mockery in the praetorium (xix,
1-3), the latter symbolically dramatized and corrected as the presentation of 

</p>
<p>[1] Mark xiv, 61 — 64; Matthew xxvi, 63-66; Luke xxii,
66-70.

</p>
<p align="center">230

</p>
<p>&quot;the man&quot; (4-6). But this added presentation
repeats in advance the presentation of &quot;the King&quot; (14) and greatly
diminishes its effect. Note how, at the end of xix, 6, we are back at the point
where we left off at the end of xviii, 38. Note also that in xviii, 40 the Jews
are made to &quot;cry out again&quot; though our Gospel has not mentioned any
previous cry. This is a slip of the interpolator: by inadvertence he here
follows Mark xv, 13, whereas for the whole of the Barabbas incident he has been
following Luke xxiii, 16-19.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Crucifixion</b>

</p>
<p>Having obtained the sentence they demanded the Jews lead
the condemned to the place of punishment, Jesus himself carrying his cross
(i6(5-i7; in contradiction to Luke xxiii, 26). The sequel, however, shows
clearly (23) that the execution is carried out by Roman soldiers, Pilate himself
controlling the details (19-22). The contradiction of the Synoptics on the point
of Simon of Cyrene carrying the cross is deliberate, the set purpose of the
evangelist being to bring out the Christ's free and sovereign control in the
preliminaries of his death and in death itself. Perhaps also there was an
intention to combat certain gnostics who, like Basilides, maintained that Simon
was crucified in the Christ's place. They bring Jesus &quot;to a place called
the Skull, Golgotha in the Hebrew&quot; — the synoptic designation —
&quot;where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side, and
Jesus in the midst&quot; (18). The author refrains from saying that these two
companions were thieves; this by way of suppressing the suggestion of infamy.

</p>
<p>The inscription on the cross gives occasion to a symbolic
incident (19-22): despite the opposition of the chief priests, Pilate maintains
the wording of it, &quot;Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.&quot; Thus
Jesus keeps his Kingship and Christhood, let Jewish incredulity protest as it
will. The three languages betoken the universal sovereignty of the Son of God.

</p>
<p>In the incidents that follow, up to the original conclusion
of the book (xx, 30-31), it is not easy to distinguish what belongs to the
fundamental document from the secondary additions. What we are told about the
division of the garments may be secondary: it is the forced interpretation of a
prophetic text (Psalm xxii, 18) the fulfilment of which had to be marked, the 

</p>
<p align="center">231

</p>
<p>&quot;garments&quot; and the &quot;vesture&quot; meaning
the same object. Doubtless more was intended than to mark the fulfilment of a
prophecy, the robe without seam suggesting an allegory in which some of the
Fathers recognized the Church. Such a symbolism, however, is not in the same
current as that of the &quot;signs&quot; encountered at an earlier stage, such
as those of the man born blind and the raising of Lazarus.

</p>
<p>The latter symbolism returns in the incident that follows,
the words spoken by the Christ to his mother and the beloved disciple (25-27).
As this incident concerns only the mother and the disciple, it may be assumed
that the other women whose names are given (25) have been added to achieve some
sort of agreement with the Synoptics. Here again, as in the story of Cana (ii,
4), Jesus addresses his mother as &quot;Woman&quot;; but this time lie does not
repudiate her. The meaning of the incident seems to be that converted Jews must
accept hellenic Christianity as the legitimate offspring of the old Covenant,
while the same Christianity, on its side, must regard as its mother the
Jewish-Christian Church with its Old Testament tradition.

</p>
<p>The last incident preceding the death of the Christ is the
offer of vinegar; it marks a simple fulfilment of the prophecy in Psalm Ixix,
21. But a touch of symbolism is not wanting, for the vinegar is offered with a
bunch of hyssop, in allusion to the paschal ritual (Exodus xii, 22) which
prescribed the use of hyssop to splash the house-doors with the blood of the
lamb. The symbolism is somewhat far-fetched. Its presentation as a fulfilment of
Scripture has the look of being a surcharge. The beginning of the verse (2817)
is in contradiction with the end of it, which brings in another Scripture still
to be fulfilled. We should read as follows:

</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus, knowing that all was accomplished&quot; —
his role completely finished according to providential designs, whether
expressed in Scripture or not — &quot;in order that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, said, I thirst.&quot; The natural sequel to &quot;knowing that all
was now accomplished&quot; comes after the presentation and reception of the
vinegar (30): &quot;he said, it is finished. And bending down his head, he
poured out the spirit.&quot;

</p>
<p>This peaceful and willing death is the Johannine substitute
for the scene in the first two Gospels, in which a great cry escapes from Jesus
at the moment when he expires (Mark xv, 37; Matthew

</p>
<p align="center">232

</p>
<p>xxvii, 50). It figures the gift of the spirit which Jesus,
with bent head, breathes forth in his last breath on the beloved group gathered
round the foot of the cross; they symbolize his Church. The death of the
Johannine Christ provides no scene of agony, ignominy and darkness, for it is
nothing else than the resurrection of Jesus to his glorious and blessed
eternity; his death and his resurrection are coincident. We must bear that in
mind if we are to understand the meaning attached to Easter by the quartodeciman
Christians of Asia.

</p>
<p>Their Easter, coinciding with the Jewish Passover, might
fall on any one of the seven days of the week, but it is a fact to be noted that
up to this point our Gospel had not told us on which day the Christ's death took
place. We are now going to be told, and to see how the Johannine Easter was made
to fit in, by one means or another, to the synoptic framework in which Easter is
celebrated on Sunday. The very first incident to follow the death of Jesus in
the Johannine account informs us that Jesus died on the evening of a Friday and
that he had to be buried before the Sabbath of next day. In its basic form the
passage (xix, 31-37) informing us of the finishing blow administered to the
victims and the prompt removal of the three bodies for common burial (31) is
quite independent of the Synoptics and may well represent an important
tradition, inasmuch as this tradition would contradict not only the stories of
the Christ's burial in the Synoptics but those which, under synoptic influence,
are now to follow in the Gospel before us. But, in the traditional form in which
it comes down to us, there are features in the paragraph which class it among
the latest additions to be found in our Gospel; these are, first, the symbolism
of the water and the blood betokening the Christian sacraments, and, second, the
calling up of a text from Exodus (xii, 46), &quot;not a bone of his body shall
be broken,&quot; which symbolically identifies the Christ with the paschal lamb,
and another from Zechariah (xii, 10), surcharged upon the former, and made to
predict the lance-thrust of the Roman soldier. The passage referring to the
incident in the first Johannine Epistle (i John v, 6-7) is also an interpolation
in that Epistle, but stands there as the authorized interpretation of the Gospel
passage now before us, the two possibly coming from the same writer. According
to this interpretation we are to understand

</p>
<p align="center">233

</p>
<p>the Spirit which John the Baptist saw descending on Jesus
and which Jesus, with his last breath, poured out upon his own, as connected
with water and blood, the water of baptism and the blood of Calvary figured in
the Eucharist, the two together bearing one inseparable witness to the immortal
Christ.

</p>
<p>There is something more in the passage as it has come down
to us. The Gospel compilers attest the prodigy on the testimony of the beloved
disciple who was present when Jesus died. But who are the compilers who allege
this testimony? They are the same persons as those who would have it believed
that the Apocalypse, the Gospel and the three Epistles are all the work of one
author, and that author the apostle John (cf. xxi, 24). We may conclude that the
scene in our Gospel, the witness of the beloved disciple and the attribution of
the book to the apostle John are integral parts in a single fiction of late
invention.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Burial, Resurrection and Apparitions</b>

</p>
<p>The story of the burial by Joseph of Arimathea is borrowed
from the synoptic tradition. To him has been added Nicodemus who brings with him
a great weight of spices to furnish the Christ with a princely embalmment. (The
compiler forgets that the utmost haste was necessary to get the body buried
before the Sabbath began, and that an embalmment on this scale would be a very
lengthy operation.) Needless to say the &quot;garden&quot; in which the
sepulchre is situated has a mystic meaning: it is the new garden of God where
the Church, the new Eve, will be drawn from the side of the new Adam; the new
sepulchre and the spices belong to the same current. But it may well be doubted
whether the author of the Gospel in its original form, who understood everything
in a spiritual sense, and the resurrection most emphatically so, was concerned
to this extent with the dead body of Jesus, or that he is responsible for the
stories in our present fourth Gospel which turn the resurrection into a miracle
of the physical order, attested by material proofs.

</p>
<p>To find a clear path through the events described in
chapter xx is no easy task. The descriptions show signs of successive
retouchings, and elements belonging to the fundamental document are but dimly
discernible. Three apparitions of the Christ follow without a break; the first
to Mary of Magdala (1-18) on

</p>
<p align="center">234

</p>
<p>the morning of the resurrection; the second to the
assembled disciples on the evening of the same day (19-23); the third again to
the disciples, now including the sceptical Thomas, on the Sunday following
(24-29).

</p>
<p>The first apparition is surcharged with the news carried by
Mary to Peter and the beloved disciple (1-2, after the words &quot;she saw the
stone had been turned aside from the sepulchre&quot;); by the visit of the two
disciples to the tomb, where it becomes clear that this addition, as well as the
foregoing, has been imagined to the greater glory of the beloved disciple, who
must be the first to believe in the resurrection of Jesus, contrary to what the
primitive tradition tells of Peter; finally, by the appearance of angels to Mary
(11-14, after &quot;as she wept, she stooped&quot;) — this to make agreement
with the synoptic introduction of angels, but a meaningless repetition of the
apparition of Jesus himself. In tills, the message to the disciples entrusted to
Mary has a solemn dignity: she is charged to inform the &quot;brethren&quot;
that Jesus has reascended to God. But the attempt to determine exactly the
original meaning of this first apparition is a vain one. The story of it must
have been modified profoundly, doubtless because it differed too obviously from
the other Gospels. [1]

</p>
<p>Brief as it is, the account of the second apparition has
been overlaid at several points. In the general arrangement it resembles the
account in the third Gospel (Luke xxiv, 36-40, 45-49). We are inclined to think
that, to the original creator of the scene, this was the one and only sensible
apparition of Jesus after his resurrection, expressed in the simple statement
that, the disciples being assembled and the doors closed, Jesus appeared in
their midst and said: &quot;Peace be unto you.'&quot; Immediately after there is
a surcharge, intended to prepare the way for the coming apparition to Thomas, of
which that story, when it comes later, has no knowledge — &quot;and saying
this, he showed them his hands and his side&quot; (xx, 200), the reference to
the soldier's lance-thrust probably due to the compiler who has inserted that
episode in the story of the Passion. As though there were nothing surprising in
the apparition, the only sentiment attributed to the disciples is that of joy
(20). After which Jesus repeats his salutation and 

</p>
<p>[1] On the ancient writers who substitute the mother of
Jesus for the Magdalene, see Le quatrième Evangile, 504.

</p>
<p align="center">235

</p>
<p>gives them their mission (21; cf. xvii, 18 and Matthew
xxviii, 19-20). Although the repeated salutation (21) may be a surcharge, added
to prevent the discourse of Jesus being only the announcement of a mission, it
is probable that the words which follow, about the power to remit sins, also
come from the original author, omitting those which refer to the insufflation of
the Spirit.

</p>
<p>The third apparition (24-29), made for convincing Thomas,
is an appendix to the second, and due to some reviser who was concerned to
demonstrate the reality of the Christ's bodily resurrection; the remarks of
Thomas, &quot;if I see not the mark of the nails,&quot; etc., makes that clear
enough. Nevertheless the moral of the story is to the effect that normal faith
has no need of such proofs. It is possible that the anecdote was added to combat
Docetism, but what it directly contradicts is the doctrine of the original
evangelist, which taught the spiritual immortality of the Christ, but not the
material resurrection of his dead body. It remains to note that this third
apparition is conceived by the author as definitely the last to occur. After the
words &quot;blessed are they who, not having seen, believe&quot; any further
apparition stories would be worse than superfluous.

</p>
<p>The concluding lines (30-31), concerning the object of the
book, come from the writer whom we may call the first editor of the Gospel. They
give no sign that he wished to be regarded as an apostolic person. Moreover he
bids farewell to his readers with the unmistakable air of having finished his
work and completed the mystic instruction of the Christian. After this the
chapter that follows is clearly marked as an accretion, of which the effect is
to derange the primitive economy of the whole book.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Supplementary Apparition</b>

</p>
<p>This supplementary chapter has the threefold object of
relating an apparition of the risen Christ to Peter and six of the disciples by
the Lake of Tiberias (xxi, 1-14); the rehabilitation, by a triple profession of
love, of Simon-Peter to whom the Christ confides the care of his sheep (15-17);
predictions of Jesus about the martyrdom of Peter and the future of the beloved
disciple (20-23), an editorial invention, relatively late, and connected with
the attribution of the Gospel to this disciple, in the epilogue (24-25).

</p>
<p align="center">236

</p>
<p>To the same editor belong, without counting retouches and
the arrangement of the material he is working on, the formula of introduction
(i); the role of the beloved disciple in the miraculous draught, where the
disciple is before Peter in recognizing Jesus (7); the statement about the
number of fish and the resistance of the net, symbolic touches in the editor's
usual vein; finally the number in the series assigned to the apparition (14).
The whole is composed of borrowings from the synoptic tradition of apparitions
in Galilee, and from the third Gospel. The general intention of it all is,
beyond doubt, to make the Johannine Gospel acceptable in the churches at large,
the prominence given to Peter being certain to win the approval in particular of
the church in Rome. But the conglomerate of material here collected from various
sources is as far as possible from holding together. It breaks up on analysis
into the following borrowed elements: the miraculous draught of fishes, which
is a myth of the institution of Christian propaganda, anticipated in Luke v, 1-11 (the introduction just here of this, the primordial, meaning of the miracle,
is somewhat strange); the incident of Peter plunging from the boat into the sea
in order to be with Jesus again, which recalls a similar incident in Matthew
(xiv, 25-33, the antedating of a resurrection story); the meal of bread and
fish, recalling the miraculous multiplication of the loaves (vi, 5-13), the meal
with the pilgrims of Emmaus, and especially the peculiar feature of the broiled
fish in the apparition to all the disciples recorded by the same Gospel (Luke
xxiv, 41-43).

</p>
<p>The solemn colloquy of the Christ with Peter (15-17), in
which the primacy of the apostle is consecrated, has been consciously moulded
into an equivalent of what we read in Matthew xvi, 17-19, which it imitates even
to the form, and in Luke xxii, 32, though it was at first conceived
independently of this Gospel. It is a safe conjecture that the prediction of
Peter's martyrdom (18-19, echoing xiii, 36) was worded with an eye on the
Apocalypse of Peter (supra, p. 53). All this, for better or worse, and for worse
rather than better, is crowded into the same perspective. The last sayings about
the beloved disciple (20-23) are of the feeblest invention, but are intended to
prepare the way for the conclusion of the chapter (24-25), which is also to be
the conclusion of the book. The object aimed at is to present the Elder,

</p>
<p>237

</p>
<p>John the Old, a well-known figure long resident in Asia, as
author of the Gospel and to convey a hint — no more than a hint is given —
that he is the same person as the apostle John, son of Zebedee. Who are the
&quot;we&quot; who guarantee his testimony (24)? They are &quot;the Elders&quot;
who had known this John and brought out under his name the collection of
Johannine books. We thus see that this supplement to the Gospel, intended to
make it acceptable to all the Churches, was also intended to give it apostolic
authority and value.

</p>
<p>Such, then, is the sublime but inconsistent book whose
destiny it was to dominate Christian theology and to fix its form. How did it
originate?

</p>
<p>Towards the end of the first century or the beginning of
the second there lived a mystic prophet, a master of gnosis rather than an
apostle of the faith, from whom came forth the hymns and symbolic visions on
which the fourth Gospel is founded. A little later, towards 135-140, his sublime
meditations were collected and framed in a Gospel story, to be used as a manual
of initiation into the Christian faith, like other books of similar form already
in circulation among the churches. The chronological framework was probably
fixed at the same time and a part of the borrowings made from the synoptic
tradition. At this stage and in this form the book had no author's name attached
to it and its diffusion was limited, or nearly so, to the province of Asia. Some
fifteen or twenty years later, towards 150-160, the Marcionite heresy having
broken out, this Asiatic book was amended, completed and more or less worked
over, not only by the addition of chapter xxi, but by other retouches and
additions in the main body; it was then boldly presented as the work of an
apostle. But everything was welcome that gave satisfaction to faith, and the
result just described was accepted by those whose will-to-believe found the
truth in it. Thus it came to pass that, when the Montanist controversy broke
out, the adversaries of these pretended writings of the apostle John found
nobody to listen to them. When later, towards 190, the great controversy arose
about the keeping of Easter, the Roman Church failed to perceive, or pretended
not to perceive that, while the Synoptics supported the ritual tradition of Rome
and of most other Chris-

</p>
<p align="center">238

</p>
<p>tian churches, the fourth Gospel supported the different
tradition followed by the churches of Asia.

  that they also may be sanctified in truth ...<br>
  And the glory thou gavest to me, yea to me,<br>
  I gave to them,<br>
  That they may be one<br>
  as we are one,<br>
  I in them<br>
  and thou in me<br>
  that they may be perfect in unity,<br>
  That the world may know<br>
  that thou hast sent me<br>
  And that thou hast loved them<br>
  as thou hast loved me.<br>
  Father, those whom thou hast given me,<br>
  I would that where I am<br>
  They too may be with me,<br>
  That they may see my glory,<br>
  which thou hast given me,<br>
  For thou hast loved me<br>
  before the foundation of the world.<br>
  Righteous Father, the world has known thee not,<br>
  but I, I knew thee;<br>
  And they too have known<br>
  that thou hast sent me.<br>
  And to them have I made known thy name,<br>
  and will make it known,<br>
  That the love wherewith thou lovest me may be<br>
  in them and I in them.
