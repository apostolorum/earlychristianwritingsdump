<title>The Origins of the New Testament: Chapter 4</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2><i>Chapter IV</i></h2></center>
<center><h2>ANALYSIS OF THE GOSPEL CATECHESIS&nbsp;</h2><h2>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING
TO MARK</h2></center>
<p>THE catechesis we have called evangelical, though officially certified by
names deemed to be apostolic, does not go back to the earliest age of
Christianity and is far from such antiquity. First and foremost it is a
catechesis. True it is that the majority of modern critics, in our time,
obstinately regard it as a collection of memories, more or less authentic, of
the life of Jesus. It is however, nothing else than a manual of Christian
initiation, as the eschatological catechesis was before it, but with this
difference, that whereas the latter presented the risen Christ, glorious with
God and on the point of coming to set up the Great Kingdom, the evangelical
catechesis presents the Christ, the Kingdom and the Good News in quite another
light. In the eschatological teaching the epiphany of the Messiah has yet to
come; in the gospel teaching this epiphany is antedated, and considered as
already effected in and by the earthly life of its hero; this earthly epiphany,
coming to its climax in the death and resurrection of Jesus, is what the
evangelical catechesis now offers. This anticipation corresponds to a general
move forward in belief, to the need of defending the faith, and to the
transformation of the primitive Gospel into a mystery of salvation incorporated,
so to say, with the present life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the light of these observations we now venture upon an analysis of the
four evangelical books, beginning with that which all probabilities indicate as
the oldest, that is, the Gospel according to Mark.</p>
<P>
<center><font size=+1>THE FIRST PHASE OF THE MARCAN CATECHESIS</font></center>
<p>An unprejudiced reader of our second Gospel could not fail
to recognize that it contains, beneath a certain superficial unity, a
conglomerate of incoherent materials which ill disguise the additions made to an
original form or the transformations it has undergone, and this in cases where
the material is of most im-

</p>
<p align="center">78

</p>
<p>portance. We may, without much difficulty, distinguish two
parts in the Gospel; one may be called the baptismal catechesis in which the
epiphany of the Christ is begun in the baptism of Jesus by John; the second,
which may be called the catechesis of the Communion Supper, or of the saving
death, may be said to open with the confession of Peter and to be completed on
the discovery of the empty tomb, offered as material proof that Jesus rose from
the dead. It is obvious that here we must confine ourselves to pointing out the
features that are most striking and the contradictions most evident.

</p>
<p>First of all, that the epiphany of the Christ, and the
catechesis are strictly confined to his public life. Accordingly, the messianic
consecration of Jesus is effected, or seems to be, by his baptism or on the
occasion of it. The presentation of John the Baptist (Mark i, 1-8) serves as the
needed preamble to this baptism, a preamble embarrassed by the fact that the
covering prophecy, quoted as coming entirely from Isaiah (xl, 3) comes, as to
its first part, from Malachi (iii, i), thereby betraying the overlapping text
from Malachi as a surcharge. The account of John the Baptist is obviously
intended to present him as a forerunner subordinate to the Christ, and his
baptism as an empty sacrament, prelude to Christian baptism in the Holy Spirit
— a distinction imagined after the event and ill concealing the original
identity of the two rites. Moreover, Matthew (iii, 7-12) and Luke (iii, 7-9; 16-18) having here a more extended text, original in relation to Mark, the
presumption is that Mark depends on their source; in other words, that the
account of John the Baptist is a later addition in Mark's catechesis. In like
manner the story of the temptation in the wilderness gives the impression of
being a shorter account original in relation to Matthew (iv, 1-11; cf. Luke iv,
1-13). All the features in this picture of Jesus presented as Messiah at his
baptism betray the antedating of the messianic consecration, which the earlier
eschatological catechesis reserved for the risen Jesus. At this stage of the
catechesis it is at his baptism that God says to him: &quot;Thou art my beloved
son; in thee I am well pleased&quot; and not, as in the Apocalypse of Peter,
after his resurrection (cf. supra, p. 52).

</p>
<p>Looking closely into the matter, it is perfectly natural
that, in the early rudiments of the Gospel catechesis, Jesus should be 

</p>
<p align="center">79

</p>
<p>represented as making his first appearance at the moment
when his public ministry began, and that afterwards the feeling should arise
that this was also the right moment to explain the initial relations between
John and Jesus, between John's baptism and Christian baptism by interpreting
John's providential mission as preliminary to the higher messianic mission of
Jesus. Moreover, the descent of the Spirit into Jesus seems to be understood,
not as a simple operation of the Spirit, but as the realization of an immanence
of the Spirit which, in Jesus, was itself his higher being, the very person, we
might say, of the Son of Man, of Christ the Saviour. The description of the
descent as &quot;like a dove&quot; marks the perceptible individuality of this
Spirit.

</p>
<p>Next in order comes the calling of the first disciples (i,
16-20) whom Jesus is deemed to have intended for apostles. Another anticipation.
We shall have many occasions to remark that the apostolate was originally
understood as instituted by Jesus when risen from the dead, and in place of its
institution after his death we shall find the myth of the miraculous draught of
fishes during his lifetime.

</p>
<p>Mark appears to be specially interested in the thaumaturgic
activity of Jesus, and chiefly with the cure of the demoniacs, whose evil
spirits recognize the messianic quality of their exorcist. It is no part of our
purpose to discuss these cases from the pathologist's point of view, nor their
relation to the real history of the Galilean prophet, a history which the
documents withhold from our grasp and which it is not their object to narrate.
Whoso will may believe that Jesus cured many of these madmen, exorcising their
evil spirits, who loudly proclaimed him the Messiah, in spite of the constant
injunction laid on them to keep silence, lest he should be recognized. The
systematic intention of these stories is quite clear. In Mark i, 24 the man with
an unclean spirit says to Jesus: &quot;What is there in common between us and
thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Thou art come to destroy us! I know who thou art, the
Holy One from God.&quot; The cures of the demoniacs are offered as proofs of
Jesus' supernatural powers, confessed by the demons themselves. The fourth
Gospel, as we know, drops the argument and omits all these demoniac-cures. The
importance attached to them by the Synoptic catechesis is all the more
significant. Note that the cure of the Capernaum demoniac (i, 23-26, 27b) is
superimposed on the scene of the preaching in the synagogue (i, 21-22, 27a, 28)
and belongs, therefore, to a secondary layer of editorial deposits (as also i,
34b and the last words of 39). Thus we may conclude that this earliest form of
Gospel catechesis was not completed <i>currente calamo</i> by a single author. On the
contrary it was a long time on the anvil.

</p>
<p>To commentators in search of its historical explanation
much embarrassment has been caused, more or less everywhere, by the silence
which Jesus enjoined on the cured demoniacs, on the sick whom he healed (i,
32-34), on individual witnesses of his miracles and sometimes on his disciples,
a silence which the Gospel editors declare to have been actually kept in regard 

</p>
<p align="center">80 

</p>
<p>some of the events they have just recorded. But the
explanation is quite easy, not indeed by any circumstances attending the
ministry of Jesus, but by those of the Gospel catechesis in the process of its
formation. Our Gospel catechesis was first drawn up with an eye to the
eschatological catechesis, already in being, in which Jesus was exalted to
Messiahship when he ascended to God, and not till then. From the moment his
epiphany as Messiah was thrown back into his public ministry on earth an
explanation became necessary of these marvellous novelties, now heard of for the
first time as belonging to the activity of the Christ before his saving death.
The silence repeatedly enjoined on these occasions was the explanation, naive
enough, but indispensable, of why they had not been heard of before.

</p>
<p>It is not surprising, then, that Jesus has to withdraw
himself from the crowds of sick folk flowing into Capernaum. He resolves to
preach elsewhere, his mission being essentially that of a teacher (i, 35-39).
This is required because moral instruction must have its place in the catechesis
under elaboration. Hence the place assigned to it beside the miracles.

</p>
<p>The healing of the leper (i, 40-45) takes place in a
setting of Jewish legalism and under injunction to keep silent; the story, as
arranged by its editor, is clearly that of the day at Capernaum told over again
in another form, and with the same deep significance — the ministry of
salvation brought by the Christ to the Jews.

</p>
<p>There follows a series of anecdotes in which Jesus is shown
in conflict with the Pharisees, a conflict whose real background

</p>
<p align="center">81

</p>
<p>consists of certain later points of friction with Jewish
legalism, and belongs to a time when the Christian sect was already separated
from the main stock of Judaism. The paralytic of Capernaum is the first case
(ii, 1-12), editorially constructed as a miracle of healing, on which has been
grafted a declaration addressed by Jesus to the Pharisees concerning the power
&quot;of the Son of Man to forgive sins on the earth&quot; (ii, 5b-10). In
Mark's Gospel the Son of Man is identified with the Christ of mystery, who by
his death has paid the penalty of human sin; a conception which corresponds to
an important stage in the growth of the Gospel catechesis, though perhaps not
the earliest.

</p>
<p>The second case is the association of Jesus with publicans
and sinners (ii, 15-17); these are they who need salvation; it justifies the
mission to the Gentiles. The third is the question of fasting (ii, 18-22); the
answer of Jesus inclines to allegory; his disciples will have their fast-days in
commemoration of his death (19-20)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>—
a touch which dates the invention of the incident. The following sentences
present Jewish legalism as outworn, another mark indicating an origin long after
the age called apostolic. The fourth case presents two anecdotes about the
Sabbath aimed at rabbinical casuistry; the first is the story of the ears of
corn, in which the disciples are defended by the example of David and by the
rational aphorism: &quot;The Sabbath was made for man,&quot; etc., capped by the
saying not in line with the preceding: &quot;So that the Son of Man is Lord even
of the Sabbath,&quot; meaning that the Christ of mystery can dispense his
followers from a sabbatical observance. The second sabbath-story presents a
miraculous cure (iii, 1-6) justified by the right and duty of everyone to do
good at all times. Our catechesis is here attacking official Judaism on the
highest ground. But note how this whole bloc of stories is concluded (iii, 6):
the Pharisees take counsel with the Herodians how they might destroy Jesus. All
the cases we have been considering are grouped from a point of view which looks
back on the death of the Christ as a past event. In its first stage the Gospel
catechesis did not place them as far away from that termination as they are in
the passages now before us.

</p>
<p>In the chapters that follow we find a good deal of matter
that is, in truth, little more than padding. First come two short scenes, of
which one presents the beneficent activity of the

</p>
<p align="center">82

</p>
<p>Christ (iii, 7-12) and the other the choice of the Twelve
(13-19). In the actual arrangement of the stories, the first seems to prepare
the way for the dispute about the exorcisms here placed after the intervening
choice of the apostles. Matthew and Luke use it as preamble to the great
discourse which appears in Matthew as the Sermon on the Mount. Obviously a piece
of no historic significance which the Gospel draughtsmen could insert wherever
they found it convenient. The choice of the Twelve, which is represented as
taking place &quot;on the mountain,&quot; was not made at the very beginning, as
here depicted. The Twelve, who we are here told were chosen as apostles at the
side of Christ during his lifetime, were not so elected even after his death.
They were the leaders of the first believing group in Jerusalem, and were only
transformed into apostles by a later legend which at first opposed them to Paul
and put them above him. In other parts of Mark's Gospel we shall find their
importance deliberately belittled. Whence the presumption that the two short
scenes now in question are additions of later date to the catechesis named after
Mark.

</p>
<p>The dispute about the exorcisms makes an unnatural breach
in the story of the attempt by the family of Jesus to bring him back into the
house (iii, 20-21 and 31-35). The disputants are nascent Christianity and Jewish
doctrine, and their dispute turns on the probative value of Christian exorcisms.
If the move made by the family be taken as historical, it reflects no honour on
his kindred, whom Jesus himself is made to repudiate on the spot. The story may
be taken as relatively an old one. But may it not be intended as a figure of the
Jewish attitude towards Jesus, who has found outside official Judaism a new
family in his faithful believers? None the less this group of sayings, motived
by ill-will, has been carefully put together. As it has no attachments to what
precedes or follows it must have been placed where it is for amplification of
the narrative.

</p>
<p>A point of difficulty not to be passed over in silence is
the mention of sin against the Spirit, which is said to be the only sin that is
unforgivable (iii, 28-30). This declaration is in keeping with a particular
conception of the Spirit, and of its role in the Church, of which no explanation
is given in our texts. Although the editors of Mark have tried to integrate it
with the dispute

</p>
<p align="center">83

</p>
<p>about exorcism, its presence there is adventitious. Luke
(xii, 10) gives it as an isolated saying among others concerning the action of
the Spirit. Matthew (xii, 31-32) attaches it, like Mark, to the dispute about
exorcism, but gives it rather different form, identical in the main, with the
reading in Luke. While Mark distinguishes blasphemy against the Spirit, alone
punishable, from blasphemy in general, Matthew and Luke declare &quot;a word
against the Son of Man&quot; to be a pardonable offence, in contrast to
blasphemy against the Spirit, for which there is no pardon. There is no proof of
any kind that Mark's reading is primitive in relation to Matthew's and Luke's,
of which it is rather a deliberate attenuation. What we need to know is how the
difference between blasphemy against the Son of Man and blasphemy against the
Spirit can have been conceived. There is no reason to have recourse to Montanism
for the explanation of this singular feature. It was in opposition to the
&quot;spiritual men&quot; of gnostic theory that the Church declared itself the
depository and dispenser of the Spirit (cf. Acts viii, 18-24), and sin against
the Spirit is committed by him who denies the Church that privilege. The saying
thus fits in with the notion of the Spirit as replacing the Christ in the
guidance of the Church. We must therefore regard it as an element of secondary
origin and a relatively late addition to the Synoptic catechesis (cf. supra, p.
44).

</p>
<p>Another conglomerate, of which the elements are more or
less erratic, consists of parabolic discourses (iv, 1-34). Here the drafting
seems to have passed through several stages. A first edition had assembled
certain parables as a specimen of Jesus' teaching, that of the Sower and that of
the Seed, with a preamble and appropriate conclusion (iv, 1-9; 21-29, 33). A
second has inserted, after the parable of the Sower, an aside addressed by Jesus
to the disciples in explanation of the parable (iv, 10, 13-20) and perhaps the
parable of the Mustard Seed and other sentences (iv, 21-25; 30-32), taken from
the collection of Jesus' oracles which must be assumed as a common source of the
three Synoptics. Between the demand for explanation and the commentary on the
Sower, a final edition has lodged a reflection on the object of parables in
general, which is said to be that of causing the blindness of the Jews predicted
by Isaiah (vi, 9-10), while it is given&quot; to the disciples alone to
&quot;understand the mystery of the

</p>
<p align="center">84

</p>
<p>Kingdom of God.&quot; This mystical interpretation of the
parables along with &quot;the mystery&quot; in which we are to look for their
inner meaning, is a belated final touch. The parabolic mode of utterance, which
was common among the rabbis of the time, has nothing in it to cause blindness,
and the parable of the Sower is to be commended for the ease with which it can
be applied to the results of Gospel preaching. But it is in regard to the
mystery of salvation by the death of the Christ that parables are deemed to have
become a cause of blindness to them that are without meaning, no doubt, the Jews
in particular and unbelievers in general. In other passages of Mark we find that
the Galilean disciples themselves are not immune to this blindness. Perhaps that
is the reason why the request for explanation (iv, 10) is so strangely
attributed to the people who were about Jesus &quot;with the disciples.&quot;

</p>
<p>The discourse in parables is followed by four miracles,
appeasement of the tempest (iv, 35-41), cure of the madman at Gerasa (v, i-20),
raising of Jairus' daughter and cure of the woman with an issue of blood (v,
21-43). These form a group the members of which are apparently bound together,
though the group as a whole stands isolated in the compilation. The stories are
full of life, but of life given to them by the faith and imagination of the
narrator rather than by the precision of real memories or by intimate connection
between the parts of the action. That they are not, in some degree, legendary
reproductions of incidents that really happened cannot be rigorously
demonstrated; still less can it be disproved that they are largely constructed,
according to pre-existing types, to the glory of the Christ; the first of them
giving pre-eminence to power over the elements presented under the figure of his
role as Saviour, and especially his presence with the Church in the days to
come; the second, power over the demons and their master, in conditions which
symbolize the conversion of the pagans; while the third, in its double recording
(cleansing of a woman affected with perpetual impurity and raising of a dead
girl to life), presents the Saviour's role which, by faith, procures both pardon
and immortality for mankind.

</p>
<p>It cannot be said that this symbolism is a gratuitous
supposition on our part. For the evangelist and for his first readers the chief
interest of these stories lay precisely in the symbolism.

</p>
<p align="center">85

</p>
<p>There too, is the only reasonable explanation and the only
possible justification of two indisputable facts which force themselves upon us
in spite of ourselves: the extreme poverty of the evangelical legend in
narratives considered as such, and the not less extreme incoherence, together
with the artificial and arbitrary character of the literary construction. The
two things that mattered most to the success of the catechesis in the attainment
of its object were moral instruction and the education of faith. With this end
in view the evangelists were able to find, or to put into their more or less
fictitious narratives, the depth of meaning which they had discovered or
introduced with the parables. No complicated method is needed to understand it,
and it can be proved without endless research.

</p>
<p>The four miracles are followed by a series of incidents
still worse adjusted each to other than their predecessors. First comes the
fruitless preaching of Jesus &quot;in his own country&quot; (vi, 1-6), a
repetition in some respects of his preaching at Capernaum (i, 21- 22; 270-28),
but here turned so as to figure the failure of Christian propaganda among the
Jews; it probably contains nothing to guarantee historical tradition except the
indications about the family of Jesus. The mission of the apostles (vi, 7-13)
duplicates that previously mentioned (iii, 13-15), but in the present context,
with an abridgment of the discourse which Matthew and Luke (x, 1-16) give in
extenso, it figures Christian propaganda among the Gentiles. The story of John
the Baptist's death (vi, 17-29) is legendary throughout. Introduced most
unnaturally by statements put into the mouth of Antipas (vi, 15-16, an
enlargement of viii, 28) and violently wedged in between the mission of the
Twelve and their return, it might seem to be wholly without purpose. But, for
the Gospel editor v/ho inserts such a passage, the object in view would be, not
to record the death of John as a matter of interest belonging to the narrative,
but to hint that his burial was the end of him, a rather summary way of
disowning any relation of Jesus and Christianity with John and the sect which
survived him.

</p>
<p>The first multiplication of loaves, for which the return of
the disciples prepares the ground, is a symbolic miracle if ever there &quot;was
one, and we are repeatedly told that the disciples understood nothing of its
meaning (vi, 52; viii, 21). It represents the oldest

</p>
<p align="center">86

</p>
<p>myth of the institution of the Christian communion meal,
not yet arrived at the eucharistic theory in which the saving death of the
Christ was mystically signified in breaking the bread-body and distributing the
wine-blood of Jesus, but at the earlier stage when the Father was praised for
the life and knowledge which &quot;he has made known by his servant&quot; Jesus,
as in the Didache (ix, 2 and x, 2).

</p>
<p>Welded on, as best might be, to what goes before, comes the
miracle of walking on the water. The symbolism is analogous to that of the
calmed tempest (iv, 35-41) which it duplicates, the construction showing
influence from the first stories of so-called tradition about apparitions of
Jesus after his resurrection. In that respect it antedates material which
belonged originally to the eschatological catechesis, images of the invisible
presence of the Christ among the faithful as they waited for his second coming.

</p>
<p>The next passage, relating to the coming of Jesus to
Gennasar, or Gennesareth (vi, 53-56), is a transition piece, an interlude loaded
with miracle, which betrays the editorial hand but has no significance peculiar
to itself. It forms a natural introduction to the anecdote of the Syro-phenician
woman (vii, 24-30) from which it is cut off by the dispute about the washing of
hands. This dispute is a fragment of anti-Jewish polemic for which this was
probably thought to be the best place. Like the discourse in parables, it is
built up on some sayings attributed to the Christ (vii, 9-i2; 14-15), the last
of them imparting moral instruction in terms rather gross. This has been
overlaid with a gloss (vii, 3-4), a prophetic quotation (6-8) and an admonitory
explanation, the whole tending to make Jesus proclaim the futility of Jewish
prohibitions and scruples about food.

</p>
<p>The miracle of a cure operated at a distance, in response
to the mother's prayer, on a girl possessed by a devil, the mother being a woman
of the country and said to be Syro-phenician, forms a counterpart to the story
of the Roman centurion in the other two Synoptics (Matthew viii, 5-13; Luke vii,
1-10) and signifies in like manner that nations never visited by Jesus, as the
Jews have been visited, will be saved by him. The cure of the deaf-mute in the
country of the Decapolis is a miracle operated for symbolic reasons in pagan
territory, which are also the reasons for the utterly unintelligible itinerary
which the narrative makes Jesus

</p>
<p align="center">87

</p>
<p>follow between the two miracles of multiplied loaves. This
cure of the deaf-mute, peculiar to Mark, is counterpart to that of the blind man
at Bethsaida (viii, 22-26), the two being cut out on the same model. Both must
be attributed to an editor of Mark who may have freely exploited some deposit of
written or oral tradition or may himself have constructed the two stories with a
view to the lesson to be drawn from them, on the lines of other Gospel
narratives or of the practice commonly followed by exorcist-healers in those
times.

</p>
<p>No argument is needed to prove that the second miracle of
multiplication is a duplicate of the first. It may have been imagined to figure
the initiation of the Gentiles into the Christian mystery; or it may be that
another version of the first miracle has been utilized for that purpose. At all
events it is not by chance that in the first multiplication twelve baskets full
of fragments are left over, twelve being the cypher for Israel, and
corresponding to the Twelve who first governed the community of Aramean-speaking
believers in Jerusalem, while in the second miracle there are seven baskets, the
cypher for the Gentiles, corresponding to the Seven presiding over the group of
hellenist believers whose dispersion after the death of Stephen set on foot the
propagation of the Gospel outside Palestine and among the pagans. It is
noteworthy that the second multiplication does not occur in the third Gospel,
and that the stories are omitted which Mark has lodged between the first and the
confession of Peter: whence we may infer that this long section of Mark (vi, 45
to viii, 26) belongs to a late stage in the development of our Gospel.

</p>
<p>As though to explain and justify the future reprobation of
the mass of the Jews the evangelist has introduced, after a second
multiplication of loaves, a sentence about the Pharisees asking for signs, in
which Jesus refuses the sign demanded (viii, 11-12). This trait comes from a
source known to Matthew (xii, 38-40; cf. xvi, 4) and to Luke (xi, 29-30). But in
the source the sign mentioned is the sign of Jonah. Did our evangelist reflect
that the sign of Jonah, that is the sign of the resurrection, did not take place
for the Jews? It is more probable that the sign of Jonah, which was made much of
at the first, soon became embarrassing with its three days and three nights,
which could not be 

</p>
<p align="center">88

</p>
<p>fitted into the liturgical framework adopted by most
churches in the second century for commemoration of the Passion and the
Resurrection. The liturgical framework being interpreted as a chronology in
which Jesus rose the third day after his death it was difficult to see how he
could have spent three days and three nights in the tomb, like Jonah in the
belly of the fish.

</p>
<p>Thinking it appropriate to follow this up by a reflexion of
his own, on the first disciples' lack of understanding in presence of the
mystery of salvation, our editor attaches it to a saying about the leaven of the
Pharisees, which the collection of logia places in another context (cf. Luke
xii, i^), his object being to make Jesus unsuccessfully hint to the disciples
that the two multiplications signify the inexhaustible gift of salvation:
whereas the disciples were thinking only of food to put into their mouths. As an
historical record it is of no value. But the indication it gives of ill-will
towards the Galilean disciples is important and should be kept in mind.

</p>
<p>The cure of the blind man at Bethsaida (viii, 22-26) has
also a symbolic value, but falls into another current. It serves as introduction
to Peter's confession and seems intended to figure the progressive education of
the first disciples, their adhesion to the messianic faith and the origin of the
Jewish-Christian community. If we refer to the third Gospel, where Peter's
confession follows on immediately after the multiplication of loaves (Luke ix,
10-21), it would seem that the version of Mark which the writer to Theophilus
has reproduced presented the two events in the same close succession, and
localized both the miracle and the confession at Bethsaida. A complete
misunderstanding of the character and origin of our documents is shown by those
critics who explain the relation between Mark and Luke, in this part of the two
Gospels, by supposing that Luke was making use of an accidentally mutilated copy
of Mark. Is it, then, so natural that Mark, in its earliest form, had the
multiplication of loaves and the calming of the tempest, etc., twice over? In
these matters the simplest hypotheses are not always the best. To be sure,
canonical Mark is a very slender document; nevertheless it shows no lack of
duplications, re-shapings, overlays and editorial superfluities.

</p>
<p align="center">89

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">SECOND PHASE OF THE MARCAN CATECHESIS</font>

</p>
<p>With the confession of Peter (viii, 27-30) we enter on the
second part of the Gospel catechesis, the cycle of the Last Supper, and
encounter at the outset an almost certain antedating of an element fundamental
in the eschatological catechesis, namely Peter's faith in Jesus-Messiah, in
Jesus-Christ. No account need be taken of the preamble (viii, 27-28) which has
already served to introduce the legend of John the Baptist (vi, 14-16). The
essential element is the messianic confession of Simon: &quot;Thou art the
Christ.&quot; As in all similar cases, the imposition of silence on the
disciples (viii, 30) is a sure sign that material of post-resurrection origin is
being thrown back into the record of Jesus' ministry on earth. Whatever the
historical preparation may have been for Peter's faith in Jesus as the Christ,
his first affirmation of that faith was not made until, in his belief, Jesus was
already risen as the Christ. That granted, we may be sure that the natural
sequel, and probably the original sequel, to Peter's confession is to be found
in the declaration of Jesus (ix, 1), with all restriction removed, &quot;Those
who are here shall see the coming of God's kingdom,&quot; intimating that the
Great Event is at hand. Attached to this is the disciples' question about the
preliminary coming of Elijah, with the answer given by Jesus (ix, 11-13):
&quot;Elijah indeed is already come, and they have done to him what they would,
as it is written of him,&quot; to be understood of the ministry of John
conceived as preliminary, not to the earthly ministry of Jesus, but to the
advent of Jesus-Messiah in the Kingdom of God. The insertions in the text
between these two eschatological utterances belong to the development of the
Gospel catechesis. Let us now consider these in turn.

</p>
<p>The first insertion (viii, 31-38) opens with the first
announcement of the passion and resurrection of the Son of Man, and we are told
that the announcement was made publicly, in contrast to what just before has
been indicated concerning the Messiahship of Jesus. Now the Son of Man is
constantly, in our Gospel, the Messiah who redeems mankind from sin by his
saving death; he is the Christ of the salvation-mystery as presented in the
gnosis of the Epistle to the Romans. There follows, on the announcement, a
vigorous protest from Peter, who has understood nothing 

</p>
<p align="center">90

</p>
<p>of the mystery's economy, with the yet more vigorous
reprimand of Jesus: &quot;Get thee gone, Satan!&quot; etc. (viii, 31-33). This
episode plainly to Peter's discredit, falls into the current of mystical gnosis
and is in line with the invectives launched in the Pauline Epistle against the
old disciples, reputed apostles and treated as Judaizers. After this comes a
general call to renunciation as a normal condition of salvation (viii, 34-38);
this is a gloss of the evangelist on sayings taken from the collection of logia,
an oracle of some Christian prophet speaking in the name of Jesus (cf. x 38-39;
32-33). Taken by themselves these sayings in the logia already implied the
obligation laid upon the believer to become united mystically and morally with
the risen Christ, if he would be recognized by Jesus when he came in his glory.

</p>
<p>The second insertion (ix, 2-10) is the miracle of the
Transfiguration, an antedating of the exaltation of Jesus as the Christ, of his
assumption into glory, as taught in the eschatological catechesis. Here the
final exaltation is reduced to a provisory miracle, prelude to the final glory.
The antedating is again betrayed by the charge to keep silence, which we are
told was kept by the three witnesses of the miracle. These witnesses were chosen
with a purpose in view; because this abbreviated miracle could not be
conveniently presented as a public spectacle, and also because it was designed
to exhibit the three disciples as witnesses who did not understand what they
saw, aiming especially at Peter, who is credited with the absurd notion of
domiciling Jesus, Moses and Elijah on the mountain by building three tents for
them to live in (cf. supra, pp. 53-4).

</p>
<p>The miracle of the epileptic (ix, 17-29), artificially co-ordinated
with the miracle of the Transfiguration, is a common case of exorcism, but
strongly dramatized, with a view to emphasizing the power of true faith, in
presence of the mighty and beneficent Christ, the incredulity of the Jews and
the impotence of the disciples. The mention of a journey incognito across
Galilee serves to bring in a second prediction of the Passion (ix, 31-32),
presented as not understood by the disciples, and for the same reason.

</p>
<p>There follows a series of lessons the interconnection of
which is not easily grasped; they must have been taken from the collection of
logia, and compose a catechesis mainly ethical, which the

</p>
<p align="center">91

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">ANALYSIS OF THE GOSPEL CATECHESIS IN MARK</font>

</p>
<p>Gospel editors have framed in their usual manner. First
comes the lesson of apostolic service, conceived as having been provoked by the
preposterous claims of the disciples — another point not intended to enhance
their glory — and combined with instruction on the obligation to receive the
least of the Christ's people and the advantage that follows from receiving him
as one who is the Christ himself and God in the Christ (ix, 36-37). Next the
saying: &quot;Who is not against us is with us,&quot; strange counterpart to
&quot;who is not with me is against me&quot; in the collection of logia (Matthew
xii, 30; Luke xi, 23) here brought in as conclusion to the anecdote about the
unqualified exorcist (ix, 38-40), together with the saying about the cup of
water given in the name of the Christ (ix, 41; cf. Matthew x, 42) — the whole
permeated by the spirit of mystical gnosis. Next, propositions about scandal and
the punishment in store for him who causes it (ix, 42), and on scandal already
experienced, which must not continue, on pain of Gehenna. Finally, the metaphor
of the savourless salt with the appropriate lesson (ix, 49-50).

</p>
<p>From this example, one of many others, we are able to see
that the Gospel editors proceeded in their work as if the sayings they utilized
were teachings whose sense was not very clearly defined, and whose connections
of time and place in the life of Jesus could be laid down at will, for the
simple reason that nothing whatever was known about the matter. We have already
remarked how they operated in the same way with the facts adorning their
narratives. By these proceedings they were able to construct and fill out a
legend, astonishingly poor in real memories; into the artless mosaic before us,
whose incoherence is ill-disguised by the manifold devices of the editors to
provide it with a containing frame.

</p>
<p>The itinerary of the journey to Judea is vague enough, and
the editor, in search of matter to garnish it, found to hand the question of
divorce (x, 1-12), the saying about children, with whose simplicity men should
accept the announcement of the Kingdom (x, 13-16), and the case of the rich
young man (x, 17-22), into which are brought the sayings about the difficulty of
salvation for the rich (x, 23-27) and the reward in store for those who have
left all for Christ (x, 28-31). The reprobation of divorce is a characteristic
feature of early Christianity. We are given the

</p>
<p align="center">92

</p>
<p>biblical ground for condemning divorce (x, 2-9), the origin
of which has still to be explained. The biblical argument is some fragment of
controversy on the subject; the reprobation is taken from the collection of
logia (cf. Matthew v, 32; Luke xvi, 18); the setting is artificial (cf. i
Corinthians vii, 10, where the reprobation seems derived from Christian
mysticism). The story of the children is the original version in relation to the
version which doubles it in ix, 36, but seems to have been conceived to enforce
the duty of receiving the announcement of the Kingdom with unquestioning
simplicity.

</p>
<p>Though not otherwise dated or localized, the anecdote of
the rich young man is more circumstantial, but, in spite of this, is
typical rather than historical. Even the saying: &quot;Why callest thou me good?
None is good save God&quot; is a mystic subtilty rather than a living trait; the
command to follow Jesus seems to carry, not a literal sense, but the moral sense
of initiation into the Christ and entry into the community of the believers,
while the reflections on the difficulty of salvation for the rich are made to
fit in with corresponding features in the narrative. Entirely second-hand and
artificial is the promise of double reward, in this world and the next, to those
who have followed Jesus, that is, to believers (x, 28-31). The source, derived
perhaps from the eschatological catechesis, probably contained the promise of
thrones to the twelve disciples, as arranged in the tradition which glorified
them (Matthew xix, 28; cf. Luke xxii, 30): the outlook toward the messianic
triumph has been replaced by the promise of reward for renunciation and by a
clear and detailed prophecy of the Passion (x, 33-34).

</p>
<p>Judging by the preamble to it (x, 32) and by the context of
it (x, 32-34) this prediction seems intended to introduce the Jerusalem cycle of
the Gospel legend; taken as a whole and in connection with what follows (the
request of James and John and the lesson of service, 35-45), it would seem to be
constructed on the idea of the messianic triumph, as we have just seen, but so
as to push it back in order to mark the conditions to be fulfilled before the
Great Event. After the two earlier prophecies of the Passion, the point made
prominent is the lack of understanding on the part of the disciples, especially
on Peter's. Here this lack of understanding is fixed

</p>
<p align="center">93

</p>
<p>upon James and John, and figured by their claim to the two
highest thrones on the right and left of the Christ. Jesus answers by announcing
their coming martyrdom and throwing back upon God the distribution of places in
the Kingdom; after which he turns to the disciples in a body and gives them the
lesson of service, of which all are supposed to be in need, supporting it with
the authority of his own example: &quot;The Son of Man is come to serve and to
give his life as a ransom for many.&quot; Both the pretensions of the disciples
and the lesson of service have been anticipated in the preceding cycle (ix,
33-35). This repetition and expansion of a lesson already given is yet another
witness to the poverty of the tradition. As we have just seen, the lesson of
service corresponds to the mystical conception of salvation by the death of the
Christ and to the age when the Christian community was organized. Its insertion
into the legend of Jesus is, therefore, artificially contrived. 

</p>
<p>The miracle at Jericho (x, 46-52) is presented under the
same conditions as the chief miracles in Galilee. It is a symbol and figure of
salvation, of the light given to faith. It is fittingly placed at the threshold
of the great mystery and may have been originally conceived as a fulfilment of
prophecy (Isaiah xxxv, 5). The story is otherwise isolated, and the narrator has
not thought of making it contribute to the coming outburst of enthusiasm on the
Mount of Olives. All the incidents in the Passion cycle of the Gospel are
presented as independent one of another, the reason being that they are not a
sequence of memories but are deduced, more or less, from biblical texts.

</p>
<p>Clearly, also, the messianic triumph on the Mount of Olives
(xi, 1-10) has been constructed on certain Old Testament texts (cf. Zechariah
ix, 9; Psalm cxviii, 26; Genesis xlix, 11). The localization of the incident is
in like manner related to a text in prophecy (Zechariah xiv, 4). Have we not
already seen the Mount of Olives chosen for the messianic exaltation (supra, p.
54)? The invention of the preliminaries in Mark is&quot; a masterpiece of
childlike invention (xi, 1-6).

</p>
<p>In what follows an artificial time-order is constructed to
serve as frame for the events narrated and the teachings recorded. This
time-order may well be in direct relation with the ritual commemoration of the
events described, which are presented in their

</p>
<p align="center">94

</p>
<p>mystical meaning 'and value, and not in the order of their
real historical sequence, so far as they can be said to belong to that order at
all.

</p>
<p>The cursing of the fig tree (xi, 12-14) and its effect (xi,
20-21) separated the one from the other, sit awkwardly astride on the expulsion
of the traders, an independent story, conceived as a fulfilment of prophecy
(Malachi iii, 1; Zechariah xiv, 21), like the messianic triumph, with which it
is logically co-ordinate. The miracle of the fig tree is a symbolic act,
conceived in the same spirit as the parable of the fig tree (Luke xiii, 6-9), if
not constructed upon it, to represent the Christ's futile visit to Israel and
placed, with that intention, in connection with the arrival of Jesus in the
temple. But, with a view to amplifying the teaching of Jesus in Jerusalem, this
fiction is joined by the editors to the lesson of faith (xi, 22-23), taken from
the collection of login (cf. Matthew xvii, 20), which they have exploited in the
story of the epileptic (ix, 23-24; supra, p. 90). To this are added some words
on the certainty of an answer to prayer and on the need to pardon one's
neighbour in order to obtain pardon from God (xi, 24-26; cf. Matthew vii, 11;
xviii, 19; Luke xi, 5-13; xviii, 1-8).

</p>
<p>By an editorial combination the question of the priests (xi,
27-33) seems to be related to the expulsion of the traders, as the latter is
more or less attached to the messianic triumph (xi, 12-14 makes a place for the
cursing of the fig tree before the expulsion of the traders, while xi, 18-19 is
a general remark originally conceived as the conclusion of the Jerusalem
stories). In answer to the priests' demand for the authority on which he claimed
to act, Jesus is made to pose an embarrassing question about the baptism of
John. To discuss its historical probability would be wasted time; it bears
witness to the link which originally existed between Christianity and the sect
founded by John, to the advantage which Christian apologetic sought to derive
from it and to the purely rabbinical subtilty of the argument when first
started. Originally the incident must have figured among the savings about John
the Baptist, of which the main body is preserved in Matthew xi, 2-19 and Luke
vii, 19-35.

</p>
<p>The natural conclusion of this story would be the retreat
of the questioners (xii, 12: &quot;And leaving him they departed&quot;), who

</p>
<p align="center">95

</p>
<p>thereupon send some of the Pharisees to trap him over the
question of tribute. Between the anecdote and this conclusion someone has
intercalated the parable of the Wicked Husbandmen (xii 1-11)5 a short apocalypse
which turns on the fall of Jerusalem, the evangelization of the pagans and of
the assumption of Jesus into glory; a fragment of apologetic in the style of the
discourses attributed in Acts to the first Christian preachers, and even ending
with the usual quotation of the apologists (Psalm cxviii, 22-23). This must be
the work of some Christian prophet, utilized at first as the conclusion of the
Jerusalem ministry (note the correspondence of xii, 120: with xiv, 1-2) before
being replaced for that purpose by the great apocalyptic discourse (xiii). 

</p>
<p>The question and answer about tribute to Caesar is intended
to prove that the Christ was not a rebel against Roman authority. It was
composed to prevent the Christians being classed with the Jewish Zealots, in
revolt against the empire. No such question arose for Jesus and the believers of
the first generation; but, when hopes of the Second Coming began to waver, the
timeliness of thus defining the principle involved is not hard to understand.

</p>
<p>Just as the question about tribute was conceived, for the
setting of the scene, as posed by the Pharisees in league with the Herodians, so
the question about the resurrection (xii, 14-27) is raised by the Saduccees,
people &quot;who say there is no resurrection,&quot; but here presented in a
body, whereas in the preceding case the precaution had been taken of bringing to
the front only some of the Pharisees and Herodians.&quot; The intention
evidently was to show Jesus in conflict at close quarters with the principal
Jewish sects. And yet no two things could belong to regions further apart than
this question and that of the tribute, since the point raised about the
resurrection is treated as a dispute of the schools, while the greater part of
the passage, both question and answer, might have been borrowed, just as it
stands, from Jewish scholastic. Nevertheless there are two elements in Jesus'
answer: a direct argument drawn from the actual conditions in the Kingdom of
God, and an argument derived from a mystical and spiritual conception of
immortality, which is the more remarkable in this passage by reason of its
incompatibility with the vulgar notion of the resurrection retained in the
corpus of the

</p>
<p align="center">96

</p>
<p>anecdote, and -which we shall presently see applied to the
Christ himself.

</p>
<p>Immediately following comes the Great Precept of love to
God and man, brought in, like its predecessors, without natural connection.
Taking the anecdote literally we should conclude that this principle, in which
many in our time have gone out of their way to find the essence of the Gospel,
was not announced by Jesus until he had to answer an academical question posed
for him by a scribe who wished to test the soundness of his judgment. Comparing
Mark's account of the incident with Luke xii 25-28, it seems that the story was
first constructed without any indication of place, and that the questioner
himself found the good answer to his question, Jesus merely praising him for
answering so well. This the tradition of Mark has transposed to the Jerusalem
ministry, and it is evident that the canonical version of the Gospel has been
arranged so as to put the first announcement&quot; of the great commandments in
the mouth of Jesus. At least it is clear that the Gospel editors were not
thinking about &quot;the essence of Christianity.&quot;

</p>
<p>The whole group of these arguments is wound up by the
saying: &quot;No man dared to ask him any more questions.&quot; The perspective
is conventional; for, between the announcement of the Kingdom and Jewish
authority, there was nothing to debate in matters of casuistry, morals or even
chronology. But our Gospel goes further. It exhibits Jesus as taking the
offensive and publicly raising the problem of the Christ (xii, 35-37). The
scribes say that the Christ is the son of David; but are not the scribes under
deception, seeing that David himself, in a text inspired by God (Psalm cx, i),
addressed him as his Lord?

</p>
<p>Tradition has here picked up, probably without
understanding, some story born in Christian circles in which the authority of
Scripture was invoked to get rid of the Messiah's Davidic descent, and
profession made that the Lord Christ had no need of descent from an earthly
king, if indeed he was humanly descended at all. So, once more, what we have
before us is an anticipation, in which Jesus himself is made to bring to light
the text which Christian tradition soon pitched upon as meaning that he was Lord
Christ, not by filiation to David, but became so by resurrection from the dead.

</p>
<p align="center">97

</p>
<p>The tradition of Mark has borrowed from the collection of
logia an abridgment of invectives against the Pharisees (xii, 38-40) just as it
borrowed from the same source an abridgment of the discourse on the apostolic
mission (this collection seems originally to have consisted in the main of moral
precepts and of anti-Jewish polemic, in keeping with the eschatological
catechesis). If, in these cases, more was not taken from the source, the reason
is that Mark's tradition makes no pretence to replace it, but rather indicates
it by way of reference.

</p>
<p>The story of the widow and her gift of two farthings (xii,
41-44) comes we know not whence. This story, which is of mediocre import, was
probably constructed on a theme previously known, and inserted here for the
simple reason that the compiler was in search of something more to say. It
attaches to nothing in the context, and has no analogy with the other incidents
grouped together as appropriate to the Jerusalem ministry.

</p>
<p>Finally comes the great apocalyptic discourse (xiii) of
which a detailed analysis would here be superfluous. Critics freely admit that
it is based on a short Jewish apocalypse earlier than the capture of Jerusalem
and the destruction of the Temple by Titus in 70: we may even assume that it
goes back to the time of Caligula. This Jewish apocalypse, adopted by the
Christians, has been filled out at various points, as much to enrich its moral
significance as to show that Jesus himself had revealed to his disciples that
many things must happen before the Great Event, by him announced as near at
hand. Needless to say the apocalypse in its Christian form is later than the
year 70, and that it was not elaborated all at once; the three Synoptics give it
in three different versions. All three attach the main prophecy to a special
prediction about the destruction of the Temple (Mark xiii, 1-2; cf. Matthew xxiv,
1-2, Luke xxi, 5-6). But Mark's tradition has a significant peculiarity in that
it makes Jesus address the discourse in private, as a secret, to the four
leading disciples — a proof that the Gospel catechesis at first knew nothing
of the discourse as forming part of Jesus' teaching at Jerusalem. It is yet
another fragment of the eschatological catechesis antedated in the evangelical.

</p>
<p>The summary impression left by the above analyses is to the
following effect. While the legend of the Galilean ministry,

</p>
<p align="center">98

</p>
<p>critically speaking, is extremely thin and artificially
constructed, the story of the Jerusalem ministry, in spite of all these
readjustments and additions, is even thinner and more artificial. Of the latter
legend almost nothing is matter of fact save the very point which tradition has
done its utmost to disguise, namely that Jesus came to Jerusalem as the herald
of the Great Event, fully confident that he would succeed, through the
intervention of God, in rooting out the rule of the foreigner and all the abuses
rampant in Israel. This is what he expected. What met him was the wooden stake
of crucifixion, unaccompanied by the extraordinary actions, discussions and
discourses recorded in the story before us.

</p>
<p>They waste their labour who search in the realm of
historical reality for the solution of a problem that belongs to the realm of
mystical speculation and religious myth-making. Such is the problem presented to
exegetes by the contradiction between the Gospels as to the day on which Jesus
suffered the death-penalty. According to the fourth Gospel it was the very day
on which the Jews sacrificed the paschal lamb: according to the first three it
was the next day, Jesus having eaten the Passover with his disciples on the day
before (cf. supra., pp. 23-24). Critical exegetes up to now have been slow to
recognize that this disagreement has nothing to do with the true day on which
the Passion took place as an historical event, a day unknown to both sides, but
corresponds to two divergent Easter observances between which the Christian
churches were divided in the second century, those of Asia, which kept Easter on
the same day as that on which the Jews kept the Passover, and the other, which
celebrated theirs on the following Sunday, the fourth Gospel being in line with
the Asiatic usage, called quartodeciman, while the Synoptics were in line with
the celebration on Sunday. It is intelligible, on general grounds, that the
first Christians should keep Easter on the same day as that on which the Jews
kept the Passover. It is also intelligible that very soon they began to find in
their Easter festival a sense peculiar to Christianity, in which the Jewish
commemoration, at the Passover, of Israel's liberation gave place to
commemorating the gift of salvation by Jesus Christ. Thus, for the churches of
Asia, Easter celebrated the saving and triumphant 

</p>
<p align="center">99

</p>
<p>death of the Lamb, the Lamb-Christ, the Lamb of God.
Nevertheless the custom established itself elsewhere, and gradually spread, of
transferring the Passion, now become the Christian Easter, to the Sunday, the
Lord's day, the day of the risen Christ, adopted as the day of resurrection on
which the work of salvation came to its crowning point, rather than on the day
of death, the commemoration of which was now attached to the preceding Friday,
while the institution of the eucharist, now become a mystic symbol of the saving
death, remained attached to the last meal of Jesus, understood as the paschal
meal. Thus the Gospel catechesis, in its two forms, canonized the quartodeciman
observance on the one side and the Sunday observance on the other. On neither
side was there any concern to fix the historical day on which Jesus suffered.
&quot;We do not even know the precise year of the Passion; little wonder then
that we are ignorant of the day. But let us first consider how Passion Week is
presented in Mark.

</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Passion in Mark</b>

</p>
<p>According to our Gospel (xiv, 1-2) two days before
&quot;the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Breads — this, in the language
of Mark and Matthew, might mean the previous day, that is, 13 Nizan, but
including in it what would be for us the evening of i2th — &quot;the high
priests and scribes&quot; decided to make an end of Jesus, but to avoid
arresting him during the festival, which might have provoked a tumult among the
people. The matter in hand, then, was to get the affair over before 14 Nizan,
the day of the feast. This preamble, which seems of ancient date in its present
place, does not agree with what follows. It naturally introduces, and should be
followed by, the plot hatched between the high priests and Judas for the secret
arrest of Jesus (xiv, 10-11). But between the two there has been intercalated
the scene of anointing at Bethany (3-9), lodged precisely in the place occupied
by the last meal of Jesus — the evening on which 13 Nizan began. The writer
having delayed this last meal in order to identify it with the Jewish Passover
— the evening on winch 14 Nizan began — has put another meal in place of
that originally indicated as the last; but, just as he introduces into the last
meal the symbolism of the saving death along with the institution of the mystic
Supper, so he introduces it into his

</p>
<p align="center">100

</p>
<p>duplicate of the last, making use perhaps of some story in
which a sinful woman pours ointment on Jesus (cf. Luke vii, 36-50). The inventor
of the scene in Mark was no admirer of the disciples who are here represented as
railing at the woman for wasting her money, while Jesus has to explain to them
the mystic sense of what she has done. It is interesting to note that the
statements of Jesus about &quot;the Gospel preached throughout the whole
world&quot; presupposes that the Gospel catechesis, to which the writer assigns
a place in the scene just constructed, has already taken a constituted form.

</p>
<p>Follows the bargain struck between the high priests and
Judas for the betrayal of Jesus (xiv, 10-11). The question may well be asked
whether the role assigned to Judas is not fictitious from beginning to end, a
symbol of Judaism as the villain of the piece. The truth is, as we shall see,
that the Judas-legend underwent continuous enlargement in Christian tradition,
and that Judas (if he ever existed) cannot have been one of the Twelve, since
the college of the Twelve was not instituted by Jesus. He is also an
embarrassment in the legend of the Twelve, which was first formed with no
knowledge of Judas. We have already called attention (supra, p. 92) to the
saying about &quot;the twelve thrones&quot; reserved in the Kingdom for Jesus'
companions (Matthew xix, 28): are we then to suppose that Judas was to occupy
one of them? A traitor being needed for the elaboration of the drama,
imagination invented the role of Judas and biblical texts were duly found to
give authority to the legend.

</p>
<p>The story of the last meal comes between the traitor's
compact and the arrest of Jesus (xiv, 12-31). The preliminary story (12-17) of
the finding of the guest chamber is a writer's fiction equally artless and cut
to the same pattern as that of the tied colt which introduces the messianic
triumph on the Mount of Olives (xi, 1-6). It was deemed appropriate to make
Jesus, as the meal proceeded, announce the coming treachery of which he was to
be the victim, the circumstances and form of the prediction showing that the
writer had in mind the text of Psalm xli, 9 (expressly quoted in John xiii, 18),
while the threat aimed at the traitor suggests that the evangelist was already
acquainted with some sombre legend about Judas, such as that in Matthew xxvii,
3-8 and Acts i, 16-19.

</p>
<p align="center">101

</p>
<p>The essential point of the meal lies in its mystical
relation with the Christian Supper, of which it is the prototype. But two
different conceptions of the Supper are present in the story, one superimposed
on the other. According to the earlier conception it was imagined that Jesus, in
the course of this his last meal, which was not the paschal meal, after
pronouncing the customary benediction on the bread and the cup, announced to the
disciples that their next meal together would be in the Kingdom of God (xiv,
25). In this type the Supper was understood as anticipating the fellowship of
the elect with the Christ in his Kingdom, an anticipation in which memory of
Jesus' death and resurrection is implied only. Upon this primitive and
eschatological meaning of the Supper, already figured in the miracle of the
multiplied loaves, the editing hand has grafted (xiv, 22-24) the conception of
the mystic Supper, according to which the bread becomes symbolically the body of
the Christ, and the wine his blood, the Supper being now understood as a rite of
holy communion with Jesus, redeemer of mankind by his death, as announced in i
Corinthians xi, 23-25. Note that, in this conception, the Christ is the paschal
lamb of the Christians, and that this was not the precise point of departure for
fixing Easter on Sunday. This in passing; what we have here to point out is the
editorial artifice of the superposition. The artifice is clearly perceptible in
Mark (xiv, 23-25):

</p>
<p>And taking the cup, after giving thanks, he gave it to
them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them: &quot;This is my blood of
the covenant, shed for many. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the
product of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the Kingdom of
God.&quot;

</p>
<p>When the disciples had drunk the wine, the time was past
for saying &quot;this is my blood,&quot; which is here made to follow the
drinking. The natural sequence after &quot;they all drank of it&quot; is &quot;I
will drink of it no more,&quot; etc. This was the order in the basis-story: it
spoke only of the bread that he would eat no more and of the wine that he would
drink no more till they ate and drank together in the Kingdom of God. The
institution of the mystic Supper (&quot;this is my blood,&quot; etc.) is a
highly distinct afterthought in the development of the Gospel catechesis.

</p>
<p>The meal over, the company withdraws to the Mount of

</p>
<p align="center">102

</p>
<p>Olives, and Jesus announces the defection of all the
disciples conformably to the prophecy in Zechariah xiii, 7, a prediction of
early date in the tradition, as is also the discovery of the suitable text. But
what follows (xiv, 28): &quot;But after my resurrection I will go before you
into Galilee&quot; is a palpable surcharge to bring in the discovery of the
emptied tomb, a fiction whose adventitious and later character is thus plainly
indicated. Another prediction is that of Peter's denial (xiv, 29-31). It is
obvious that the denial, if it really happened (or even if it did not), and the
defection or flight of the disciples must have formed part of the tradition
before it was deemed advisable to make the Christ predict them. But, in view of
the ill-will to the original Galilean disciples, and especially to Peter, which
characterizes one of the currents in Mark, it is permissible, in the one case as
in the other, not only to suspect, but to affirm, that even the story of the
denial has been invented at all points in the tradition of Mark, although it
seems to have been retouched on the last revision which attenuated Peter's
cowardice by his repentance (xiv, 72). After all, the blow hits Peter no harder
than the story of his protest at the first prediction of the Passion, or that of
his obstinate slumber during the threefold prayer in Gethsemane, in which the
offence is also thrice repeated. Indeed, the whole scene in Gethsemane, the
agony of the Christ in the Olive Garden, seems, when probed to its base, to rest
entirely on Psalm xxii (cf. Hebrews v, 7, a witness independent of our Gospels,
but not pointing to the scene in Gethsemane; cf. p. 46). In the Gospel before us
the whole story (xiv, 32-42) is given a turn which brings out the stupidity of
the three leading disciples in presence of the mystery of the redeeming death.
At the last moment (xiv, 42) another prediction, that of his coming arrest to
follow the betrayal of Judas, is attributed to Jesus.

</p>
<p>A rabble, recruited by the Sanhedrim in the middle of the
night and guided by the traitor, now lays hands on Jesus after brief resistance
by the disciples, in which a servant of the high priest has an ear cut off, the
evangelist giving prominence to the kiss of Judas, the sign agreed between him
and his following, and to Jesus' declaration that all has been providentially
arranged (xiv, 24-50) — the dramatic presentation of an event of which the
real conditions are unknown to us. Then comes the conclusion,

</p>
<p align="center">103

</p>
<p>which is primitive in relation to the rest: the disciples
take to flight in a body, abandoning Jesus to his fate; which contradicts what
is to be told us a little later on about Peter's proceedings and his denial.

</p>
<p>A trait peculiar to our Gospel which the others have not
retained doubtless thinking it insignificant, is the incident of a certain young
follower in the crowd who fled naked, leaving in the hands of his assailants the
cloth that covered him (51-52). Certain exegetes believe that this unknown and
mysterious youth can be identified with Mark in person. Far more probably the
incident is intended to fulfil a line of prophecy, &quot;the courageous among
the mighty shall flee away naked in that day&quot; (Amos ii, 16). It has been
said that such an application would be forced. Doubtless it would, but it is no
less likely for that reason. Can any application of prophecy be found hereabouts
which is not forced?

</p>
<p>The crucifixion of Jesus is explicable on one ground only:
he was sentenced to death and executed by the Roman authority as a sower of
sedition against itself, and simply so. The efforts of the traditional legend
have been concentrated on transferring responsibility for his death to the Jews,
and on doing this in such a way as to make it appear that the death sentence was
extorted from Pilate, or imposed upon him, while he, for his part, acknowledged
the perfect innocence of the accused. In pursuit of this purpose a sentence by
the Sanhedrim was imagined, and condemnation pronounced on the ground that Jesus
laid claim to be Son of God, that is, to the divine character which belonged to
him in the faith which accepted the Christian mystery. In this there is a double
anachronism: first, in view of the fact that the Sanhedrim, in the time of the
procurators, had retained full powers over the Palestinian Jews, except in
matters political; and, second, that Jesus, as all four evangelists are
compelled to admit, was condemned to death by Pilate on political ground as
&quot;King of the Jews,&quot; that is, to use equivalent terms, as a messianic
agitator laying claim to some kind of royalty in Israel subversive of the
imperial government. Historically the case of Jesus is intelligible only<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>if we admit from the outset that he was sentenced to death by Pilate
alone, acting as representative of Roman authority. Need we repeat once more
that our texts are in no way concerned

</p>
<p align="center">104

</p>
<p>with history in the strict sense of the term? Their object
is catechetical and, in a minor degree, apologetic.

</p>
<p>The fictitious account of the trial before the Sanhedrim
(xiv 55-65) is oddly entangled with Peter's denial (53-72) of which a beginning
is made in 53-54 and the rest of the story, given in 66-72. But, of the two
stories, that of the denial is the added one. The trial scene is constructed of
three elements easily distinguished: first, the evidence of the witnesses
(55-59) which agrees with the saying about the temple, which Jesus was accused
of boasting he would destroy and rebuild in three days, a saying which seems to
have caused considerable embarrassment in Christian tradition and which, if
really spoken, may have been brought up in evidence before Pilate as proof of
messianic pretensions; second, the declaration of Jesus affirming his character
as Son of God (60-64), brought in at that point to correct the impression given
by the condemnation of the pretended King of the Jews, and to account for this
condemnation by the blind fanaticism of the Jewish authorities in the presence
of the Christ of mystery, divine saviour of mankind; lastly, the scenes of
outrage (65) introduced for the accomplishment of prophecy, especially Isaiah 1,
6; liii, 3 (Septuagint). Peter's denial, in Mark's account of it, is complicated
by a double cock-crow. We get a glimpse of a simpler story behind it in which
the crowing of the cock was not a narrative detail, but an indication that it
was the third hour of the night (according to Roman usage) when the triple
denial was finished (cf. xiii, 35).

</p>
<p>The morning session of the Sanhedrim, held before Jesus is
led away to Pilate's court (xv, i), now duplicates the nocturnal session at
which he was condemned. Originally, in the tradition of the second Gospel, this
may have been the meeting at which the accusers concerted the charge to be
brought before Pilate. In the trial before the procurator nothing has real
consistence save the charge — that of pretending to messianic royalty. Our
Gospel (xv, 2-5) places the interrogation of the accused before the accusation,
in presence of which Jesus keeps silence, as he had done before the witnesses of
Caiaphas, and for the same reason — the fulfilment of Isaiah liii, 7. Pilate's
astonishment at his attitude is made to prepare the incident of Barabbas (6-15).
Whatever may be the source of this fiction, which defies all probability, the
aim

</p>
<p align="center">105

</p>
<p>of it is to relieve Pilate's responsibility, while
establishing the innocence of Jesus. Only at the last moment does the procurator
concede the order for execution which he is represented in like manner as not
being able to refuse in law, the verdict of the Sanhedrim having been given
according to rule. [1] Before handing Jesus over to the Jews, Pilate has him
scourged, after which there follows a scene of mockery in the pretorium, of
comic royalty probably in imitation of the ancient carnivals which ended in the
execution, sometimes pretended and sometimes real, of the carnival king. But
here probabilities are all against the reality of a scene which is conceived in
a fulfilment of a prophecy (Isaiah liii, 3-7) prefiguring the glory awaiting
Jesus as celestial King (cf. Hebrews ii, 9).

</p>
<p>Finally the soldiers, after divesting Jesus of his mock
purple, give him back his own clothes and lead him off to crucifixion (xv, 20);
to carry the cross, they lay hold of a bystander, Simon, a Cyrenian,
&quot;father of Alexander and Rufus&quot; (21). So precise a detail in a story
otherwise lacking in signs of clear memory, is somewhat surprising. The
precision may be affected, like the name of Jairus in the resurrection miracle
or that of Bar-Timaeus at Jericho. But the detail was not invented to signify
that the believer must carry the cross as he follows Jesus, since it is not
under compulsion, as here, that the cross must be carried: the object was rather
to spare Jesus the humiliation of carrying it. The sad procession goes on its
way and finally comes to a halt at a place called Golgotha, that is, Calvary
(xv, 22), which was probably the usual place for execution by this method.

</p>
<p>It seems likely that, in the story at the base of all this,
mention of crucifixion (24a) followed immediately on the arrival at Golgotha,
and that what is said further on about the inscription on the cross (26)
followed the fixation of the body. The incidents of the aromatic wine (23) and
the division of the garments (24b) mark the fulfilment of prophecies; the
indication of the hour (25) belongs to the writer's systematic time-scheme which
proceeds to divide the day of the Passion into four parts, the judgment of
Pilate taking place in the first quarter and the fixing to the cross m the
second — details connected with the ritual commemoration

</p>
<p>[1] File situation in which Pilate is thus placed is not
without analogy to that of certain &quot;Oman magistrates who, in the time of
the Antonines, found themselves compelled to sentence Christians to death
against their own conscience.

</p>
<p align="center">106

</p>
<p>rather than memories. The offering of aromatic wine may be
the first form under which the fulfilment of Psalm lxix, 21 was represented:
&quot;They gave me gall for meat and vinegar to slake my thirst&quot;; while the
refusal by Jesus was possibly suggested by verse 22 of the same Psalm. The
clothes of the executed criminal were the perquisite of his executioners, but
the evangelists mention it only as marking the fulfilment of Psalm xxii, 18. The
inscription bearing the charge is a detail of Roman usage; it is mentioned by
the evangelists in order that the cross may have above it the idea of messianic
royalty, and they have worded it accordingly. &quot;The King of the Jews&quot;
is the simple wording of our Gospel. The two thieves crucified with Jesus (27)
are mentioned to signify the fulfilment of Isaiah liii, 12, expressly cited in
the common text of Mark, though not in the oldest manuscripts. The incident was
suggested by the text. The passers-by who wag their heads in derision come from
Psalm xxii, 7; the insults of the Sanhedrim, who we might think had moved in a
body to Golgotha (31-32), adding themselves to those of the crowd (they seem to
be a late addition) are aimed at the Christ of faith, Saviour and Son of God
(cf. Psalm xxii, 8; Matthew xxvii, 43); while the reproaches of the two thieves
(32) are a climax to the ignominy, and complete the fulfilment of the Psalm (xxii,
7).

</p>
<p>Dense darkness envelops the scene and lasts for three
hours, from the sixth to the ninth. The darkness is an addition in Mark's
version; it comes from Amos viii, 9-10 (connect with the trait mentioned above,
p. 103). At the ninth hour Jesus cries with a loud voice in Aramean: &quot;My
God, my God, why hast thou abandoned me?&quot; Such a cry of distress, say some
of our modern critics, perhaps a little innocently, no one would ever have dared
to put into the mouth of Jesus had he not really uttered it. They are the first
words of Psalm xxii, which may be said to have guided the whole construction of
the Passion, and it is natural enough that the idea of putting the first words
of the Psalm on the lips of the dying Christ should occur at once to the
evangelists, not indeed as attributing to him any feeling of despair (!) but the
better to bring out the full realization of the Psalm, both in the incidents of
the Passion and in the mind of the Christ. The appeal to God (Eli) provokes a
paltry jest from a bystander about the name Elias, followed by the offering of
vinegar (another

</p>
<p align="center">107

</p>
<p>fulfilment of Psalm lxix, 21 supra cit.; cf. Psalm xxii,
16). Then Jesus, after emitting a great cry, breathes his last (37). In the
fundamental document this cry, which is inarticulate but of superhuman violence,
was the only cry mentioned, the quotation of Psalm xxii and what followed it
being added in the course of the Gospels formation. At the moment of death the
temple veil is rent from top to bottom and the centurion on guard cries out:
&quot;This man was the Son of God.&quot; The rending of the veil has the meaning
of Hebrews vi, 19-20; x, 19-20. It signifies the rupture of the &quot;veil which
was his visible flesh&quot; and the liberation of the Christ for his entry into
the heavenly sanctuary, there to make oblation of his blood and open the way for
believers into Eternal Life.

</p>
<p>The centurion's profession of faith is the evangelist's;
the witness also which the Gentiles render to Christ the divine. At the
beginning, and for some time afterwards, this must have been the conclusion of
the Gospel legend. Admirable conclusion and of high significance when rightly
understood! It means that the Christ, freed from his earthly covering of flesh,
enters immediately into the glory of his eternal life. His resurrection is
spiritual; it coincides with the moment of death; death and resurrection may be
commemorated simultaneously: the glorious death that saves mankind, the last
sigh of Jesus and the exaltation of the Lamb; the three coincident. And this,
clearly understood, will help us greatly to put the right value on the next
stage of the Gospel revision.

</p>
<p>What we now go on to read (xv, 40-xvi, 8) corresponds, in
general, to the later concept of a material resurrection of the body verified
the third day after the death of Christ. It would seem that there were present
on Calvary certain women, their existence unsuspected hitherto, who had
ministered to Jesus in Galilee and followed him to Jerusalem; we are told their
names (xv, 40-41). [1] According to our Gospel these women it was who
established the fact of the resurrection. But in order that a material
resurrection may take place a tomb must be indicated and suitable conditions
provided. Legend has provided them.

</p>
<p>So it happened that a certain Joseph of Arimathaea, a new-

</p>
<p>[1] The role assigned to these women in the service of the
Christ and his companions mat ot the widows who, in the earliest
times, ministered to the wants of the Christian communities.

</p>
<p align="center">108

</p>
<p>comer on the scene and as unexpected as the women, a
distinguished member of the Sanhedrim who awaited the Kingdom of God and was for
that reason interested in the fate of Jesus, though we are not told that he was
his disciple — that this Joseph had the courage to beg permission from Pilate
to bury the remains of the crucified. Before granting it, Pilate sends for a
centurion and gets assurance that Jesus is really dead. This is to rule out the
theory that the body had been carried away, a question disputed between Jews and
Christians, neither of whom knew anything of what had really happened. The
permission granted, Joseph purchases a winding sheet, which must be a new one
for the Christ, wraps the body in it and lays it in a sepulchral cave, the
evangelist forgetting to tell us how the cave came to be at Joseph's disposal.
The tomb is said to have been hewn out of a rock, doubtless in reference to
prophecy (Isaiah xxii, 16; xxxiii, 16); the great stone closing the entrance is
to enhance the coming miracle. Finally the Galilean women, who have been brought
to Calvary for the purpose, take note of the exact spot in the cave where the
body has been laid. And all that takes place in the last minutes of &quot;the
preparation,&quot; that is, at the moment when Friday's sun is setting and the
Sabbath about to begin (xv, 42-47).

</p>
<p>In this way the story is given a form which makes Jesus
remain in the tomb for the entire length of the Sabbath day, plus the first
hours of the following night. As he will leave the tomb on Sunday morning, the
theft of the body could hardly be effected without violation of the Sabbath, of
which the disciples are supposed incapable. Moreover the chief advantage of the
arrangement is that it assigns the resurrection to the Day of the Sun, the
Lord's Day, the Day of the Risen Christ, chosen as necessarily the Day of
Resurrection. It is with this aim in view that the crucifixion is fixed on
Friday, the Sabbath offering all the advantages needed for the duration of the
period in the tomb, alike for apologetic, as we have just seen, and for
symbolism, the repose of the Sabbath day providing a fitting conception of the
kind of interval that death would cause in the existence of the Christ.
Nevertheless the time arrangement is somewhat mechanical, though this accords
with the materialized conception of the resurrection it is intended to serve. We
may add incidentally 

</p>
<p align="center">109

</p>
<p>that a relation exists between this ritual and symbolical
time-scheme and the arrangement of the fetes of Adonis, which comprised a first
day of feasting for the marriage of Adonis, followed by his death, then a day of
mourning and, on the third day, the mystical fete of the resurrection. This
relation cannot be fortuitous, since the text in Hosea (vi, 2-3) which was held
to announce the resurrection of Jesus, seems to contain an allusion to the fetes
of Adonis. [1]

</p>
<p>The Sabbath ended, three women, Mary of Magdala, Mary the
mother of James, and Salome, buy spices to embalm the dead body, and, Sunday
morning come, arrive at the tomb just after the sun has risen. We are to suppose
that Jesus had risen from the tomb as the sun rose, for the great stone is
rolled to one side, the tomb is empty and a man in white, that is an angel,
tells the women that Jesus the Nazarene [2] is risen and bids them inform the
disciples and Peter to go into Galilee, where they will find him, as he foretold
(xiv, 28; supra, p. 34). The frightened women then take to flight and &quot;say
nothing to any man.&quot;

</p>
<p>So ends the authentic text of the Gospel named after Mark.
The discovery of the empty tomb is held to be guaranteed by the experience of
these women whom fear has prevented from speaking of it. The Gospel editor, a
simple and well-intentioned man, says no more, the reason being that he is
conscious of stating a fact, a pretended fact, of which nobody has heard until
he here discloses it. Moreover lie knew well enough that, according to a
tradition from which he had not the least intention of departing, the disciples'
faith in the resurrection was formed in Galilee. And, further, he probably felt
himself incapable of relating the later manifestations of the risen Christ, or
thought he might abstain from doing so. We may well believe that his powers of
invention had already been exercised to a point which made him think it
advisable to call a halt. The silence he attributes to the women is to be
explained in the same way as are the injunctions to say nothing imposed on all
the anticipations of Jesus' Messiahship during his earthly career.

</p>
<p>The evangelist did not suspect that his story would soon be


</p>
<p>[1] Cf. Glotz, <i>Les fetes d'Adonis sous Ptolemee</i>, ii, in <i>Revue
des Etudes grecques</i>, xxxiii, 12, April-June, 1920.

more surely &quot;from Nazareth&quot;; cf. <i>supra</i>, p. 34.

</p>
<p align="center">110

</p>
<p>judged unsatisfactory. But, before that feeling arose,
other revisions of the Gospel catechesis had supplanted his in the usage of the
churches. The conclusion known as deuterocanonical, the addition of which was
deemed necessary, served simply to put his Gospel more or less in accord, for
the Christian reader, with the other forms of the catechesis. Some of our
exegetes discourse learnedly about the lost end of Mark — one of the problems
for which no solution can be found for the simple reason that they have no real
existence. We have already said a word (p. 69) about the approximate date of
Mark.</p>
