<P>
<center>&#167; 17. ACCOUNT GIVEN BY LUKE.* IMMEDIATE, SUPERNATURAL
CHARACTER OF THE REPRESENTATION.</center>
<P>
EACH of the four Evangelists represents the public ministry of
Jesus as preceded by that of John the Baptist; but it is peculiar
to Luke to make the Baptist the precursor of the Messiah in reference
also to the event of his birth. This account finds a legitimate
place in a work devoted exclusively to the consideration of the
life of Jesus: firstly, on account of the intimate connexion which
it exhibits as subsisting from the very commencement between the
life of John and the life of Jesus; and secondly, because it constitutes
a valuable contribution, aiding essentially towards the formation
of a correct estimate of the general character of the gospel narratives.
The opinion that the two first chapters of Luke, of which
this particular history forms a portion, are a subsequent and unauthentic
addition, is the uncritical assumption of a class of theologians
who felt that the history of the childhood of Jesus seemed to
require a mythical interpretation, but yet demurred to apply the
comparatively modern mythical view to the remainder of the
Gospel. &#134;
<P>
A pious sacerdotal pair had lived and grown old in the cherished,
but unrealized hope, of becoming parents, when, on a certain day,
<P>
* It may here be observed, once for all, that whenever in the following inquiry the
names "Matthew," "Luke," &c., are used, it is the author of the several Gospels who is
thus briefly indicated, quite irrespective of the question whether either of the Gospels was
written by an apostle or disciple of that name, or by a later unknown author.
<P>
&#134; See Kuinol Comm. in Luc., Proleg. p. 247.
<P>
<center>78</center>
<P>
as the priest is offering incense in the sanctuary, the angel Gabriel
appears to him, and promises him a son, who shall live consecrated
to God, and who shall be the harbinger of the Messiah, to prepare
his way when he shall visit and redeem his people. Zacharias, however,
is incredulous, and doubts the prediction on account of his own
advanced age and that of his wife; whereupon the angel, both as a
sign and as a punishment, strikes him dumb until the time of its
accomplishment; an infliction which endures until the day of the
circumcision of the actually born son, wlien the father, being called
upon to assign to the child the name predetermined by the angel,
suddenly recovers his speech, and with the regained powers of
utterance, breaks forth in a hymn of praise. (Luke i. 5-25. 57-80.)
<P>
It is evidently the object of this gospel account to represent a
series of external and miraculous occurrences.  The announcement
of the birth of the forerunner of the Messiah is divinely communicated
by the apparition of a celestial spirit; the conception takes
place under the particular and preternatural blessing ol God; and
the infliction and removal of dumbness are effected by extraordinary
means. But it is quite another question, whether we can accede to
the view of the author, or can feel convinced that the birth of the
Baptist was in fact preceded by such a series of miraculous events.
<P>
Tlie first offence against our modern notions in this narrative is
the appearance of the angel: the event contemplated in itself, as
well as the peculiar circumstances of the apparition. With respect
to the latter, the angel announces himself to be <i>Gabriel that stands
in the presence of God</i>. Now it is inconceivable that the constitution
of the celestial hierarchy should actually correspond with the
notions entertained by the Jews subsequent to the exile; and that
the names given to the angels should be in the language of this
people.* Here the supranaturalist finds himself in a dilemma, even
upon his own ground. Had the belief in celestial beings, occupying
a particular station in the court of heaven, and distinguished by
particular names, originated from the revealed religion of the Hebrews,&#151;had such a belief been established by Moses, or some later
prophet,&#151;then, according to the views of the supranaturalist, they
might, nay they must, be admitted to be correct. But it is in the
Maccabaean Daniel &#134; and in the apocryphal Tobit &#135; that this doctrine
of angels, in its more precise form, first appears; and it is evidently
a product of the influence of the Zend religion of the Persians on
the Jewish mind. We have the testimony of the Jews themselves,
that they brought the names of the angels with them from Babylon.&#167;

&#135; Here Raphael is represented as <i>one of the seven angels which go in and out before the glory of the holy One</i>; (Tobit, xii. 15.), almost the same as Gabriel in Luke i. 19., excepting the mention of the number.  This number is in imitation of the Persian Amschaspands. Vid. De Wette, bibl. Dogmatik, &#167; 171. b.

<P>
<center>79</center>
<P>
Hence arises a series of questions extremely perplexing to the supranaturalist.
Was the doctrine false so long as it continued to be
the exclusive possession of the heathens, but true as soon as it became
adopted by the Jews? or was it at all times equally true, and
was an important truth discovered by an idolatrous nation sooner
than by the people of God? If nations shut out from a particular
and divine revelation, arrived at truth by the light of reason alone,
sooner than the Jews who were guided by that revelation, then
either the revelation was superfluous, or its influence was merely
negative: that is, it operated as a check to the premature acquisition
of knowledge. If, in order to escape this consequence, it be
contended that truths were revealed by the divine influence to other
people besides the Israelites, the supranaturalistic point of view is
annihilated; and, since all things contained in religions which contradict
each other cannot have been revealed, we are compelled to
exercise a critical discrimination.   Thus, we find it to be by no
means in harmony with an elevated conception of God to represent
him as an earthly monarch, surrounded by his court: and when an
appeal is made, in behalf of the reality of angels standing round the
throne, to the reasonable belief in a graduated scale of created intelligences,*
the Jewish representation is not thereby justified, but
merely a modern conception substituted for it.  We should, thus,
be driven to the expedient of supposing an accommodation on the
part of God: that he sent a celestial spirit with the command to
simulate a rank and title which did not belong to him, in order that,
by this conformity to Jewish notions, he might insure the belief of
the father of the Baptist.  Since however it appears that Zacharias
did not believe the angel, but was first convinced by the result, the
accommodation proved fruitless, and consequently could not have
been a divine arrangement. With regard to the name of the angel,
and the improbability that a celestial being should bear a Hebrew
name, it has been remarked that the word Gabriel, taken
appellatively in the sense of <i>Man of God</i>, very appropriately designates
the nature of the heavenly visitant; and since it may be rendered
with this signification into every different language, the name cannot
be said to be restricted to the Hebrew. &#134; This explanation however
leaves the difficulty quite unsolved, since it converts into a
simple appellative a name evidently employed as a proper name.
In this case likewise an accommodation must be supposed, namely,
that the angel, in order to indicate his real nature, appropriated a
name which he did not actually bear: an accommodation already
judged in the foregoing remarks.
<P>
But it is not only the name and the alleged station of the angel
which shock our modern ideas, we also feel his discourse and his
conduct to be unworthy. Paulus indeed suggests that none but a
levitical priest, and not an angel of Jehovah, could have conceived it

<P>
necessary that the boy should live in nazarite abstemiousness,* but
to this it may be answered that the angel also might have known
that under this form John would obtain greater influence with the
people. But there is a more important difficulty. When Zacharias,
overcome by surprise, doubts the promise and asks for a sign, this
natural incredulity is regarded by the angel as a crime, and
immediately punished with dumbness. Though some may not coincide
with Paulus that a real angel would have lauded the spirit of inquiry
evinced by the priest, yet all will agree in the remark, that conduct
so imperious is less in character with a truly celestial being than
with the notions the Jews of that time entertained of such.
Moreover we do not find in the whole province of supranaturalism a
parallel severity.
<P>
The instance, cited by Paulus, of Jehovah's far milder treatment
of Abraham, who asks precisely the same question unreproved, Gen.
xv. 8, is refuted by Olshausen, because he considers the words of
Abraham, chap. v. 6, an evidence of his faith; but this observation
does not apply to chap. xviii. 12, where the greater incredulity of
Sarah, in a similar case, remains unpunished; nor to chap. xvii. 17,
where Abraham himself is not even blamed, though the divine
promise appears to him so incredible as to excite laughter. The
example of Mary is yet closer, who (Luke i. 34.) in regard to a still
greater improbability, but one which was similarly declared by a
special divine messenger to be no impossibility, puts exactly the
same question as Zacharias; so that we must agree with Paulus that
such inconsistency certainly cannot belong to the conduct of God or
of a celestical being, but merely to the Jewish representation of
them. Feeling the objectionableness of the representation in its
existing form, orthodox theologians have invented various motives to
justify this infliction of dumbness. Hess has attempted to screen
it from the reproach of an arbitrary procedure by regarding it as the
only means of keeping secret, even against the will of the priest, an
event, the premature proclamation of which might have been followed
by disastrous consequences, similar to those which attended
the announcement by the wise men of the birth of the child Jesus. &#134;
But, in the first place, the angel says nothing of such an object, he
inflicts the dumbness but as a sign and punishment; secondly, the
loss of speech did not hinder Zacharias from communicating, at any
rate to his wife, the main features of the apparition, since we see
that she was acquainted with the destined name of the cliild before
appeal was made to the father. Thirdly, what end did it serve thus
to render difficult the communication of the miraculous annunciation
of the unborn babe, since no sooner was it born than it was at once
exposed to all the dreaded dangers?&#151;for the father's sudden recovery
of speech, and the extraordinary scene at the circumcision
excited attention and became noised abroad in all the country. Ols-

<P>
hausen's view of the thing is more admissible. He regards the whole
proceeding, and especially the dumbness, as a moral training destined
to teach Zacharias to know and conquer his want of faith. *
But of this too we have no mention in the text; besides, the unexpected
accomplishment of the prediction would have made Zacharias
sufficiently ashamed of his unbelief, if instead of inflicting dumbness
the angel had merely remonstrated with him.
<P>
But however worthy of God we might grant the conduct of his
messenger to have been, still many of tlie present day will find an
angelic apparition, as such, incredible. Bauer insists that wherever
angels appear, both in the New Testament and in the Old, the
narrative is mythical. &#134; Even admitting the existence of angels, we
cannot suppose them capable of manifesting themselves to human
beings, since they belong to the invisible worldd, and spiritual existences
are not cognizable by the organs of sense; so that it is always
advisable to refer their pretended apparitions to the imagination. &#135;
It is not probable, it is added, that God should make use of them
according to the popular notion, for these apparitions have no apparent
adequate object, they serve generally only to gratify curiosity,
or to encourage man's disposition passively to leave his affairs in
higher hands. &#167; It is also remarkable that in the old world these
celestial beings show themselves active upon the smallest occasions,
whilst in modern times they remain idle even during the most
important occurrences. ||   But to deny their appearance and agency
among men is to call in question their very being, because it is precisely
this occupation which is a main object of their existence.
(Heb. i., 14.) According to Schleiermacher &#182; we cannot indeed actually
disprove the existence of angels, yet the conception is one which
could not have originated in our time, but belongs wholly to the
ancient ideas of the world.  The belief in angels has a twofold root
or source: the one the natural desire of the mind to presuppose a
larger amount of intelligence in the universe than is realized in the
human race. We who live in these days find this desire satisfied
in the conviction that other worlds exist besides our own, and are
peopled by intelligent beings; and thus the first source of the belief
in angels is destroyed.  The other source, namely, the representation
of God as an earthly monarch surrounded by his court, contradicts
all enlightened conceptions of Deity; and further, the phenomena
in the natural world and the transitions in human life, which
were formerly thought to be wrought by God himself through ministering
angels, we are now able to explain by natural causes; so that
the belief in angels is without a link by which it can attach itself to
rightly apprehended modern ideas; and it exists only as a lifeless
tradition.  The result is the same if, with one of the latest writers
on the doctrine of angels,* we consider as the origin of this repre-

sentation, man's desire to separate the two sides of his moral nature,
and to contemplate, as beings existing external to himself, angels
and devils. For, the origin of both representations remains merely
subjective, the angel being simply the ideal of created perfection:
which, as it was formed from the subordinate point of view of a
fanciful imagination, disappears from the higher and more comprehensive
observation of the intellect. *
<P>
Olshausen, on the other hand, seeks to deduce a positive argument
in favour of the reality of the apparation in question, from
those very reasonings of the present day which, in fact, negative
the existence of angels; and he does so by viewing the subject on
its speculative side. He is of opinion that the gospel narrative does
not contradict just views of the world, since God is immanent in
the universe and moves it by his breath. &#134; But if it be true that
God is immanent in the world, precisely on that account is the intervention
of angels superfluous. It is only a Deity who dwells
apart, throned in heaven, who requires to send down his angels to
fulfil his purposes on earth. It would excite surprise to find Olshausen
arguing thus, did we not perceive from the manner in which
this interpreter constantly treats of angelology and demonology, that
he does not consider angels to be independent personal entities; but
regards them rather as divine powers, transitory emanations and
fulgurations of the Divine Being. Thus Olshausen's conception of
angels, in their relation to God, seems to correspond with the Sabellian
doctrine of the Trinity; but as his is not the representation
of the Bible, as also the arguments in favour of the former prove nothing
in relation to the latter, it is useless to enter into further explanation.
The reasoning of this same theologian, that we must
not require the ordinariness of every day life for the most pregnant
epochs in the life of the human race; that the incarnation of the
eternal word was accompanied by extraordinary manifestations from
the world of spirits, uncalled for in times less rich in momentous
results, &#135; rests upon a misapprehension. For the ordinary course of
every day life is interrupted in such moments, by the very fact that
exalted beings like the Baptist are born into the world, and it would
be puerile to designate as ordinary those times and circumstances
which gave birth and maturity to a John, because they were unembellished
by angelic apparitions. That which the spiritual world
does for ours at such periods is to send extraordinary human intelligences,
not to cause angels, to ascend and descend.
<P>
Finally, if, in vindication of this narrative, it be stated that such
an exhibition by the angel, of the plan of education for the unborn
child, was necessary in order to make him the man who should become, &#167; the assumption includes too much; namely, that all great
men, in order by their education to become such, must have been
introduced into the world in like manner, or cause must be shown

<P>
why that which was unnecessary in the case of great men of other
ages and countries was indispensable for the Baptist. Again, the
assumption attaches too much importance to external training, too
little to the internal development of the mind. But in conclusion,
many of the circumstances in the life of the Baptist, instead of
serving to confirm a belief in the truth of the miraculous history,
are on the contrary, as has been justly maintained, altogether irreconcileable
with the supposition, that his birth was attended by
these wonderful occurrences. If it were indeed true, that John was
from the first distinctly and miraculously announced as the forerunner
of the Messiah, it is inconceivable that he should have had
no acquaintance with Jesus prior to his baptism; and that, even
subsequent to that event, he should have felt perplexed concerning
his Messiahship. (John i., 30 ; Matth. xi., 2.*)
<P>
Consequently the <i>negative</i> conclusion of the rationalistic criticism
and controversy must, we think, be admitted, namely, that
tho birth of the Baptist could not have been preceded and attended
by these supernatural occurrences.  The question now arises, what
<i>positive</i> view of the matter is to replace the rejected literal orthodox
explanation?
<P>
<center>&#167; 18. NATURAL EXPLANATION OF THE NARRATIVE.</center>
<P>
IN treating tlie narrative before us according to the rationalistic
method, which requires the separation of the pure fact from the
opinion of interested persons, the simplest alteration is this: to retain
the two leading facts, the apparition and the dumbness, as
actual external occurrences; but to account for them in a natural
manner. This were possible with respect to the apparition, by supposing
that a man, mistaken by Zacharias for a divine messenger,
really appeared to him, and addressed to him the words he believed
he heard.   But this explanation viewed in connexion with the
attendant circumstances, being too improbable, it became necessary
to go a step further, and to transform the event from an external
to an internal one ; to remove the occurrence out of the physical
into the psychological world.  To this view the opinion of Bahrdt,
that a flash ot lightning was perhaps mistaken by Zacharias for an
angel, &#134; forms a transition; since he attributes the greater part of
the scene to Zacharias's imagination. But that any man, in an
ordinary state of mind, could have created so long and consecutive
a dialogue out of a flash of lightning is incredible. A peculiar mental
state must be supposed; whether it be a swoon, the effect of
fright occasioned by the lightning, &#135; but of this there is no trace in
the tcxt; (no falling down as in Acts ix., 4.); or, abandoning tho
notion of the lightning, a dream, which, however, could scarcely

occur whilst burning incense in the temple. Hence, it has been
found necessary, with Paulus, to call to mind that there are waking
visions or ecstasies, in which the imagination confounds internal
images with external occurrences. * Such ecstasies, it is true, are
not common; but says Paulus, in Zacharias's case many circumstances
combined to produce so unusual a state of mind. The exciting
causes were, firstly, the long-cherished desire to have a
posterity; secondly, the exalted vocation of administering in the
Holy Place, offering up with the incense the prayers of the people
to the throne of Jehovah, which seemed to Zacharias to foretoken
the acceptance of his own prayer; and thirdly, perhaps an exhortation
from his wife as he left his house, similar to that of Rachel to
Jacob. Gen. xxx., I. (!) In this highly excited state of mind, as he
prays in the dimly-lighted sanctuary, he thinks of his most ardent
wish, and expecting that now or never his prayer shall be heard,
he is prepared to discern a sign of its acceptance in the slightest
occurrence. As the glimmer of the lamps falls upon the ascending
cloud of incense, and shapes it into varying forms, the priest imagines
he perceives the figure of an angel. The apparition at first
alarms him; but he soon regards it as an assurance from God that
his prayer is heard. No sooner does a transient doubt cross his
mind, than the sensitively pious priest looks upon himself as sinful,
believes himself reproved by tlie angel, and&#151;here two explanations
are possible&#151;either an apoplectic seizure actually deprives him of
speech, which he receives as the just punishment of his incredulity,
till the excessive joy he experiences at the circumcision of his son
restores the power of utterance: so that the dumbness is retained
as an external, physical, though not miraculous, occurrence; &#134; or the
proceeding is psychologically understood, namely, that Zacharias,
in accordance with a Jewish superstition, for a time denied himself
the use of the offending member. &#135; Re-animated in other respects
by the extraordinary event, the priest returns home to his wife, and
she becomes a second Sarah.
<P>
With regard to this account of the angelic apparition given by
Paulus,&#151;and the other explanations are either of essentially similar
character, or are so manifestly untenable, as not to need refutation&#151;it
may be observed that the object so laboriously striven after is not
attained. Paulus fails to free the narrative of the marvellous; for
by his own admission, the majority of men have no experience of
the kind of vision here supposcd. &#167; If such a state of ecstasy occur
in particular cases, it must result either from a predisposition in the
individual, of which we find no sign in Zacharias, and which his
advanced age must have rendered highly improbable; or it must
have been induced by some peculiar circumstances, which totally
fail in the present instance. || A hope which has been long indulged

is inadequate to the production of ecstatic vehemence, and the act
of burning incense is insufficient to cause so extraordinary an excitement,
in a priest who has grown old in the service of the temple.
Thus Paulus has in fact substituted a miracle of chance for a miracle
of God.  Should it be said that to God nothing is impossible,
or to chance nothing is impossible, both explanations are equally
precarious and unscientific.
<P>
Indeed, the dumbness of Zacharias as explained from this point
of view is very unsatisfactory. For had it been, as according to
one explanation, the result of apoplexy; admitting Paulus's reference
to Lev. xxi., 16, to be set aside by the contrary remark of
Lightfoot, * still, we must join with Schleiermacher in wondering
how Zacharias, notwithstanding this apoplectic seizure, returned
home in other respects healthy and vigorous; &@134; and that in spite of
partial paralysis his general strength was unimpaired, and his long-cherished
hope fulfilled. It must also be regarded as a strange
coincidence, that the father's tongue should have been loosed exactly
at the time of the circumcision; for if the recovery of speech
is to be considered as the effect of joy, &#135; surely the father must have
been far more elated at the birth of the earnestly-desired son, than
at the circumcision; for by that time he would have become accustomed
to the possession of his child.
<P>
The other explanation: that Zacharias's silence was not from
any physical impediment, but from a notion, to be psychologically
explained, that he ought not to speak, is in direct contradiction to
the words of Luke. What do all the passages, collected by Paulus
to show that <font face="Symbol">ou dunamai</font> may signify not only a positive <i>non posse</i>,
but likewise a mere <i>non sustinere</i>, &#167; prove against the clear meaning
of the passage and its context? If perhaps the narrative phrase,
(v. 22.) <font face="Symbol">ouk hdunato lalesai autoiV</font> might be forced to bear this
sense, yet certainly in the supposed vision of Zacharias, had the
angel only forbidden him to speak, instead of depriving him of the
power of speech, he would not have said: 
<font face="Symbol">kai esh siwpwn, mh dunamenoV lalhsai</font>, but <font face="Symbol">isqi siwpwn mhd' epiceirhshV lalhsai</font>. The words <font face="Symbol">diemene kofoV</font> (v. 21.) also most naturally mean actual dumbness. This
view assumes, and indeed necessarily so, that the gospel history is
a correct report of the account given by Zacharias himself; if then
it be denied that the dumbness was actual, as Zacharias affirms
that actual dumbness was announced to him by the angel, it must
be admitted that, though perfectly able to speak, he believed himself
to be dumb; which leads to the conclusion that he was mad:
an imputation not to be laid upon the father of the Baptist without
compulsory evidence in the text.
<P>
Again, the natural explanation makes too light of the incredibly
accurate fulfilment of a prediction originating, as it supposes, in an

<P>
unnatural, over-excited state of mind. In no other province of inquiry
would the realization of a prediction which owed its birth to
a vision be found credible, even by the Rationalist. If Dr. Paulus
were to read that a somnambulist, in a state of ecstasy, had foretold
the birth of a child, under circumstances in the highest degree
improbable; and not only of a child, but of a boy; and had moreover,
with accurate minuteness, predicted his future mode of life,
character, and position in history; and that each particular had
been exactly verified by the result: would he find such a coincidence credible?
Most assuredly to no human being, under any conditions whatsoever, would he concede the power thus to penetrate
the most mysterious workings of nature; on the contrary he would
complain of the outrage on human free-will, which is annihilated
by the admission that a man's entire intellectual and moral development may be predetermined like the movements of a clock. And
he would on this very ground complain of the inaccuracy of observation, and untrustworthiness of the report, which represented, as
matters of fact, things in their very nature impossible. Why does
he not follow the same rule with respect to the New Testament
narrative? Why admit in the one case what he rejects in the other?
Is biblical history to be judged by one set of laws, and profane history by another?&#151;An assumption which the Rationalist is compelled to make, if he admits as credible in the Gospels that which
he rejects as unworthy of credit in every other history&#151;which is in
fact to fall back on the supranaturalistic point of view, since the
assumption, that the natural laws which govern in every other province
are not applicable to sacred history, is the very essential of
supranaturalism.
<P>
No other rescue from this self annihilation remains to the antisupernatural mode of explanation, than to question the verbal accuracy of the history. This is the simplest expedient, felt to be such
by Paulus himself, who remarks, that his efforts may be deemed
superfluous to give a natural explanation of a narrative, which is
nothing more than one of those stories invented either after the
death or even during the lifetime of every distinguished man to embellish his early history. Paulus, however, after an impartial examination, is of opinion that the analogy, in the present instance,
is not applicable. The principal ground for this opinion is the too
short interval between the birth of the Baptist, and the composition
of the Gospel of Luke.* We, on the contrary, in harmony with
the observations in the introduction, would reverse the question and
inquire of the interpreter, how he would render it credible, that the
history of the birth of a man so famed as the Baptist should have
been transmitted, in an age of great excitement, through a period
of more than sixty years, in all its primitive accuracy of detail?
Paulus's answer is ready: an answer approved by others (Heidenreich, Olshausen):&#151;the passage inserted by Luke (i. 5; ii. 39.)
<P>
<center>87</center>
<P>
was possibly a family record, which circulated among the relatives
of the Baptist and of Jesus; and of which Zacharias was probably
the author.*
<P>
K. Ch. L. Schmidt controverts this hypothesis with the remark,
that it is impossible that a narrative so disfigured, (we should rather
say, so embellished,) could have been a family record; and that, if
it does not belong altogether to the class of legends, its historical
basis, if such there be, is no longer to be distinguished. &#134; It is
further maintained, that the narrative presents certain features which
no poet would have conceived, and which prove it to be a direct impression
of facts; for instance, the Messianic expectations expressed
by the different personages introduced by Luke (chap. i. and ii.)
correspond exactly with the situation and relation of each
individual. &#135; But these distinctions are by no means so striking as
Paulus represents; they are only the characteristics of a history
which goes into details, making a transition from generalities to
particulars, which is natural alike to the poet and to the popular
legend; besides, the peculiar Judaical phraseology in which the
Messianic expectations are expressed, and which it is contended
confirm the opinion that this narrative was written, or received its
fixed form, before the death of Jesus, continued to be used after
that event. (Acts i. 6.&#167;) Moreover we must agree with Schleiermacher
when he says: || least of all is it possible to regard these
utterances as strictly historical; or to maintain that Zacharias, in
the moment that he recovered his speech, employed it in a song of
praise, uninterrupted by the exultation and wonder of the company,
sentiments which the narrator interrupts himself to indulge.   It
must, at all events, be admitted, that the author has made additions
of his own, and has enriched the history by the lyric effusions
of his muse. Kuinol supposes that Zacharias composed and wrote
down the canticle subsequent to the occasion; but this strange surmise
contradicts the text. There are some other features which,
it is contended, belong not to the creations of the poet; such as,
the signs made to the father, the debate in the family, the position
of the angel on the right hand of the altar.  But this criticism is
merely a proof that these interpreters have, or determine to have,
no just conception of poetry or popular legend; for the genuine
characteristic of poetry and mythus is natural and pictorial representation
of details.**

has led many theologians to explain the account of the birth of the
Baptist as a poetical composition; suggested, by the importance attributed
by the Christians to the forerunner of Jesus, and by the
recollection of some of the Old Testament histories, in which the
births of Ishmael, Isaac, Samuel, and especially of Samson, are
related to have been similarly announced. Still the matter was not
allowed to be altogether invented. It may have been historically
true that Zacharias and Elizabeth lived long without offspring; that,
on one occasion whilst in the temple, the old man's tongue was
suddenly paralyzed; but that soon afterwards his aged wife bore
him a son, and he, in his joy at the event, recovered the power of
speech. At that time, but still more when John became a remarkable
man, the history excited attention, and out of it the existing
legend grew. *
<P>
It is surprising to find an explanation almost identical with the
natural one we have criticised above, again brought forward under
a new title; so that the admission of the possibility of an admixture
of subsequent legends in the narrative has little influence on the
view of the matter itself. As the mode of explanation we are now
advocating denies all confidence in the historical authenticity of the
record, all the details must be in themselves equally problematic;
and whether historical validity can be retained for this or that particular
incident, can be determined only by its being either less
improbable than the rest, or else less in harmony with the spirit,
interest, and design of the poetic legend, so as to make it probable
that it had a distinct origin. The barenness of Elizabeth and the
sudden dumbness of Zacharias are here retained as incidents of this
character: so that only the appearing and prediction of the angel
are given up. But by taking away the angelic apparition, the sudden
infliction and as sudden removal of the dumbness loses its only
adequate supernatural cause, so that all difficulties which beset the
natural interpretation remain in full force: a dilemma into which
these theologians are, most unnecessarily, brought by their own
inconsequence; for the moment we enter upon mythical ground, all
obligation to hold fast the assumed historical fidelity of the account
ceases to exist. Besides, that which they propose to retain as historical
fact, namely, the long barenness of the parents of the Baptist,
is so strictly in harmony with the spirit and character of Hebrew
legendary poetry, that of this incident the mythical origin is least
to be mistaken. How confused has this misapprehension made,
for example, the reasoning of Bauer! It was a prevailing opinion,
says he, consonant with Jewish ideas, that all children born of aged
parents who had previously been childless became distinguished personages.
John was the child of aged parents, and became a notable
preacher of repentance; consequently it was thought justifiable to
infer that his birth was predicted by an angel. What an illogical

<P>
conclusion! for which he has no other ground than the assumption
that Jolm was the son of aged parents. Let this be made a settled
point, and the conclusion follows without difficulty. It was readily
believed, he proceeds, of remarkable men that they were born of
aged parents and that their birth, no longer in the ordinary course
of nature to be expected, was announced by a heavenly messenger; *
John was a great man and a prophet; consequently, the legend represented
him to have been born of an aged couple, and his birth
to have been proclaimed by an angel.
<P>
Seeing that this explanation of the narrative before us, as a half
(so called historical) mythus, is encumbered with all the difficulties
of a half measure, Gabler has treated it as a pure philosophical, or
dogmatical mythus. &#134; Horst likewise considers it, and indeed the
entire two first chapters of Luke of which it forms a part, as an ingenious
fiction, in which the birth of the Messiah, together with
that of his precursor, and the predictions concerning the character
and ministry of the latter, framed after the event, are set forth; it
being precisely the loquacious circumstantiality of the narration
which betrays the poet. &#135; Schleiermacher likewise explains the first
chapter as a little poem, similar in character to many of the Jewish
poems wliich we meet with in their apocrypha. He does not however
consider it altogether a fabrication. It might have had a foundation
in fact, and in a wide spread tradition; but the poet has allowed
himself so full a license in arranging, and combining, in
moulding and embodying the vague and fluctuating representations
of tradition, that the attempt to detect the purely historical in such
narratives, must prove a fruitless and useless effort. &#167; Horst goes so
far as to suppose the author of the piece to have been a Judaising
Christian; whilst Schleiermacher imagines it to have been composed
by a Christian of the famed Jewish school, at a period when it comprised
some who still continued strict disciples of John; and whom
it was the object of the narrative to bring over to Christianity, by exhibiting
the relationship of John to the Christ as his peculiar and highest
destiny; and also by holding out the expectation of a state of temporal
greatness for the Jewish people at the re-appearance of Christ.

which, as most interpreters admit, the narrative of the annunciation

abundantly evident that this is the only just view of the passage in
question. But it must not here be imagined, as is now so readily
affirmed in the confutation of the mythical view of this passage, that
the author of our narrative first made a collection from the Old
Testament of its individual traits; much rather had the scattered
traits respecting the late birth of different distinguished men, as recorded
in the Old Testament, blended themselves into a compound
image in the mind of their reader, whence he selected the features
most appropriate to his present subject. Of the children born of
aged parents Isaac is the most ancient prototype. As it is said of
Zacharias and Elizabeth "they both were advanced in their days"
(v. 7.) <font face="Symbol">probebhkoteV en taiV hmeraiV autwn</font>, so Abraham and Sarah
"were advanced in their days" [Hebrew letters] (Gen. xviii; LXX:
<font face="Symbol">probebhkoteV hmerwn</font>), when they were promised a son. It is likewise from this history that the incredulity of the father, on account
of the advanced age of both parents, and the demand of a sign, are
borrowed in our narrative. As Abraham, when Jehovah promises
him he shall have a son and a numerous posterity who shall inherit
the land of Canaan, doubtingly inquires "Whereby shall I know
that I shall inherit it?" <font face="Symbol">kata ti gnwsomai, oti plhronomhsw authn</font>; (sc. <font face="Symbol">thn ghn</font>. Gen xv. 8. LXX): so Zacharias&#151;"Whereby shall
I know tills?" <font face="Symbol">kata ti gnwsomai tato</font>; (v. 18.) The incredulity of
Sarah is not made use of for Elizabeth; but she is said to be of the
daughters of Aaron, and the name Elizabeth may perhaps have been
suggested by that of Aaron's wife. (Exod. vi. 23. LXX.) The incident
of the angel announcing the birth of the Baptist is taken from
the history of another late-born child, Samson. In our narrative
indeed, the angel appears first to the father in the temple, whereas
in the history of Samson he shows himself first to the mother, and
afterwards to the father in the field. This, however, is an alteration
arising naturally out of the different situations of the respective parents.
(Judges xiii.) According to popular Jewish notions it was
no unusual occurrence for the priest to be visited by angels and divine
apparitions whilst offering incense in the temple.* The command
which before his birth predestined the Baptist&#151;whose later
ascetic mode of life was known&#151;to be a Nazarite, is taken from the
same source. As, to Samson's mother during her pregnancy, wine,
strong drink, and unclean food, were forbidden, so a similar diet is
prescribed for her son, adding, as in the case of John, that the
child shall be consecrated to God from the womb.  The blessings

<center>91</center>
which it is predicted that these two men shall realize for the people
of Israel are similar, (comp. Luke i. 16, 17, with Judges xiii. 5.)
and each narrative concludes with the same expression respecting
the hopeful growth of tlie child. It may be too bold to derive the
Levitical descent of the Baptist from a third Old Testament history
of a late-born son&#151;from the history of Samuel; (compare 1 Sam.
i. 1; Chron. vii. 27.) but the lyric effusions in the first chapter of
Luke are imitations of this history. As Samuel's mother, when
consigning him to the care of the high priests, breaks forth into a
hymn, (1 Sam. ii. 1.) so the father of Jolin does the same at the
circumcision; though the particular expressions in the Canticle uttered
by Mary&#151;of which we shall have to speak hereafter&#151;have a
closer resemblance to Hannah's song of praise than that of Zacharias.
The significant appellation <i>John</i> (<font face="Symbol">qeocariV</font>) predetermined by the angel, had its precedent in the announcements of
the names of Ishmael and Isaac; but the ground of its selection
was the apparently providential coincidence between the signification
of the name and the historical destination of the man. The
remark, that the name of John was not in the family, (v. 61.) only
brought its celestial origin more fully into view. The tablet (<font face="Symbol">pinakidion</font> upon which the father wrote the name (v. 63.) was necessary
on account of his incapacity to speak ; but it also had its type in the
Old Testament.   Isaiah was commanded to write the significant
names of the child Maher-shalal-hash-baz upon a tablet. (Isaiah
viii. 1, ff.) The only supernatural incident of the narrative, of which
the Old Testament may seem to offer no precise analogy, is the
dumbness; and this is the point fixed upon by those who contest
the mythical view. But if it be borne in mind that the asking and
receiving a sign from heaven in confirmation of a promise or prophecy
was usual among the Hebrews (comp. Isaiah vli. 11, ff.); that
the temporary loss of one of the senses was the peculiar punishment
inflicted after a heavenly vision (Acts ix. 8, 17, ff.); that Daniel
became dumb whilst the angel was talking with him, and did not
recover his speech till the angel had touched his lips and opened his
mouth: (Dan. x. 15, f.) the origin of this incident also will be found
in the legend and not in historical fact. Of two ordinary and subordinate
features of the narrative, the one, the righteousness of the
parents of the Baptist, (v. 6.) is merely a conclusion founded upon
the belief that to a pious couple alone would the blessing of such a
son be vouchsafed, and consequently is void of all historical worth;
<P>
<center>92</center>
<P>
the other, the statement that John was bom in the reign of Herod
(the Great) (v. 5.) is without doubt a correct calculation.
<P>
So that we stand here upon purely mythical-poetical ground;
the only historical reality which we can hold fast as positive matter
of fact being this:&#151;the impression made by John the Baptist, by
virtue of his ministry and his relation to Jesus, was so powerful as
to lead to the subsequent glorification of his birth in connection with
the birth of the Messiah in the Christian legend.*
