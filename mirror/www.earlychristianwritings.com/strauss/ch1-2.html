<P><FONT size=+1>DAVIDICAL DESCENT OF JESUS, ACCORDING TO THE GENEALOGICAL 
TABLES OF MATTHEW AND LUKE.</FONT> 
<P>
<HR width="10%">

<P>
<CENTER>§§ 20.THE TWO GENEALOGIES OF JESUS CONSIDERED SEPARATELY AND 
IRRESPECTIVELY OF ONE ANOTHER.</CENTER>
<P>IN the history of the birth of the Baptist, we had the single account of 
Luke; but regarding the genealogical descent of Jesus we have also that of 
Matthew; so that in this case the mutual control of two narrators in some 
respects multiplies, whilst in others it lightens, our critical labour. It is 
indeed true that the authenticity of the two first chapters of Matthew, which 
contain the history of the birth and childhood of Jesus, as well as that of the 
parallel section of Luke, has been questioned: but as in both cases the question 
has originated merely in a prejudiced view of the subject, the doubt has been 
silenced by a decisive refutation.†
<P>Each of these two gospels contains a genealogical table designed to exhibit 
the Davidical descent of Jesus, the Messiah. That of Matthew (i. 1-17.) 
precedes, that of Luke (iii. 23-38.) follows, the history of the announcement 
and birth of Jesus. These two tables, considered each in itself, or both 
compared together, afford so important a key to the character of the evangelic 
records in this section, as to render a close examination of them imperative. We 
shall first consider each separately, and then each, but particularly that of 
Matthew, in comparison with the passages in the Old Testament to which it is 
parallel. 
<P>In the Genealogy given by the author of the first Gospel, there is a 
comparison of the account with itself which is important, as it gives a result, 
a sum at its conclusion, whose correctness may be proved by comparing it with 
the previous statements. In the sum-

<P>[??]*With this view of the passage compare Pe Wette, Exeg. Handbuch zum N. 
T.,

<CENTER>93</CENTER>
<P>ming up it is said, that from Abraham to Christ there are three divisions of 
fourteen generations each, the first from Abraham to David, the second from 
David to the Babylonish exile, the third from the exile to Christ. Now if we 
compute the number of names for ourselves, we find the first fourteen from 
Abraham to David, both included, complete (2-5); also that from Solomon to 
Jechonias, after whom the Babylonish exile is mentioned (6-11); but from 
Jechonias to Jesus, even reckoning the latter as one, we can discover only 
thirteen (12-16). How shall we explain this discrepancy? The supposition that 
one of the names has escaped from the third division by an error of a 
transcriber*, is in the highest degree improbable, since the deficiency is 
mentioned so early as by Porphyry.† The insertion, in some manuscripts and 
versions, of the name <I>Jehoiakim</I>‡ between Josias and Jechonias, does not 
sup- ply the deficiency of the third division; it only adds a superfluous 
generation to the second division, which was already complete. As also there is 
no doubt that this deficiency originated with the author of the genealogy, the 
question arises : in what manner did he reckon so as to count fourteen 
generations for his third series? Truly it is possible to count in various ways, 
if an arbitrary inclusion and exclusion of the first and last members of the 
several series be permitted. It might indeed have been presupposed, that a 
generation already included in one division was necessarily excluded from 
another: but the compiler of the genealogy may perhaps have thought otherwise; 
and since David is twice mentioned in the table, it is possible that the author 
counted him twice: namely, at the end of the first series, and again at the 
beginning of the . second. This would not indeed, any more than the insertion of 
Jehoiakim, fill up the deficiency in the third division, but give too many to 
the second; so that we must, with some commentators§, conclude the second series 
not with Jechonias, as is usually done, but with his predecessor Josias: and 
now, by means of the double enumeration of David, Jechonias, who was superfluous 
in the second division, being available for the third, the last series, 
including Jesus, has its fourteen members complete. But it seems very arbitrary 
to reckon the concluding member of the first series twice, and not also that of 
the second: to avoid which inconsistency some interpreters have proposed to 
count Josias twice, as well as David, and thus complete the fourteen members of 
the third series without Jesus. But whilst this computation escapes one blunder 
it falls into another ; namely, that whereas the expression &gt;GREEK FOR 
PETER&lt; is supposed to include the latter, in &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;, the 
latter is excluded. This difficulty may be avoided by counting Jechonias twice 
instead of Josias, which gives us fourteen names for the third division, 
including Jesus; but then, in order not to have too many in the second, we must 
drop
<P>* Paulas, p. 292, 
<P>† Hieron, in Daniel, init.
<P>‡ See Wetstein. § e. g. Frische, Comm. in Matth., p. 13. 
<P>
<CENTER>94</CENTER>
<P>the double enumeration of David, and thus be liable to the same charge of 
inconsistency as in the former case, since the double enumeration is made 
between the second and third divisions, and not between the first and second. 
Perhaps De Wette has found the right clue when he remarks, that in v. 17, in 
both transitions some member of the series is mentioned twice, but in the first 
case only that member is a <I>person</I> (David), and therefore to be twice 
reckoned. In the second case it is the <I>Babylonish captivity</I> occurring 
between Josias and Jechonias, which latter, since he had reigned only three 
months in Jerusalem (the greater part of his life having passed after the 
carrying away to Babylon), was mentioned indeed at the conclusion of the second 
series for the sake of connexion, but was to be reckoned only at the beginning 
of the third.*
<P>If we now compare the genealogy of Matthew (still without reference to that 
of Luke) with the corresponding passages of the Old Testament, we shall also 
find discrepancy, and in this case of a nature exactly the reverse of the 
preceding : for as the table considered in itself required the duplication of 
one member in order to complete its scheme, so when compared with the Old 
Testament, we find that many of the names there recorded have been omitted, in 
order that the number fourteen might not be exceeded. That is to say, the Old 
Testament affords data for comparison with this genealogical table as the famed 
pedigree of the royal race of David, from Abraham to Zorobabel and his sons; 
after whom the Davidical line begins to retire into obscurity, and from the 
silence of the Old Testament the genealogy of Matthew ceases to be under any 
control. The series of generations from Abraham to Judah, Pharez, and Hezron, is 
sufficiently well known from Genesis; from Pharez to David we find it in the 
conclusion of the book of Ruth, and in the 2nd chapter of the 1st Chronicles ; 
that from David to Zerubbabel in the 3rd chapter of the same book ; besides 
passages that are parallel with separate portions of the series. 
<P>To complete the comparison: we find the line from Abraham to David, that is, 
the whole first division of fourteen in our genealogy, in exact accordance with 
the names of men given in the Old Testament : leaving out however the names of 
some women, one of which makes a difficulty. It is said v. 5 that Rahab was the 
mother of Boaz. Not only is this without confirmation in the Old Testament, but 
even if she be made the great-grandmother of Jesse, the father of David, there 
are too few generations between her time and that of David (from about 1450 to 
1050 B.C.), that is, counting either Rahab or David as one, four for 400 years. 
Yet this error falls back upon the Old Testament genealogy itself, in so far as 
Jesse's great-grandfather Salmon, whom Matthew calls the husband of Rahab, is 
said Ruth iv. 20, as well as by Matthew, to be the son of a Nahshon, who 
according to Numbers i. 7, lived in the time of the
<P>* Exegt. Handbuch, i. 1, S. 12 f.
<P>
<CENTER>95</CENTER>
<P>march through the wilderness*: from which circumstance the idea was naturally 
suggested, to marry his son with that Rahab who saved the Israelitish spies, and 
thus to introduce a woman for whom the Israelites had an especial regard 
(compare James ii. 25, Heb. xi. 31) into the lineage of David and the Messiah. 
<P>Many discrepancies are found in the second division from David to Zorababel 
and his son, as well as in the beginning of the third. Firstly, it is said v. 8 
<I>Joram begat Osias ;</I> whereas we know from 1 Chron. iii. 11, 12, that 
Uzziah was not the son, but the grandson of the son of Joram, and that three 
kings occur between them, namely, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, after whom comes 
Uzziah, (2 Chron. xxvi. 1, or as he is called 1 Chron. iii. 12, and 2 Kings xiv. 
21, Azariah). Secondly: our genealogy says v. 11, <I>Josias begat Jechonias and 
his brethren</I>. But we find from 1 Chron. iii. 16, that the son and successor 
of Josiah was called Jehoiakim, after whom came his son and successor Jechoniah 
or Jehoiachin. Moreover <I>brethren</I> are ascribed to Jechoniah, whereas the 
Old Testament mentions none. Jehoiakim, however, had brothers : so that the 
mention of the <I>brethren of Jechonias</I> in Matthew appears to have 
originated in an exchange of these two persons.-A third discrepancy relates to 
Zorobabel. He is here called, v. 12, a son of Salathiel; whilst in 1 Chron. iii. 
19, he is descended from Jechoniah, not through Shealtiel, but through his 
brother Pedaiah. In Ezra v. 2, and Haggai i. 1, however, Zerubbabel is 
designated, as here, the son of Sheatiel.-In the last place, Abiud, who is here 
called the son of Zorobabel, is not to be found amongst the children of 
Zerubbabel mentioned 1 Chron. iii. 19 f.: perhaps because Abiud was only a 
surname derived from a son of one of those there men- tioned.†
<P>The second and third of these discrepancies may have crept in without evil 
intention, and without any great degree of carelessness, for the omission of 
Jehoiakim may have arisen from the similar sound of the names &gt;HEBREW&lt; and 
which accounts also for the transposition of the brothers of Jechoniah; whilst 
respecting Zorobabel the reference to the Old Testament is partly adverse, 
partly favourable. But the first discrepancy we have adduced, namely, the 
omission of three known kings, is not so easily to be set aside. It has indeed 
been held that the similarity of names may here also have led the author to pass 
unintentionally from Joram to Ozias, instead of to the similar sounding Ahaziah, 
(in the LXX. Ocliozias). But this omission falls in so happily with the author's 
design of the threefold fourteen, (admitting the double enumeration of David), 
that we cannot avoid believing, with Jerome, that the oversight was made on 
purpose with a view to it.‡ From
<P>* The expedient of Kuinöl, Comm, in Matth. p. 3, to distinguish the Rahab 
here mentioned from the celebrated one, becomes hence superfluous, besides that 
it is perfectly arbitrary.

<P>Abraham to David, where the first division presented itself, having found 
fourteen members, he seems to have wished that those of the following divisions 
should correspond in number. In the whole remaining series the Babylonish exile 
offered itself as the natural point of separation. But as the second division 
from David to the exile gave him four supernumerary members, therefore he 
omitted four of the names. For what reason these particular four were chosen 
would be difficult to determine, at least for the three last mentioned. 
<P>The cause of the compiler's laying so much stress on the threefold equal 
numbers, may have been simply, that by this adoption of the Oriental custom of 
division into equal sections, the genealogy might be more easily committed to 
memory*: but with this motive a mystical idea was probably combined. The 
question arises whether this is to be sought in the number which is thrice 
repeated, or whether it consists in the threefold repetition? Fourteen is the 
double of the sacred number seven; but it is improbable that it was selected for 
this reason,† because otherwise the seven would scarcely have been so completely 
lost sight of in the fourteen. Still more improbable is the conjecture of 
Olshausen, that the number fourteen was specially chosen as being the numeric 
value of the name of David‡; for puerilities of this kind, appropriate to the 
rabbinical gematria, are to be found in no other part of the Gospels. It is more 
likely that the object of the genealogists consisted merely in the repetition of 
an equal number by retaining the fourteen which had first accidentally presented 
itself: since it was a notion of the Jews that signal divine visitations, 
whether of prosperity or adversity, recurred at regular periodical intervals. 
Thus, as fourteen generations had intervened between Abraham, the founder of the 
holy people, and David the king after God's own heart, so fourteen generations 
must intervene between the re-establishment of the kingdom and the coming of the 
son of David, the Messiah.§ The most ancient genealogies in Genesis exhibit the 
very same uniformity. As according to the &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;, cap. v., from 
Adam * the first, to Noah the second, father of men, were ten generations: so 
from Noah, or rather from his son, the tenth is Abraham the father of the 
faithful.||
<P>This <I>à priori</I> treatment of his subject, this Procrustes-bed upon which 
the author of our genealogy now stretches, now curtails it, almost like a 
philosopher constructing a system,-can excite no predisposition in his favour. 
It is in vain to appeal to the custom

<P>
<CENTER>97</CENTER>
<P>of Oriental genealogists to indulge themselves in similar license; for when 
an author presents us with a pedigree expressly declaring that <I>all the 
generations</I> during a space of time were fourteen, whereas, through accident 
or intention, many members are wanting,-he betrays an arbitrariness and want of 
critical accuracy, which must shake our confidence in the certainty of his whole 
genealogy. 
<P>The genealogy of Luke, considered separately, does not present so many 
defects as that of Matthew. It has no concluding statement of the number of 
generations comprised in the genealogy, to act as a check upon itself, neither 
can it be tested, to much extent, by a comparison with the Old Testament. For, 
from David to Nathan, the line traced by Luke has no correspondence with any Old 
Testament genealogy, excepting in two of its members, Salathiel and Zorobabel; 
and even with respect to these two, there is a contradiction between the 
statement of Luke and that of 1 Chron. iii. 17. 19. f.: for the former calls 
Salathiel a son of Neri, whilst, according to the latter, he was the son of 
Jechoniah. Luke also mentions one Resa as the son of Zorobabel, a name which 
does not appear amongst the children of Zerubbabel in 1 Chron. iii. 17. 19. 
Also, in the series before Abraham, Luke inserts a Cainan, who is not to be 
found in the Hebrew text, Gen. x. 24; xi. 12 ff., but who was however already 
inserted by the LXX. In fact the original text has this name in its first series 
as the third from Adam, and thence the translation appears to have transplanted 
him to the corresponding place in the second series as the third from Noah. 
<P>§ 21. COMPARISON OF THE TWO GENEALOGIES—ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THEIR 
CONTRADICTIONS. 
<P>If we compare the genealogies of Matthew and Luke together, we become aware 
of still more striking discrepancies. Some of these differences indeed are 
unimportant, as the opposite direction of the two tables, the line of Matthew 
descending from Abraham to Jesus, that of Luke ascending from Jesus to his 
ancestors. Also the greater extent of the line of Luke; Matthew deriving it no 
farther than from Abraham, while Luke (perhaps lengthening some existing 
document in order to make it more consonant with the universalism of the 
doctrines of Paul*:) carries it back to Adam and to God himself. More important 
is the considerable difference in the number of generations for equal periods, 
Luke having 41 between David and Jesus, whilst Matthew has only 26. The main 
difficulty, however, lies in this: that in some parts of the genealogy, in Luke 
totally different individuals are made the ancestors of Jesus from those in 
Matthew. It is true, both writers agree in de- riving the lineage of Jesus 
through Joseph from David and Abraham, and that the names of'the individual 
members of the series
<P>*See Chrysostom and Luther, in Credner, Einleitung in d. N. T., 1, S. 143 f. 
Winer, bibl. Realwörterbuch, 1. s. 659.
<P>
<CENTER>98</CENTER>
<P>correspond from Abraham to David, as well as two of the names in the 
subsequent portion: those of Salathiel and Zorobabel. But the difficulty becomes 
desperate when we find that, with these two exceptions about midway, the whole 
of the names from David to the foster-father of Jesus arc totally different in 
Matthew and in Luke. In Matthew, the father of Joseph is called Jacob; in Luke, 
Heli. In Matthew, the son of David through whom Joseph descended from that king 
is Solomon; in Luke, Nathan: and so on, the line descends, in Matthew, through 
the race of known kings; in Luke, through an unknown collateral branch, 
coinciding only with respect to Salathiel and Zorobabel, whilst they still 
differ in the names of the father of Salathiel and the son of Zorobabel. Since 
this difference appears to offer a complete contradiction, the most industrious 
efforts have been made at all times to reconcile the two. Passing in silence 
explanations evidently unsatisfactory, such as a mystical signification*, or an 
arbitrary change of names†, we shall consider two pairs of hypotheses which have 
been most conspicuous, and are mutually supported, or at least bear affinity to 
one another. 
<P>The first pair is formed upon the presupposition of Augustine, that Joseph 
was an adopted son, and that one evangelist gave the name of his real, the other 
that of his adopted father‡; and the opinion of the old chronologist Julius 
Africanus, that a Levirate marriage had taken place between the parents of 
Joseph, and that the one genealogy belonged to the natural, the other to the 
legal, father of Joseph, by the one of whom he was descended from David through 
Solomon, by the other through Nathan.§ The farther question : to which father do 
the respective genealogies belong ? is open to two species of criticism, the one 
founded upon literal expressions, the other upon the spirit and character of 
each gospel: and which lead to opposite conclusions. Augustine as well as 
Africanus, has observed, that Matthew makes use of an expression in describing 
the relationship between Joseph and his so-called father, which more definitely 
points out the natural filial relationship than that of Luke: for the former 
says &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;: whilst the expression of the latter,&gt;GREEK FOR 
PETER&lt;, appears equally applicable to a son by adoption, or by virtue of a 
Levirate marriage. But since the very object of a Levirate marriage was to 
maintain the name and race of a deceased childless brother, it was the Jewish 
custom to inscribe the firstborn son of such a marriage, not on the family 
register of his natural father, as Matthew has done here, but on that of his 
legal father, as Luke has done on the above supposition. Now that a person so 
entirely imbued with Jewish opinions as the author of the first gospel, should 
have made a mistake of this kind,

<P>cannot be held probable. Accordingly, Schleiermacher and others conceive 
themselves bound by the spirit of the two gospels to admit that Matthew, in 
spite of his &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;, must have given the lineage of the legal 
father, according to Jewish custom: whilst Luke, who perhaps was not born a Jew, 
and was less familiar with Jewish habits, might have fallen upon the genealogy 
of the younger brothers of Joseph, who were not, like the firstborn, inscribed 
amongst the family of the deceased legal father, but with that of their natural 
father, and might have taken this for the genealogical table of the first-born 
Joseph, whilst it really belonged to him only by natural descent, to which 
Jewish genealogists paid no regard.* But, besides the fact which we shall show 
hereafter, that the genealogy of Luke can with difficulty be proved to be the 
work of the author of that Gospel;-in which case the little acquaintance of Luke 
with Jewish customs ceases to afford any clue to the meaning of this 
genealogy;-it is also to be objected, that the genealogist of the first gospel 
could not have written his &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; thus without any addition, if 
he was thinking of a mere legal paternity. Wherefore these two views of the 
genealogical relationship are equally difficult. 
<P>However, this hypothesis, which we have hitherto considered only in general, 
requires a more detailed examination in order to judge of its admissibility. In 
considering the proposition of a Levirate marriage, the argument is essentially 
the same if, with Augustine and Africanus, we ascribe the naming of the natural 
father to Matthew, or with Schleiermacher, to Luke. As an example we shall adopt 
the former statement; the rather because Eusebius, according to Africanus, has 
left us a minute account of it. According to this representation, then, the 
mother of Joseph was first married to that person whom Luke calls the father of 
Joseph, namely Heli. But since Heli died without children, by virtue of the 
Levirate law, his brother, called by Matthew Jacob the father of Joseph, married 
the widow, and by her begot Joseph, who was legally regarded as the son of the 
deceased Heli, and so described by Luke, whilst naturally he was the son of his 
brother Jacob, and thus described by Matthew. 
<P>But, merely thus far, the hypothesis is by no means adequate. For if the two 
fathers of Joseph were real brothers, sons of the same father, they had one and 
the same lineage, and the two genealogies would have differed only in the father 
of Joseph, all the preceding portion being in agreement. In order to explain how 
the discordancy extends so far back as to David, we must have recourse to the 
second proposition of Africanus, that the fathers of Joseph were only 
half-brothers, having the same mother, but not the same father. We must also 
suppose that this mother of the two fathers of Joseph, had twice married; once 
with the Matthan of Matthew, who was descended from David through Solomon and 
the line of kings, and to whom she bore Jacob; and also, either before or after, 
with the
<P>* S. 53. Comp. Winer, bibl. Realwörterbuch, 1 Bd. s. 660
<P>
<CENTER>100</CENTER>
<P>Matthat of Luke, the offspring of which marriage was Heli: which Heli, having 
married and died childless, his half-brother Jacob married his widow, and begot 
for the deceased his legal child Joseph. 
<P>This hypothesis of so complicated a marriage in two successive generations, 
to which we are forced by the discrepancy of the two genealogies, must be 
acknowledged to be in no way impossible, but still highly improbable: and the 
difficulty is doubled by the untoward agreement already noticed, which occurs 
midway in the discordant series, in the two members Salathiel and Zorobabel. For 
to explain how Neri in Luke, and Jechonias in Matthew, are both called the 
father of Salathiel, who was the father of Zorobabel;-not only must the 
supposition of the Levirate marriage be repeated, but also that the two brothers 
who successively married the same wife, were brothers only on the mother's side. 
The difficulty is not diminished by the remark, that any nearest blood-relation, 
not only a brother, might succeed in a Levirate marriage,-that is to say, though 
not obligatory, it was at least open to his choice. (Ruth iii. 12. f. iv. 4 f.*) 
.For since even in the case of two cousins, the concurrence of the two branches 
must take place much earlier than here for Jacob and Heli, and for Jechonias and 
Neri, we are still obliged to have recourse to the hypothesis of half-brothers; 
the only amelioration in this hypothesis over the other being, that these two 
very peculiar marriages do not take place in immediately consecutive 
generations. Now that this extraordinary double incident should not only have 
been twice repeated, but that the genealogists should twice have made the same 
selection in their statements respecting the natural and the legal father, and 
without any explanation,-is so improbable, that even the hypothesis of an 
adoption which is burdened with only one-half of these difficulties, has still 
more than it can bear. For in the case of adoption, since no fraternal or other 
relationship is required, between the natural and adopting fathers, the 
recurrence to a twice-repeated half-brotherhood is dispensed with; leaving only 
the necessity for twice supposing a relationship by adoption, and twice the 
peculiar circumstance, that the one genealogist from want of acquaintance with 
Jewish customs was ignorant of the fact, and the other, although he took account 
of it, was silent respecting it. 
<P>It has been thought by later critics that the knot may be loosed in a much 
easier way, by supposing that in one gospel we have the genealogy of Joseph, in 
the other that of Mary, in which case there would be no contradiction in the 
disagreement:† to which they are pleased to add the assumption that Mary was an 
heiress.‡ The opinion that Mary was of the race of David as well as Joseph has 
been long held. Following indeed the idea, that the Messiah, as a second 
Melchizedec, ought to unite in his person the priestly with

<P>the kingly dignity*, and guided by the relationship of Mary with Elizabeth, 
who was a daughter of Aaron (Luke i. 36); already in early times it was not only 
held by many that the races of Judah and Levi were blended in the family of 
Joseph†; but also the opinion was not rare that Jesus, deriving his royal 
lineage from Joseph, descended also from the priestly race through Mary.‡ The 
opinion of Mary's descent from David, soon however became the more prevailing. 
Many apocryphal writers clearly state this opinion§, as well as Justin Martyr, 
whose expression, that the virgin was of the race of David, Jacob, Isaac, and 
Abraham, may be considered an indication that he applied to Mary one of our 
genealogies, which are both traced back to Abraham through David.||
<P>On inquiring which of these two genealogies is to be held that of Mary? we 
are stopped by an apparently insurmountable obstacle, since each is distinctly 
announced as the genealogy of Joseph; the one in the words &gt;GREEK FOR 
PETER&lt; the other by the phrase &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;. Here also, however, 
the &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; of Matthew is more definite than the &gt;GREEK FOR 
PETER&lt; of Luke, which according to those interpreters may mean just as well a 
son-in-law or grandson; so that the genitive of Luke in iii. 23 was either 
intended to express that Jesus was in common estimation a son of Joseph, who was 
the son- in-law of Heli, the father of Mary**:-or else, that Jesus was, as was 
believed, a son of Joseph, and through Mary a grandson of Heli.*** As it may 
here be objected, that the Jews in their genealogies were accustomed to take no 
account of the female line,**** a farther hypothesis is had recourse to, namely, 
that Mary was an heiress, <I>i.e.</I> the daughter of a father without sons; and 
that in this case, according to Numbers xxxvi. 6, and Nehemiah vii. 63, Jewish 
custom required that the person who married her should not only be of the same 
race with herself, but that he should henceforth sink his own family in hers, 
and take her ancestors as his own. But the first point only is proved by the 
reference to Numbers; and the passage in Nehemiah, compared with several similar 
ones, (Ezra ii. 61; Numbers xxxii. 41; comp. with 1 Chron. ii. 21 f.) shows only 
that sometimes, by way of exception, a man took the name of his maternal 
ancestors. Tins difficulty with regard to Jewish customs, however, is cast into 
shade by one much more important. Although undeniably the genitive case used by 
Luke, expressing simply derivation in a general

<P>sense, may signify any degree of relationship, and consequently that of 
son-in-law or grandson; yet this interpretation destroys the consistency of the 
whole passage. In the thirty-four preceding members, which are well known to us 
from the Old Testament, this genitive demonstrably indicates throughout the 
precise relationship of a son; likewise when it occurs between Salathiel and 
Zorobabel: how could it be intended in the one instance of Joseph to indicate 
that of son- in-law? or, according to the other interpretation, supposing the 
nominative &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; to govern the whole series, how can we 
suppose it to change its signification from son to grandson, great-grandson, and 
so on to the end? If it be said the phrase &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; is a proof 
that the genitive does not necessarily indicate a son in the proper sense of the 
word, we may reply that it bears a signification with regard to the immediate 
Author of existence equally inapplicable to either father-in-law or grandfather. 

<P>A further difficulty is encountered by this explanation of the two 
genealogies in common with the former one, in the concurrence of the two names 
of Salathiel and Zorobabel. The supposition of a Levirate marriage is as 
applicable to this explanation as the other, but the interpreters we are now 
examining prefer for the most part to suppose, that these similar names in the 
different genealogies belong to different persons. When Luke however, in the 
twenty-first and twenty-second generations from David, gives the very same names 
that Matthew (including the four omitted generations), gives in the nineteenth 
and twentieth, one of these names being of great notoriety, it is certainly 
impossible to doubt that they refer to the same persons. 
<P>Moreover, in no other part of the New Testament is there any trace to be 
found of the Davidical descent of Mary: on the contrary, some passages are 
directly opposed to it. In Luke i. 27, the expression &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; 
refers only to the immediately preceding &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;, not to the 
more remote &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;. And more pointed still is the turn of the 
sentence Luke ii. 4&gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;, where &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; might 
so easily have been written instead of &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt;, if the author 
had any thought of including Mary in the descent from David. These expressions 
fill to overflowing the measure of proof already adduced, that it is impossible 
to apply the genealogy of the third Evangelist to Mary. 
<P>§ 22. THE GENEALOGIES UNHISTORICAL. 
<P>A consideration of the insurmountable difficulties, which unavoidably 
embarrass every attempt to bring these two genealogies into harmony with one 
another, will lead us to despair of reconciling them, and will incline us to 
acknowledge, with the more
<P>
<CENTER>103</CENTER>
<P>free-thinking class of critics, that they are mutually contradictory.* 
Consequently they cannot both be true: if, therefore, one is to be preferred 
before the other, several circumstances would seem to decide in favour of the 
genealogy of Luke, rather than that of Matthew. It does not exhibit an arbitrary 
adherence to a fixed form and to equal periods: and whilst the ascribing of 
twenty generations to the space of time from David to Jechonias or Neri, in 
Luke, is at least not more offensive to probability, than the omission of four 
generations in Matthew to historical truth; Luke's allotment of twenty-two 
generations for the period from Jechonias (born 617 B.C.) to Jesus, <I>i.e.</I> 
about 600 years, forming an average of twenty-seven years and a half to each 
generation, is more consonant with natural events, particularly amongst eastern 
nations, than the thirteen generations of Matthew, which make an average of 
forty-two years for each. Besides the genealogy of Luke is less liable than that 
of Matthew to the suspicion of having been written with a design to glorify 
Jesus, since it contents itself with ascribing to Jesus a descent from David, 
without tracing that descent through the royal line. On the other hand, however, 
it is more improbable that the genealogy of the comparatively insignificant 
family of Nathan should have been preserved, than that of the royal branch. 
Added to which, the frequent recurrence of the same names is, as justly remarked 
by Hoffmann, an indication that the genealogy of Luke is fictitious. 
<P>In fact then neither table has any advantage over the other. If the one is 
unhistorieal, so also is the other, since it is very improbable that the 
genealogy of an obscure family like that of Joseph, extending through so long a 
series of generations, should have been preserved during all the confusion of 
the exile, and the disturbed period that followed. Yet, it may be said, although 
we recognize in both, so far as they are not copied from the Old Testament, an 
unrestrained play of the imagination, or arbitrary applications of Other 
genealogies to Jesus,-we may still retain as an historical basis that Jesus was 
descended from David, and that only the intermediate members of the line of 
descent were variously filled up by different writers. But the one event on 
which this historical basis is mainly supported, namely, the journey of the 
parents of Jesus to Bethlehem in order to be taxed, so far from sufficing to 
prove them to be of the house and lineage of David, is itself, as we shall 
presently show, by no means established as matter of history. Of more weight is 
the other ground, namely, that Jesus is universally represented in the New 
Testament, without any contradiction from his adversaries, as the descendant of 
David. Yet even the phrase &gt;GREEK FOR PETER&lt; is a predicate that may 
naturally have been applied to Jesus, not on historical, but on dogmatical 
grounds. According to the

<P>prophecies, the Messiah could only spring from David. When therefore a 
Galilean, whose lineage was utterly unknown, and of whom consequently no one 
could prove that he was not descended from David, had acquired the reputation of 
being the Messiah; what more natural than that tradition should under different 
forms have early ascribed to him a Davidical descent, and that genealogical 
tables, corresponding with this tradition, should have been formed? which, 
however, as they were constructed upon no certain data, would necessarily 
exhibit such differences and contradictions as we find actually existing between 
the genealogies in Matthew and in Luke.*
<P>If, in conclusion, it be asked, what historical result is to be deduced from 
these genealogies ? we reply: a conviction, (arrived at also from other 
sources,) that Jesus, either in his own person or through his disciples, acting 
upon minds strongly imbued with Jewish notions and expectations, left among his 
followers so firm a conviction of his Messiahship, that they did not hesitate to 
attribute to him the prophetical characteristic of Davidical descent, and more 
than one pen was put in action, in order, by means of a genealogy which should 
authenticate that descent, to justify his recognition as the Messiah.†
<P>*See De Wette, bibl. Dogm. and exeg. Handb. 1, 1, S. 14 ; Hase, L. J. 
Eusebius gives a not improbable explanation of this disagreement (ad. Steph. 
quæst. iii., pointed out by Credner, 1, p. 68 f.) that besides the notion 
amongst the Jews, that the Messiah must spring from the royal line of David, 
another had arisen, that this line having become polluted and declared unworthy 
of continuing on the throne of David (Jerem. xxii. 30), by the wickedness of its 
later reigning members, a line more pure though less famed was to be preferred 
to it. 
<P>† The farther consideration on the origin and import of these genealogies, 
which arise from their connexion with the acount of the miraculous birth of 
Jesus, must be reserved till after the examination of the latter point.
