<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">THE 
ASCENSION.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">§ 141. THE LAST COMMANDS AND PROMISES OF 
JESUS.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the last interview of Jesus with his 
disciples, which according to Mark and Luke closed with the ascension, the three 
first Evangelists (the fourth has something similar on the very first interview) 
represent Jesus as delivering testamentary commands and promises, which referred 
to the establishment and propagation of the messianic kingdom of earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;With regard to the commands, Jesus in 
Luke (xxiv. 47 f.; Acts i. 8) in parting from his disciples appoints them to be 
witnesses of his messiahship, and charges them to preach <i>repentance and 
remission of sins </i>in his name from Jerusalem to the uttermost parts of the 
earth. In Mark (xvi. 15 f.) he enjoins them to go into all the world and bring 
to every creature the glad tidings of the messianic kingdom founded by him; he 
who believes and is baptized will be saved, he who believeth not, will (in the 
future messianic judgment) be condemned. In Matthew (xxviii. 19 f.) the 
disciples are also commissioned to make disciples of <i>all nations </i></span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">panta ta eqnh,</span><span lang="EN-US"> 
and here baptism is not mentioned incidentally merely, as in Mark, but is made 
the subject of an express command by Jesus, and is besides more precisely 
described as a baptism <i>in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost,</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">eiV to onoma tou</span><span lang="EN-US">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The impediments to the supposition that 
Jesus delivered to his disciples the express command to carry the announcement 
of the gospel to the Gentiles, have been already pointed out in an earlier 
connexion.<sup>* &nbsp;</sup>But that this more definite form of baptism proceeded 
from Jesus, is also opposed by the fact, that such an allocation of Father, Son, 
and Spirit does not elsewhere appear, except as a form </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;of salutation in apostolic epistles (2 
Cor. xiii. 14: <i>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, </i>etc.); while as a more 
definite form of baptism it is not to be met with throughout the whole New 
Testament save in the above passage of the first gospel: for in the apostolic 
epistles and even in the Acts, baptism is designated as a </span>

or <i>in the name of the Lord Jesus, </i>or their equivalent (Rom. vi. 3; Gal. 
iii. 27; Acts ii. 38, viii. 16, x. 48, xix. 5), and the same threefold reference 
to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit is only found in ecclesiastical writers, as, 
for example, Justin.<sup>* &nbsp;</sup>Indeed the formula in Matthew sounds so 
exactly as if it had been borrowed from the ecclesiastical ritual, that there is 
no slight probability in the supposition. that it was transferred from thence 
into the mouth of Jesus. But this does not authorize us to throw the passage out 
of the text as an interpolation,<sup>† &nbsp;</sup>since, if everything in the 
gospels which cannot have happened to Jesus, or which cannot have been done or 
spoken by him in the manner there described, were to be pro­nounced foreign to 
the original text, the interpolations would soon become too numerous. So far it 
is with justice that others have defended the genuineness of the baptismal 
formula ; <sup>‡ </sup>&nbsp;but their grounds for the assertion that it was 
delivered in this manner by Jesus himself are insufficient: the two opinions 
then resolve themselves into a third, namely, that this more definite form of 
baptism does indeed belong to the original context of the first gospel, but 
without having been so delivered by Jesus.<sup>§ &nbsp;</sup>Jesus had, during his 
life, predicted in divers ways the propagation of his kingdom beyond the limits 
of the Jewish nation, perhaps also had intimated the intro­duction of baptism to 
be his will; and—whether it be the fact that, as we learn in the fourth gospel, 
the disciples already practised baptism in the life. time of Jesus, or that they 
first made this rite a sign of reception into the new messianic society after 
his death,—in any case it was entirely in the manner of the legend to place the 
injunction to baptize, as well as to go out into all the world, in the mouth of 
the departing Christ as a last declaration of his will.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The promises which Jesus gives to his 
adherents in parting from them, are in Matthew, where they are directed 
exclusively to the eleven, limited simply to the assurance that he, to whom as 
the exalted Messiah all power was de­livered both in heaven and on earth, would 
be invisibly with them during the present <i>age, </i></span>

Luke, which place the impartation of the Holy Spirit in the days after the 
ascension, seem to be in contradiction with the statement of the fourth gospel, 
that Jesus communicated the Holy Spirit to his disciples in the days of his 
resurrection, nay, on his very first appearance in the circle of the eleven. In 
John xx. 22 f. we read, that Jesus, ap­pearing among the disciples when the 
doors were closed, breathed on them and said: <i>Receive ye the Holy Ghost, </i>
</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">labete pneuma agion</span><i><span lang="EN-US">,
</span></i><span lang="EN-US">wherewith he con­nected the authority to remit and 
retain sins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;If this were the only passage relating 
to the impartation of the Spirit, every one would believe that the disciples had 
it commuicated to them by Jesus when he was personally present among them, and 
not first after his exaltation to heaven. But in accordance with the harmonizing 
interest, it has been con­cluded, first by Theodore of Mopsuestia, and recently 
by Tholuck,<sup>† &nbsp;</sup>that the word </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">labete</span><span lang="EN-US">,
<i>receive, </i>in John,<i> </i>must be taken in the sense of </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">lhyesqe</span><i><span lang="EN-US">, 
ye shall receive, </span></i><span lang="EN-US">because <i>according to Luke </i>
the Holy Spirit was not imparted to the disciples until later, at Pentecost. But 
as if he wished to preclude, such a wresting of his words, the Jesus of John 
adds to them the symbolical action of breathing on the disciples, which 
unmistakably represents the <i>receiving </i>of the Holy Spirit as a present 
fact,<sup>‡ &nbsp;</sup>It is true that expositors have found out a way of eluding 
even this act of breathing, by attributing to it the following signification: as 
certainly as Jesus now breathes upon them, so certainly </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;will they at a future time receive the 
Holy Ghost.<sup>* &nbsp;</sup>But the act of breathing upon a person is as decided a 
symbol of a present impartation as the laying on of hands, and as those on whom 
the apostles laid their hands were immediately filled with the Spirit (Acts 
viii. 17, xix. 6), so, according to the above narra­tive, the author of the 
fourth gospel must have thought that the Apostles on that occasion received the 
Spirit from Jesus. In order to avoid the necessity of denying, in opposition to 
the clear meaning of John, that an impartation of the Spirit actually took place 
immediately after the resurrection, or of coming into contradiction with Luke, 
who assigns the outpouring of the Spirit to a later period, expositors now 
ordinarily suppose that the Spirit was granted to the Apostles both at the 
earlier and the later period, the impartation at Pente­cost being only an 
increasing and perfecting of, the former.<sup>† </sup>&nbsp;Or more cor­rectly, since 
Matthew x. <i>20 </i>speaks of the <i>Spirit of the Father </i>as already 
sustaining the disciples in their first mission: it is supposed that they were 
first endowed with some extraordinary power before that mission, in the 
life­time of Jesus; that on the occasion in question, shortly after his 
resurrection, he heightened this power; but that all the fulness of the Spirit 
was not poured out upon them until Pentecost.<sup>‡ &nbsp;</sup>What constitutes the 
distinction between these steps, and especially in what the increase of the 
gifts of the Spirit con­sisted in the present instance, is, however, as 
Michaelis has already remarked, not easy to discern. If in the first instance 
the apostles were endowed with the<i> </i>power of working miracles (Matt. x. 1, 
8) together with the gift of speak­ing freely (</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">parrhsia</span><span lang="EN-US">)<i>
</i>before tribunals (v. 20),<i> </i>it could only be a more correct insight 
into the spirituality of his kingdom that Jesus communicated to them by 
breathing on them; but of this they were still destitute immediately before the 
ascension, when, according to Acts i. 6, they asked whether, with the 
impartation of the Spirit, within the next few days, would be associated the 
restoration of the kingdom to Israel. If however it be supposed that each 
successive impartation of the Spirit conferred no new powers on the disciples, 
but was merely an addition in measure to that which was already present in all 
its diversified powers :<sup>§ </sup>&nbsp;it must still be held surprising that no 
Evangelist mentions, together with an earlier impartation, a later 
amplification; but instead of this, besides an incidental mention of the Spirit 
as enabling the dis­ciples to defend themselves before tribunals, in Luke (xii. 
12),—which, since it is not here, as in Matthew, connected with a mission, may 
be regarded merely as a reference to the time after the later outpouring of the 
Spirit,—each of the Evangelists mentions only one impartation, and represents 
this as the first and last. This is, indeed, a clear proof that, to place in 
juxtaposition three impartations and to regard them as so many different 
degrees, is only an effort to harmonize </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;the gospels by introducing into them 
what is foreign to the text.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;Thus there are in the New Testament 
three distinct opinions concerning the impartation of the Spirit to the 
disciples of Jesus; and in two respects they form a climax. As regards the time, 
Matthew places the impartation the earliest—within the period of the natural 
life of Jesus; Luke, the latest— in the time after his complete departure from 
the earth; John in an inter­mediate position—in the days of the resurrection. As 
regards the conception of the fact, it is the simplest in Matthew, the least 
perceptible to the senses, for he has no special and external act of 
impartation; John already has such a feature, in the act of breathing on the 
disciples; while with Luke, in the Acts, the gentle breathing has become a 
violent storm, which shakes the house, and with which other miraculous 
appearances are united. These two series of gradations stand in opposite 
relations to historical probability. That the <i>Spirit </i></span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">pneuma</span><i><span lang="EN-US">,
</span></i><span lang="EN-US">which, whether it be regarded as natural or as 
supernatural, is in either case the animating power of the messianic idea in its 
Christian modification, was communicated to the adherents of Jesus so early as 
Matthew narrates, is contradicted by his own representation, for according to 
him, that Chris­tian modification—the introduction of the characteristics of 
suffering and death into the idea of the Messiah,—was not comprehended by the 
disciples long after the mission described in Matt x.; and as the discourse of 
instruc­tions there given contains other particulars also, which will only suit 
later times and circumstances: it is easy to imagine that the promise in 
question may have been erroneously referred to that earlier period. Only after 
the death and resurrection of Jesus can we conceive what the New Testament calls 
the </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">pneuma agion </span>
<span lang="EN-US">to have been developed in the disciples, and in so far the 
representation of John stands nearer to reality than that of Matthew; but, as 
certainly the revolution in the sentiments of the disciples described in the 
foregoing section, had not taken place so early as two days after the 
cruci­fixion: the account of John does not approach so near to the truth as that 
of Luke, who allows an interval of at least fifty days for the formation of the 
new opinions in the disciples. The position of the narratives with respect to 
historical truth is reversed by the other climax. For in proportion as a 
narrative represents the impartation of a spiritual power as perceptible to the 
senses, the formation of a sentiment which might spring from natural causes as 
miraculous, the origin of a faculty which can only have been developed 
gradu­.ally, as instantaneous: in the same proportion does such a narrative 
diverge from the truth; and in this respect, Matthew would stand at the least 
distance from the truth, Luke at the greatest. If we therefore recognise in the 
repre­presentation of the latter the most mature product of tradition, it may be 
wondered how tradition can have wrought in two opposite ways: receding from
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;858</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;the truth in relation to the 
determination of the manner and form of the impartation, approaching the truth 
in relation to the determination of the time. But this is explained as soon as 
it is considered, that in the changes in the determination of the time, 
tradition was not guided by critical inquiry after truth—this might well have 
caused surprise,—but by the same tendency that led to the other alteration, 
namely, to present the impartation of the Spirit as a single miraculous act. If 
Jesus was said to have shed the Spirit on his disciples by a special act: it 
must seem appropriate to assign this act to his state of glorification, and thus 
either with John to place it after the resurrection, or with Luke after the 
ascension; indeed the fourth Evangelist expressly remarks that in the lifetime 
of Jesus, the Spirit was not yet given, <i>because Jesus was not yet glorified
</i>(vii. 39).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;This interpretation of the opinion of 
the fourth Evangelist concerning the impartation of the Spirit to the disciples, 
is attested as the correct one by the fact, that it throws unexpected light on 
an obscurity in his gospel with respect to which we were previously unable to 
come to a decision. In relation to the farewell discourses of Jesus, it was not 
possible to settle the dispute, whether what Jesus there says of his return is 
to be referred to the days of his resurrection, or to the outpouring of the 
Spirit, because the description of that return as a <i>seeing again </i>seemed 
to speak as decidedly for the former, as the observation that in that time they 
would no longer ask him anything, and. would understand him fully, for the 
latter: a dispute which is decided in the most welcome manner, if it can be 
shown to be the opinion of the narrator that the impartation of the Spirit fell 
in the days of the resurrection.<sup>* &nbsp;</sup>At first indeed it might be 
thought, that this impartation, especially as in John it is connected with the 
formal appointment of his disciples as his envoys, and the communication of the 
authority to remit and retain sins (comp. Matt, xviii. i8), would have been more 
appropriate at the close than the commencement of the appearances of the risen 
Jesus, and in a full assembly of the Apostles than in one from which Thomas was 
absent; but on this account to suppose with Olshausen that the Evangelist for 
the sake of brevity merely appends the impartation of the Spirit to the first 
appearance, though it really belonged to a later interview, is an inadmissible 
violence; and we must rather allow, that the author of the fourth gospel 
regarded this first appearance of Jesus as the principal one, and the one eight 
days later as merely supernumerary in favour of Thomas. The appearance chap. 
xxi. is also a supplement, which the author, when he wrote his gospel, either 
had not known, or at least did not recollect.</span></p>

CONSIDERED AS A SUPERNATURAL AND AS A NATURAL EVENT.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;The ascension of Jesus is reported to 
us in the New Testament in three different narratives, which in point of fulness 
of detail and </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;picturesqueness of description form a 
progressive series. Mark, who in the last portion of his gospel is in general 
very brief and abrupt, only says, that after Jesus had spoken to the disciples 
for the last time, he was received up (</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">anelhfqh</span><span lang="EN-US">) 
into heaven and sat on the right hand of God (xvi. 19). With scarcely more 
definiteness it is said in the gospel of Luke that Jesus led his disciples <i>
out as far as Bethany, </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">
exw ewV eiV Bhqanian</span><span lang="EN-US">, and while he here with uplifted 
hands gave them his blessing, he was parted from them (</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">diesth)</span><span lang="EN-US">,<i>
</i>and carried up into heaven (</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">aneferato</span><span lang="EN-US">);<i>
</i>whereupon the disciples fell down and worshipped him, and forthwith returned 
to Jerusalem with great joy (xxiv. 50 ff.).<i> </i>In the introduction to the 
Acts, Luke gives more ample details concerning this scene. On the mount of 
Olives, where Jesus delivered to his disciples his last commands and promises, 
he was taken up before their eyes (</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">ephrqh)</span><i><span lang="EN-US">,
</span></i><span lang="EN-US">and a cloud received him out of their sight. While 
the disciples were watching him, as he went up into heaven on the cloud, there 
suddenly stood by them two men in white apparel, who induced them to desist from 
thus gazing after him by the assurance, that the Jesus now taken from them would 
come again from heaven in the same manner as he had just ascended into heaven; 
on which they were satisfied, and returned to Jerusalem (i. 1—12).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;The first impression from this 
narrative is clearly this: that it is intended as a description of a miraculous 
event, an actual exaltation of Jesus into heaven, as the dwelling-place of God, 
and an attestation of this by angels ; as orthodox theologians, both ancient and 
modern, correctly maintain. The only question is, whether they can also help us 
to surmount the difficulties which stand in our way when we attempt to form a 
conception of such an event? One main difficulty is this: how can a palpable 
body, which has <i>still flesh and bones, </i>and eats material food, be 
qualified for a celestial abode? how can it so far liberate itself from the laws 
of gravity, as to be capable of an ascent through the air? and how can it be 
conceived that God gave so preternatural a capability to Jesus by a miracle?<sup>* 
&nbsp;</sup>The only possible reply to these questions is, that the grosser elements 
which the body of Jesus still retained after the resurrection, were removed 
before the ascension, and only the finest essence of his corporeality, as the 
integument of the soul, was taken by him into heaven.<sup>† &nbsp;</sup>But as the 
disciples who were present at the ascension observed no residuum of his body 
which he had left behind, this leads either to the above mentioned absurdity of 
an evaporation of the body of Jesus, or to Olshausen’s process of subtilization 
which, still incomplete even after the resurrection, was not perfected until the 
moment of the ascension; a process which must have been conducted with 
singularly rapid retrograde transitions in these last days, if the body of 
Jesus, when penetrating into the closed room where </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;the disciples were assembled, is to be 
supposed immaterial; immediately after when Thomas touched him, material; and 
lastly, in the ascension, again immaterial. The other difficulty lies in the 
consideration, that according to a just idea of the world, the seat of God and 
of the blessed, to which Jesus is supposed to have been exalted, is not to be 
sought for in the upper regions of the air, nor, in general, in any determinate 
place ;—such a locality could only be assigned to it in the childish, limited 
conceptions of antiquity. We are well aware that he who would attain to God and 
the circle of the blessed would make a superfluous circuit, if he thought it 
necessary for this purpose to soar aloft into the higher regions of the 
firmament; and the more intimately Jesus was acquainted with God and divine 
things, the farther certainly would he be from making such a circuit, or from 
being caused to make it by God.<sup>* &nbsp;</sup>Thus there would be no other 
resource than to suppose a divine accommodation to the idea of the world in that 
age, and to say: God in order to convince the disciples of the return of Jesus 
into the higher world, although this world is in reality by no means to be 
sought for in the upper air, nevertheless prepared the spectacle of such an 
exaltation.<sup>† &nbsp;</sup>But this is to represent God as theatrically arranging 
an illusion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;As an attempt to set us free from such 
difficulties and absurdities, the natural explanation of this narrative must 
needs be welcome.<sup>‡ &nbsp;</sup>This distinguishes in the evangelical accounts of

that Jesus while communicating his blessing to the disciples should be carried

outstretched hand as a symbol of his blessing. Thus the natural explanation of 
the disappearance in the cloud falls to the ground of itself; while in the 
supposition that the two individuals clothed in white apparel were natural men, 
Paulus only disguises a final and strongly marked essay of the opinion espoused 
by Bahrdt and Venturini, that several epochs in the life of Jesus, especially 
after his crucifixion, were brought about by the agency of secret colleagues. 
And Jesus himself—what, according to this opinion, must we suppose to have 
become of him after this last separation from his disciples? Shall we, with 
Bahrdt, dream of an Essene lodge, into which he retired after the completion of 
his work? and with Brennecke appeal, in proof that Jesus long continued silently 
to work for the welfare of mankind, to his appearance for the purpose of the 
conversion of Paul? But, taking the narrative of the Acts as historical, this 
was connected with circumstances and effects which could be produced by no 
natural man, even though a member of a secret order. Or shall we with Paulus 
suppose, that shortly after the last interview the body of Jesus sank beneath 
the injuries it had received? This could not well have happened in the very next 
moments after he had appeared still active among his disciples, so that the two 
men who joined them might have been witnesses of his decease,— who, even 
admitting this, would not have spoken in accordance with the truth; but if he 
continued to live for any length of time he must have had the intention to 
remain for that period in the concealment of a secret society; and to this must 
then be supposed to belong the two men clothed in white, who, doubtless with his 
previous sanction, persuaded the disciples that he had ascended into heaven.<sup>*

every other, a sound judgment must turn away with aversion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;one, but apart from all prior 
conclusions and in every point of view. Matthew and John, who according to the 
common idea were the two eyewitnesses among the Evangelists, do not mention it; 
it is narrated by Mark and Luke alone, while in the rest of the New Testament 
writings decided allusions to it are wanting. But this absence of allusions to 
the ascension in the rest of the New Testament is denied by orthodox expositors. 
When, say they, Jesus in Matthew (xxvi. 64), declares before the high priest, 
that hereafter the Son of Man will be seen sitting at the right hand of God: 
this presupposes an exaltation thither, consequently an ascension; when in John 
(iii. 13), he says, no one hath ascended into heaven but the Son of Man who came 
from heaven, and at another time (vi. 62) tells the disciples that they will 
hereafter see him ascend where he was before; further, when on the morning of 
the resurrection he declares that he is not yet ascended to his Father, implying 
that he is about to do so (xx. 17): there could hardly be more explicit 
allusions to the ascension; again, when the apostles in the Acts so often speak 
of an exaltation of Jesus to the right hand of God (ii. 33, v. 31, comp. vii. 
56),<i> </i>and Paul represents him as <i>ascended up far above all heavens </i>

exaltation to heaven, without intimating that it was an external, visible fact, 
that took place in the presence of the disciples. Rather, when we find Paul in 1<i>
</i>Cor. xv. 5 ff<i>. </i>ranking the appearance of Jesus to himself, which 
occurred long after the alleged ascension, with the Christophanies before this 
epoch, so entirely without any pause or indication of a distinction: we must 
doubt, not merely that all the appearances which he enumerates besides his own 
can have occurred before the ascension,<sup>† </sup>&nbsp;but whether the Apostle can 
have had any knowledge at all of an ascension as an external fact which closed 
the earthly life of Jesus. As to the author of the fourth gospel,—in his

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;Commentators have, it is true, taken 
all possible pains to explain the want of a narrative of the ascension in the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">either unnecessary, or impossible, to 
narrate the ascension. They held it unnecessary, say these expositors, either 
intrinsically, from the minor importance of the event; <sup>* </sup>&nbsp;or 
extrinsically, on the consideration that it was generally known as a part of the 
evangelical tradition ; <sup>† </sup>&nbsp;John in particular supposed it to be known 
from Mark and Luke ; <sup>‡ </sup>&nbsp;or lastly, both Matthew and John omitted it 
as not belonging to the earthly life of Jesus, to the description of which their 
writings were exclusively devoted.<sup>§ </sup>&nbsp;But we must contend, on the 
contrary, that the life of Jesus, especially that enigmatical life which he led 
after his return from the grave, absolutely required such a close as the 
ascension. Whether it were generally known or not, whether it were important or 
unimportant, —the simple æsthetic interest which dictates even to an 
uncultivated author, that a narrative should be wound up with a conclusion, must 
have led every evangelical writer who knew of the ascension to mention it, 
though it were but summarily at the end of his history, in order to avoid the 
strange impression left by the first gospel and still more by the fourth, as 
narratives losing themselves in vague obscurity. Hence our apologists resort to 
the supposition that the first and fourth Evangelists held it impossible to give 
an account of the ascension of Jesus, because the eyewitnesses, however long 
they might gaze after him, could still only see him hovering in the air and 
encircled by the cloud, not entering heaven and taking his place on the right 
hand of God.<sup>|| &nbsp;</sup>But in the ideas of the ancient world, to which 
heaven was nearer than to us, an entrance into the clouds was in itself a real 
ascent into heaven, as we see from the stories of Romulus and Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thus it is undeniable that the above 
Evangelists were ignorant of the ascension : but the conclusion of the most 
recent criticism, that this ignorance is a reproach to the first Evangelist as a 
sign of his unapostolic character,<sup>¶ </sup>is the less in place here, 
because the event in question is rendered suspicious not merely by the silence 
of two Evangelists, but also by the want of agreement between those who narrate 
it. Mark is at variance with Luke, nay, Luke is at variance with himself. In the 
account of the former, it appears as if Jesus had ascended into heaven 
immediately from the meal in which he appeared to the eleven, consequently from 
out of a house in Jerusalem ; for the phrases: <i>he appeared with the eleven as 
they sat at meat, and upbraided them—and he said—So then after the Lord had

violence that a change of place or a distinction of time can be introduced.<sup>* 
&nbsp;</sup>Now an ascent into heaven directly out of a room is certainly not easy to 
imagine; hence Luke represents it as taking place in the open air. In his gospel 
he makes Jesus immediately before his ascension, lead out his disciples <i>as 
far as Bethany </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">ewV eiV 
Bhqanian</span><span lang="EN-US">, but in the Acts he places the scene on the

<span lang="EN-US">this, however, cannot be imputed to him as a contradiction, 
since Bethany lay in the neighbourhood of the mount of Olives.<sup>† </sup>&nbsp;But 
there is a more important divergency in his statement of time; for in his 
gospel, as in Mark, we are left to infer that the ascension took place on the 
same day with the resurrection: whereas in the Acts it is expressly remarked, 
that the two events were separated by an interval of forty days. It has already 
been remarked that the latter determination of time must have come to the 
knowledge of Luke in the interim between the composition of the gospel and that 
of the Acts. The more numerous the narratives of appearances of the risen Jesus, 
and the more various the places to which they were assigned: the less would the 
short space of a day suffice for his life on earth after the resurrection; while 
the determination of the lengthened period which had become necessary to forty 
days precisely, had its foundation in the part which this number is known to 
have played in the Jewish, and already in the Christian legend. The people of 
Israel were forty years in the wilderness; Moses was forty days on mount Sinai; 
he and Elias fasted forty days; and Jesus himself previous to the temptation 
remained the same length of time without nourishment in the wilderness. As, 
then, all these mysterious intermediate states and periods of transition were 
determined by the number forty: this number presented itself as especially 
appropriate for the determination of the mysterious interval between the 
resurrection and ascension of Jesus.<sup>‡ </sup></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;As regards the description of the event 
itself; it might be thought admissible to ascribe the silence of Mark, and of 
Luke in his gospel, concerning the cloud and the angels, purely to the brevity 
of their narratives; but since Luke at the close of his gospel narrates 
circumstantially enough the conduct of the disciples—how they fell down and 
worshipped the ascended Jesus, and returned to the city with great joy: so he 
would doubtless have pointed out the information communicated to them by angels 
as the immediate source of their joy, had he known anything of such a particular 
at the time when he com­posed his first writing. Hence this feature seems rather 
to have been gradually formed in tradition, in order to render due honour to 
this last point also in the life of Jesus, and to present a confirmation of the 
insufficient testimony of men as to his exaltation into heaven by the mouth of 
two heavenly wit­nesses.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;As, according to this, those who knew 
of an ascension of Jesus, had by no means the same idea of its particular 
circumstances: there must have been in general two different modes of conceiving 
the close of the life of Jesus; some regarding it as a visible ascension, others 
not so.<sup>* </sup>&nbsp;When Matthew makes Jesus before the tributial of the high 
priest predict his exaltation to the right hand of the divine power (xxvi. 64), 
and after his resurrection declare that now all power is given to him in heaven 
and earth (xxviii. 18); and nevertheless has nothing of a visible ascension, but 
on the contrary puts into the mouth of Jesus the assurance: <i>I am with you 
alway, even unto the end of the world, (v. </i>20): it is evident that the 
latent idea, on which his representation is founded, is that Jesus, doubtless 
immediately on his resurrection, ascended invisibly to the Father, though at the 
same time remaining invisibly with his followers; and that out of this 
concealment he, as often as he found it expedient, revealed himself in 
Christophanies. The same view is to be discerned in the Apostle Paul, when in i 
Cor. xv. he undistinguishingly places the appearance to himself of the Christ 
already ascended into heaven, in one series with the earlier Christophanies; and 
also the author of the fourth gospel and the rest of the New<i> </i>Testament 
writers only presuppose what must necessarily be presupposed according to the 
messianic passage: <i>Sit thou at my right hand, </i>Ps. cx. 1<i> : </i>that 
Jesus was exalted to the right hand of God; without deciding anything as to the 
manner of the exaltation, or representing to themselves the ascension as a 
visible one. The imagination of the primitive Christians must however have felt 
a strong temptation to depict this exaltation as a brilliant spectacle. When it 
was once concluded that the Messiah Jesus had arrived at so exalted a position, 
it would appear desirable to gaze after him, as it were, on his way thither. If 
it was expected, in accordance with the prophecy of Daniel, that his future 
return from heaven would be a visible descent in the clouds : this would 
naturally suggest that his departure to heaven should be represented as a 
visible ascent on a cloud; and when Luke makes the two white-apparelled angels, 
who joined the disciples after the removal of Jesus, say: <i>this same Jesus, 
who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have 
seen him go into heaven </i>(Acts 1. 11): we need only take the converse of this 
declaration in order to have before us the genesis of the conception of the 
ascension of Jesus; for the mode of conclusion was this: as Jesus will at some 
future time return from heaven in the clouds, so he must surely have departed 
thither <sup>† </sup>&nbsp;in the same manner.</span></p>

has in the translation of Enoch (Gen. v. 24; comp. Wis. xliv. 16, xlix. 16; Heb.

; comp. Wis. xlviii. 9 ; 1 Macc. ii. 58), together with the Grecian and Roman 
apotheoses of Hercules and Romulus, recede into the background. Apart from the 
question whether the latter were known to the second and third Evangelists; the 
statement relative to Enoch is too vague; while the chariot and horses of fire 
that transported Elijah were not adapted to the milder spirit of Christ. Instead 
of this the enveloping cloud and the removal while holding a farewell 
conversation, may appear to have been borrowed from the later representation of 
the removal of Moses, which however in other particulars has considerable 
divergencies from that of Jesus.<sup>* </sup>&nbsp;Perhaps also one trait in the 
narrative of the Acts may be explained out of the history of Elijah. When this 
prophet, before his translation, is entreated by his servant Elisha that he will 
bequeath him a double measure of his spirit: Elijah attaches to the concession 
of this boon the condition : <i>if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it 
shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so; </i>whence we might 
perhaps gather the reason why Luke (Acts i. 9) lays stress on the fact that the 
disciples beheld Jesus as he went up (</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Symbol">blepontwn 
autwn ephrqh</span><span lang="EN-US">):<i> </i>namely, because, according to 
the arrative concerning Elijah, this was necessary, if the disciples were to 
receive the spirit of their master.</span></p>

said of Moses: <i>And as he was going to embrace Eleazar and Joshua, and was 
still discoursing with them, a cloud stood over him on a sudden, and he 
disappeared in a certain valley, alhtough he wrote in the holy books that he 
died, which was done out of fear, lest they should venture to say that because 
of his extraordinary virtue, he went to God. </i>Philo, however, vita Mosis, 
opp. ed. Mangey, vol. ii. p. 179, makes the soul only of Moses ascend into 
heaven.</span></p>
