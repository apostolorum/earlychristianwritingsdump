<p ALIGN="center"><font size="4">MACHINATIONS OF THE ENEMIES OF JESUS; TREACHERY 
OF JUDAS; </font></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font size="4">LAST SUPPER WITH HIS DISCIPLES.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 117. DEVELOPMENT OF THE RELATION OF JESUS TO HIS ENEMIES.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the three first gospels the principal enemies of Jesus are 
the Pharisees and scribes,<sup>* </sup>who saw in him the most ruinous opponent 
of their institutions; together with the chief priests and elders, who, as the 
heads of the external temple-worship and the hierarchy founded upon it, could 
have no friendly feeling towards one who on every opportunity represented as the 
main point, the internal service of God with the devotion of the mind. Elsewhere 
we find among the enemies of Jesus the Sadducees (Matt. xvi. 1, xxii. 23 ff<i>.
</i>parall., comp. Matt. xvi. 6 ff. parall.), to whose materialism much in his 
opinions must have been repugnant; and the Herodian party (Mark iii. 6; Matt. 
xxii. 16 parall.) who, having been unfavourable to the Baptist, were naturally 
so to his successor. The fourth gospel, though it sometimes mentions the chief 
priests and Pharisees, the most frequently designates the enemies of Jesus by 
the general expression: <font FACE="Symbol">oi Ioudaioi </font><i>the Jews; </i>
an expression which proceeds from a later, Christian point of view.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The four Evangelists unanimously relate, that the more defined 
machinations of the Pharisaic-hierarchical party against Jesus, took their rise 
from an offence committed by the latter against the prevalent rules concerning 
the observation of the sabbath. When Jesus had cured the man with the withered 
hand, it is said in Matthew: <i>the Pharisees went out, and held a council 
against him, how they might destroy him </i>(xii. 14, comp. Mark iii. 6; Luke 
vi. 11); and in like manner John observes, on the occasion of the Sabbath cure 
at the pool of Bethesda: <i>therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, </i>and 
after mentioning a declaration of Jesus, proceeds thus: <i>therefore the Jews 
sought the more to kill him </i>(v. 16, 18).</p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Winer’s bibl. Realwörterb.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">676</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But immediately after this commencing point, the synoptical 
account of the relation in question diverges from that of John. In the 
synoptists, the next offence is given by the neglect of washing before meals on 
the part of Jesus and his disciples, with the sharp invectives which, when 
called to account on the subject, he launched forth against the spirit of petty 
observance, and the hypocrisy and spirit of persecution with which it was united 
in the Pharisees and lawyers; after all which it is said, that the latter 
conceived a deep animosity against him, and tried to sift him and entrap him by 
dangerous questions, in order to obtain grounds of accusation against him (Luke 
xi. 37—54, comp. Matt. xv. i ff.; Mark vii. i ff.). On his last journey to 
Jerusalem, the Pharisees gave Jesus a warning against Herod (Luke xiii. 3 which 
apparently had no other object than to induce him to leave the country. The next 
important cause of offence to the hierarchical party, was the striking homage 
paid to Jesus by the people on his entrance into Jerusalem, and the purification 
of the temple which he immediately undertook: but they were still withheld from 
any violent measures towards him by the strength of his interest with the people 
(Matt. xxi. 15 ff.; Mark ix. i8; Luke xix. 39, 47 f.), which was the sole reason 
why they did not possess themselves of his person, after the severe manner in 
which he had characterized them, in the parable of the husbandmen of the 
vineyard (Matt. xxi. 45 f. parall.). After these events, it scarcely needed the 
anti-Pharisaic discourse Matt. xxiii. to make the chief priests, the scribes and 
elders, <i>i.e. </i>the Sanhedrim, assemble in the palace of the high priest, 
shortly before the passover, for a consultation, <i>that they might take Jesus 
by subtlety and kill him </i>(Matt. xxvi. 3 ff. parall.).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the fourth gospel, also, the great number of the adherents of 
Jesus among the people is sometimes, it is true, described as the reason why<i>
</i>his enemies desired to seize him (vii. <i>32, </i>44, comp. iv. 1 ff.<i>),
</i>and his solemn entrance into Jerusalem embitters them here also (xii. 19) ; 
sometimes their murderous designs are mentioned without any motive being stated 
(vii. 1, 19, 25, viii. 40): but the main cause of offence in this gospel, lies 
in the declarations of Jesus concerning his exalted dignity Even on the occasion 
of the cure of the lame man on the Sabbath, what chiefly irritated the Jews was 
that Jesus justified it by appealing to the uninterrupted agency of God as his 
Father, which in their opinion was a blasphemous <i>making of himself equal with 
God, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ison eauton poiein tw qew </font><i>(v. </i>18); 
when he spoke of his divine mission, they sought to lay hold on him (vii. 30, 
comp. viii 20<i>) </i>on his asserting that he was before Abraham, they took up 
stones to cast at him (viii. <i>59); </i>they did the same when he declared that 
he and the Father were one (x. 31), and when he asserted that the Father was in 
him and he in the Father, they again attempted to seize him (x. 39). But that 
which, according to the fourth gospel, turns the scale, and causes the hostile 
party to take a formal resolution against Jesus, is the resuscitation </p>

<p ALIGN="center">677</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">of Lazarus. When this act was reported to the Pharisees, they 
and the chief priests convened a council of the Sanhedrim, in which the subject 
of deliberation was, that if Jesus continued to perform so many <i>signs, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">shmeia</font>, all would at length adhere to him, and then 
the Roman power would be exerted to the destruction of the Jewish nation; 
whereupon the high priest Caiaphas pronounced the momentous decision, that it 
was better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to 
perish. His death was now determined upon, and it was enjoined on every one to 
point out his abode, that he might be arrested (xi. 46 ff.).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With regard to this difference modern criticism observes, that 
we should not at all comprehend the tragical turn of the fate of Jesus from the 
synoptical accounts, and that John alone opens to us a glance into the manner in 
which, step by step, the breach between the hierarchical party and Jesus was 
widened; in short, that in this point also the representation of the fourth 
gospel shows itself a pragmatical one, which that of the other gospels is not.<sup>*
</sup>But what it is in which the Gospel of John exhibits superiority in 
gradation and progress, it is difficult to see, since the very first definite 
statement concerning the incipient enmity (v. 18) contains the extreme of the 
offence <i>(</i><font FACE="Symbol">ison eauton poiein tw qew</font><i>, making 
himself equal with God</i>)<i> </i>and the extreme of the enmity (<font FACE="Symbol">ezhtoun 
auton apokteinai</font>, <i>they sought to kill him:); </i>so that all which is 
narrated further concerning the hostility of the Jews is mere repetition, and 
the only fact which presents itself as a step towards more decided measures is 
the resolution of the Sanhedrim, chap. xi. This species of gradation, however, 
is not wanting in the synoptical account also: here we have the transition from 
the indefinite <i>laying wait </i>for Jesus, and the <i>communing what might be 
done to him </i>(Luke xi. 54, vi. ii), or as it is more precisely given in 
Matthew (xii. 14), and in Mark (iii. 6), the <i>taking counsel how </i>they <i>
might destroy him, </i>to the definite resolve as to the manner (<font FACE="Symbol">dolw)
</font>and the time (<font FACE="Symbol">mh en th eorth </font>Matt. xxvi. 4 f. 
parall.).—But it is especially made a reproach to three first Evangelists, that 
in passing over the resurrection of Lazarus, they have omitted that incident 
which gave the final impulse to the fate of Jesus.† If we, on the contrary, in 
virtue of the above result of our criticism of this miraculous narrative, must 
rather praise the synoptists, that they do not represent as the turning point in 
the fate of Jesus, an incident which never really happened : so the fourth 
Evangelist, by the manner in which he relates the murderous resolve to which it 
was the immediate inducement, by no means manifests himself as one whose 
authority can be held by us a sufficient warrant for the truth of his narrative. 
The circumstance that he ascribes to the high priest the gift of prophecy 
(without doubt in accordance with a superstitious idea of his age‡ ), and 
regards his </p>

<p ALIGN="center">678</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">speech as a prediction of the death of Jesus, would certainly 
not by itself prove that he could not have been an apostle and eye-witness.* But 
it has with justice been held a difliculty, that our Evangelist designates 
Caiaphas as the <i>high priest of that year, </i><font FACE="Symbol">arciereuV 
tou eniautou ekeinou </font>(xi. 49), and thus appears to suppose that this 
dignity, like many Roman magistracies, was an annual one; whereas it was 
originally held for life, and even in that period of Roman ascendancy, was not a 
regular annual office, but was transferred as often as it pleased the 
arbitrariness of the Romans. To conclude on the authority of the fourth gospel, 
in opposition to the general custom, and notwithstanding the silence of 
Josephus, that Annas and Caiaphas, by a private agreement, held the office for a 
year by turns,† is an expedient to which those may resort whom it pleases; to 
take <font FACE="Symbol">eniautou</font><i> </i>indefinitely for
<font FACE="Symbol">cronou</font>,‡ is, from the twofold repetition of the same 
expression, v.<i> </i>51 and xviii. 13, inadmissible; that at that period the 
high priesthood was frequently transferred from one to another, and some high 
priests were not allowed to remain in their office longer than a year,§ did not 
justify our author in designating Caiaphas as the high priest of a particular 
year, when in fact he filled that post for a series of years, and certainly 
throughout the duration of the public agency of Jesus; lastly, that John 
intended to say that Caiaphas was high priest in the year in which Jesus died, 
without thereby excluding earlier and later years, in which lie also held the 
office,|| is an equally untenable position. For if the time in which an incident 
occurs is described as a certain year, this mode of expression must imply, that 
either the incident the date of which is to be determined, or the fact by which 
that date is to be determined, is connected with the term of a year. Thus either 
the author of the fourth gospel must have been of the opinion, that from the 
death of Jesus, to which this decision of Caiaphas was the initiative step, a plenitude of spiritual gifts, including the gift of prophecy to 
the high priest of that period, was dispensed throughout that particular year,
<sup>¶</sup> and no longer; or, if this be a far-fetched explanation, he must 
have imagined that Caiaphas was high priest for the term of that year only. 
Lücke concludes that as, according to Josephus, the high priest of that period 
held his office for ten years successively, therefore John cannot have meant, by 
the expression <font FACE="Symbol">arciereuV tou eniautou ekeinou</font><i>, </i>
that the office of high priest was an annual one; whereas the author of the 
Probabilia, on the ground that the evidence of this meaning in the words of the 
gospel, is far more certain than that John is its author, reverses this 
proposition, and concludes, that as the fourth gospel here presents an idea 
concerning the duration of the office of high priest which could not be 
entertained in Palestine, therefore its author cannot have been a native of 
Palestine.* </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of the further statements also, as to the points in which Jesus 
gave offence to the hierarchy of his nation, those which the synoptists have 
alone, or in common with John, are credible; those which are peculiar to the 
latter, not so. Among those which are common to both sides, the solemn entrance 
of Jesus into Jerusalem, and the strong attachment of the people to him, were 
equally natural causes of offence with his discourses and actions in opposition 
to the sabbatical institutions, in whatever the latter may have consisted; on 
the contrary, the manner in which, according to the fourth gospel, the Jews take 
offence at the declarations of Jesus concerning himself as the Son of God, is, 
according to our earlier analysis,* as inconceivable, as it is consistent with 
the common order of things that the polemical tone towards the Pharisees which 
the first Evangelists all lend to Jesus, should irritate the party attacked. 
Thus no new or more profound insight into the causes and motives of the reaction 
against Jesus, is to be obtained from the fourth gospel: but the information 
which the synoptists have preserved to us fully suffices to make that fact 
intelligible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 118. JESUS AND HIS BETRAYER.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although it had been resolved in the council of the chief 
priests and elders, that the feast time should be allowed to pass over before 
any measures were taken against Jesus, because any act of violence against him 
in these days might easily excite an insurrection, on the part of his numerous 
adherents among the visitants to the feast (Matt. xxvi. 5; Mark xiv. 2<i>): </i>
yet this consideration was superseded by the facility with which one of his 
disciples offered to deliver him into their hands. Judas, surnamed
<font FACE="Symbol">IskariwthV</font>, doubtless on account of his origin from 
the Jewish city of Kerioth† (Josh. xv. 25),<i> </i>went, according to the 
synoptists, a few days before the passover, to the heads of the priesthood, and 
volunteered to deliver Jesus quietly into their hands, for which service they 
promised him money, according to Matthew, thirty pieces of silver (<font FACE="Symbol">arguria</font><i>,
</i>Matt. xxvi. 14 ff. parall.). Of such an antecedent transaction between Judas 
and the enemies of Jesus, the fourth gospel not only says nothing, but appears 
moreover to represent the matter as if Judas had not formed the determination of 
betraying Jesus to the priesthood, until the last Supper, and had then promptly 
put it into execution. The same entering (<font FACE="Symbol">eiselqein</font>)<i>
</i>of Satan into Judas, which Luke (xxii. 3) places before his first interview 
with the chief priests, and before any preparation had been made for Jesus and 
his disciples to eat </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">1* Vol</sup>. II. § 62.</p>
<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Olshausen gives us more precise information concerning 
the descent of the traitor, when he says (bibl. Comm. 2, s.<i> </i>458 Anm.): 
&quot;Perhaps the passage, Gen. xlix. 27, <i>Dan shall be a serpent, an adder in the 
path, that biteth the horse’s heels, so that his rider shall fall backward, </i>
is a prophetic intimation of the treachery of Judas, whence we might conclude 
that he was of the tribe of Dan.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="center">680</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">the passover together, is represented by the author of the 
fourth gospel as occurring at this meal, before Judas left the company (xiii. 
27):<i> </i>a proof, as it appears, that in the opinion of this Evangelist, 
Judas now made his first traitorous visit. He does indeed observe, before the 
meal (xiii. 2),<i> </i>that the <i>devil had put it into the heart </i>of Judas 
to betray Jesus, and this <font FACE="Symbol">tou diabolou beblhkotoV eiV thn 
kardian </font>is commonly regarded as the parallel of Luke’s
<font FACE="Symbol">eishlqe satanaV</font><i> (Satan entered </i>into him), 
being understood to imply the formation of the treacherous resolve, in 
consequence of which Judas went to the chief priests: but if he had previously 
been in treaty with them, the betrayal was already completed, and it is then not 
easy to perceive what can be meant by the words <font FACE="Symbol">eishlqen eiV 
auton o satanaV </font>on the occasion of the last meal, since the summoning of 
those who were to seize Jesus was no new diabolical resolution, but only the 
execution of that which had already been embraced. The expression in John v. 27 
only obtains an entirely consistent sense in distinction from v. 2,<i> </i>when 
the <font FACE="Symbol">ballein eiV thn kardian </font>in the latter, is 
understood of the rising of the thought, the <font FACE="Symbol">eiselqein
</font>in the former, of the ripening of this thought into resolution, the 
supposition that Judas had pledged himself to the chief priests before the meal 
being thus excluded.* In this manner, however, the statement of the synoptists 
that Judas, some time before the perpetration of his treacherous act, made a 
bargain with the enemies of Jesus, stands in contradiction with that of John, 
that he only put himself in league with them immediately before the deed; and 
here Liicke decides in favour of John, maintaining it to be after his departure 
from the last supper (xiii. 30), that Judas made that application to the chief 
priests which the synoptists (Matt. xxvi. 1 f. parall.) place before the meal.† 
But this decision of Lücke’s is founded solely on deference to the presupposed 
authority of John; for even if, as he remarks, Judas could very well obtain an 
interview with the priests when night had commenced: still, regarding the matter 
apart from any presuppositions, the probability is beyond comparison stronger on 
the side of the synoptists, who allow some time for the affair, than on that of 
John, according to whom it is altogether sudden, and Judas, truly as if he were 
possessed, rushes out when it is already night to treat with the priests, and 
immediately hurry to the deed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Concerning the motives which induced Judas to league himself 
with the enemies of Jesus, we learn from the three first gospels no more than 
that he received money from the chief priests. This would indicate that he was 
actuated by covetousness, especially according to the narrative in Matthew, 
where Judas, before he promises to betray Jesus, puts the question, <i>What will 
ye give me? </i>Clearer light is thrown on this subject by the statement of the 
fourth gospel (xii. 4 ff<i>.), </i>that on the occasion of the meal in Bethany, 
Judas was indignant at the anointing, as an unnecessary expenditure,—that he 
carried the purse, and acted the thief in that office; whence it might be 
supposed that the avarice of Judas, no longer satisfied by his peculations on 
the funds of the society, hoped to reap a more considerable harvest by</p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>That, according to the account in John, Judas first went 
to the chief priests from the meal, is acknowledged by Lightfoot also (horæ, p. 
465), but he on this account regards the meal described by John as earlier than 
the synoptical one.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">betraying Jesus to the rich and powerful sacerdotal party. We 
must hold ourselves under obligation to the author of the fourth gospel, that by 
the preservation of these particulars, which are wanting in the other 
Evangelists, he has made the act of Judas somewhat more comprehensible,—so soon 
as his statements are shown to have an historical foundation. We have shown 
above, however, how improbable it is that, had that censure really proceeded 
from Judas, the legend should have lost this trait;* how probable, On the other 
hand, a legendary origin of it, it is easy to discern. The meal at Bethany stood 
in the evangelical tradition near to the end of the life of Jesus, an end 
brought about by the treachery of Judas ;—how easily might the thought arise in 
some one, that the narrow-minded censure of a noble prodigality could only come 
from the covetous Judas? That the censure at the same time turned upon the 
propriety of selling the ointment for the benefit of the poor, could in the 
mouth of Judas be only a pretext, behind which he concealed his selfishness: but 
advantage to himself from the sale of the ointment could not be expected by him, 
unless he allowed himself to purloin some of the money saved; and this again he 
could not do unless he were the purse-bearer. If it thus appear possible for the 
statement that Judas was a <i>thief and had the bag, </i>to have had an 
unhistorical origin: we have next to inquire whether there are any reasons for 
supposing that such was actually the<i> </i>case.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here we must take into consideration another point on which the 
synoptists and John differ, namely, the foreknowledge of Jesus that Judas would 
betray him. In the synoptical gospels, Jesus first manifests this knowledge at 
the last supper, consequently at a time in which the deed of Judas had virtually 
been perpetrated; and apparently but a short time before, Jesus had so little 
presentiment that one of the twelve would be lost to him, that he promised them 
all, without exception, the honour of sitting on twelve thrones of judgment in 
the palingenesia (Matt. xix. 28)<i>. </i>According to John, on the contrary, 
Jesus declares shortly before the time of the last passover but one, 
consequently a year before the result, that one of the twelve is a <i>devil, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">diaboloV</font>, meaning, according to the observation of 
the Evangelist, Judas, as his future betrayer (vi. 70); for, as it had been 
observed shortly before (v. 64), <i>Jesus knew from the beginning,—-who should 
betray him. </i>According to this, Jesus knew from the commencement of his 
acquaintance with Judas, that this disciple would prove a traitor; and not 
merely did he foresee this external issue, but also, since he knew what was in 
man (John ii. 25)<i>, </i>he must have penetrated the motives of Judas, namely,
</p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Vol. II. § 89.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">682</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">covetousness and love of money. And, if so, would he have made 
him purse-bearer, i.e. placed him in a position in which his propensity to seek 
gain by any means, even though dishonest, must have had the most abundant 
nourishment? Would he have made him a thief by giving him opportunity, and thus, 
as if designedly, have brought up in him a betrayer for himself? Considered 
simply in an economical point of view, who entrusts a purse to one of whom he 
knows that he robs it? Then, in relation to the idea of Jesus as a moral 
teacher, who places the weak in a situation which so constantly appeals to his 
weak point, as to render it certain that he will sooner or later give way to the 
temptation? No truly: Jesus assuredly did not so play with the souls immediately 
entrusted to him, did not exhibit to them so completely the opposite of what he 
taught them to pray for, <i>lead us not into temptation </i>(Matt. vi. 13), as 
to have made Judas, of whom he foreknew that he would become his betrayer out of 
covetousness, the purse-bearer of his society; or, if he gave him this office, 
he cannot have had such a foreknowledge.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In order to arrive at a decision in this alternative, we must 
consider that foreknowledge separately, and inquire whether, apart from the 
treasurership of Judas, it be probable or not? We shall not enter on the 
question of the psychological possibility, because there is always freedom of 
appeal to the divine nature of Jesus; but with regard to the moral possibility 
it is to be asked, whether presupposing that foreknowledge, it be justifiable in 
Jesus to have chosen Judas among the twelve, and to have retained him within 
this circle? As it was only by this vocation that his treachery as such could be 
rendered possible; so Jesus appears, if he foresaw this treachery, to have 
designedly drawn him into the sin. It is urged that intercourse with Jesus 
afforded Judas the possibility of escaping that abyss :* but Jesus is supposed 
to have foreseen that this possibility would not be realized. It is further said 
that even in other circles the evil implanted in Judas would not the less have 
developed itself in a different form: a proposition which has a strong tinge of 
fatalism. Again, when it is said to be of no avail to a man that the evil, the 
germ of which lies within him, should not be developed, this appears to lead to 
consequences which are repudiated by the apostle Paul, Rom. iii. 8, vi.1 f. And 
regarding the subject in relation to feeling merely,—how could Jesus endure to 
have a man, of whom he knew that he would be his betrayer, and that all 
instruction would be fruitless to him, as his constant attendant throughout the 
whole period of his public life? Must not the presence of such a person have 
every hour interfered with his confidential intercourse with the rest of the 
twelve? Assuredly they must have been weighty motives, for the sake of which 
Jesus imposed on himself anything so repugnant and difficult. Such motives or 
objects must either have had relation to Judas, and thus have consisted in the 
design to make him better—which however was </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">precluded by the decided foreknowledge of his crime; or they 
must have had relation to Jesus himself and his work, i.e. Jesus had the 
conviction that if the work of redemption by means of his death were to be 
effected, there must be one to betray him.* But for the purpose of redemption, 
according to the Christian theory, the death of Jesus was the only indispensable 
means: whether this should be brought about by a betrayal, or in any other way, 
was of no moment, and that the enemies of Jesus must, earlier or later, have 
succeeded in getting him into their power without the aid of Judas, is 
undeniable. That the betrayer was indispensable in order to bring about the 
death of Jesus exactly at the passover, which was a type of himself † —with such 
trivialities it will scarcely be attempted to put us off in these days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If then we are unable to discover any adequate motive which 
could induce Jesus advertently to receive and retain in his society his betrayer 
in the person of Judas: it appears decided that he cannot beforehand have known 
him to be such. Schleiermacher, in order that he may not infringe on the 
authority of John by denying this foreknowledge, prefers doubting that Jesus 
chose the twelve purely by his own act, and supposes that this circle was rather 
formed by the voluntary adherence of the disciples: since it would be more easy 
to justify the conduct of Jesus, if he merely refrained from rejecting Judas 
when he spontaneously offered himself than if he drew him to himself by free 
choice.‡ But hereby the authority of John is still endangered, for it is he who 
makes Jesus say to the twelve: <i>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you
</i>(xv. 16, comp. vi. 76); moreover, even dismissing the idea of a decided act 
of election, still for any one to remain constantly with Jesus there needed his 
permission and sanction, and even these he could not, acting humanly, give to a 
man of whom he knew that, by means of this relation to himself, he would be 
enabled to mature the blackest crime. It is said, however, that Jesus put 
himself entirely into the Divine point of view, and admitted Judas into his 
society, for the sake of the possibility of reformation which he yet foreknew 
would never be realised; but this would be a Divine inhumanity,—not the conduct 
of the God-man. If, according to this, it is extremely difficult to maintain as 
historical the statement of the fourth gospel, that Jesus from the beginning 
knew Judas to be his betrayer: so it is equally easy to discern what even 
without historical foundation might lead to such a representation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It would be natural to suppose, that the fact of Jesus being 
betrayed by one of his own disciples, would be injurious to him in the eyes of 
his enemies, even if<i> </i>we did not know that Celsus, in the character of a 
Jew, reproached Jesus <i>that he was betrayed by one of those whom he called his 
disciples, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oti uf</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">wn wnomaze</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">maqhtwn proudoqh</font><i>, </i>as a proof that he was less 
able to attach his followers </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">to himself than every robber-chief.* Now as the injurious 
consequences to be drawn from the ignominious death of Jestis, appeared to be 
most completely obviated by the assertion that he had long foreknown his death: 
so, the arguments against Jesus derived from the treachery of Judas, might seem 
to be most effectually repelled by the statement, that he had penetrated into 
the character of the traitor from the first, and could have escaped what his 
treason prepared for him ; since this would involve the inference that he had 
exposed himself to the effects of his faithlessness by his own free will, and 
out of higher considerations.† This method included a second advantage, which 
attaches to the enunciator of every prediction alleged to be fulfilled, and 
which the fourth Evangelist naïvely makes his Jesus express, when, after the 
exposure of the betrayer, he puts into his mouth the words : <i>Now I tell you 
before it come, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he </i>
(xiii. 19)—In fact, the best motto for every <i>vaticinium post eventum. </i>
These two objects were the more completely attained, the earlier the period in 
the life of Jesus to which this foreknowledge was referred; whence it is to be 
explained why the author of the fourth gospel, not satisfied with the ordinary 
representation, that Jesus predicted his betrayal by Judas at the last supper, 
placed his knowledge on this subject in the commencement of the connexion 
between him and Judas.‡ </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This early knowledge on the part of Jesus concerning the 
treachery of Judas being dismissed as unhistorical, there would be room for the 
statement that Judas carried the purse of the society; since this particular 
only appeared incompatible with the above foreknowledge, while, if Jesus was in 
general mistaken in Judas, he might, under this error, have entrusted the funds 
to him. But by the proof that the representation of John, in relation to the 
knowledge of Jesus concerning his betrayer, is a fictitious one, its credibility 
in this matter is so shaken, that no confidence can be placed in the other 
statement. If the author of the fourth gospel has embellished the relation 
between Jesus and Judas on the side connected with Jesus, he can scarcely have 
left the side of Judas unadorned; if he has introduced the fact, that Jesus <i>
was betrayed, </i>by making Jesus foresee this part of his destiny, his other 
statement, that Judas had beforehand exhibited his avarice by a dishonest use of 
the common purse, may easily be only an introduction to the fact, that Jesus was 
betrayed <i>by Judas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But even though we renounce the information given by John 
concerning the character and motives of Judas: we still retain, in the 
forementioned statement of the synoptists, the most decided intimation that the 
chief motive of his deed was covetousness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 119<i>. </i>DIFFERENT OPINIONS CONCERNING THE CHARACTER OF 
JUDAS, AND THE MOTIVES OF HIS TREACHERY.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From the earliest to the latest times there have been persons, 
who have held opinions at issue with this view of the New Testament writers 
concerning the motives of Judas, and with their entirely reprobatory judgment 
upon them (comp. Acts i. 16 ff.);<i> </i>and this divergency has arisen partly 
out of au exaggerated supranaturalism, and partly out of a rationalistic bias.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An over-strained supranaturalism, proceeding from the point of 
view presented in the New Testament itself, namely, that the death of Jesus, 
decreed in the Divine plan of the world for the salvation of mankind, might even 
regard Judas, by whose treachery the death of Jesus was brought about, as a 
blameless instrument in the hand of Providence, a co-operator in the redemption 
of mankind. He might be placed in this light by the supposition that he had 
knowledge of that Divine decree, and that its fulfilment was the object at which 
he aimed in betraying Jesus. We actually find this mode of viewing the subject 
on the part of the gnostic sect of the Cainites, who, according to the ancient 
writers on heresies, held that Judas had liberated himself from the narrow 
Jewish opinions of the other disciples and attained to the gnosis, and 
accordingly betrayed Jesus because he knew that by his death the kingdom of the 
inferior spirits who ruled the world would be overthrown.* Others in the early 
church admitted that Judas betrayed Jesus out of covetousness; maintaining, 
however, that be did not anticipate the death of Jesus as a consequence of his 
betrayal, hut supposed that he would, as he had often previously done, escape 
from his enemies by an exertion of his supernatural power :<sup>† </sup>an 
opinion which forms the transition to the modern methods of justifying the 
traitor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the above mentioned supranaturalistic exaltation of Judas by 
the Cainites immediately proceeded from their antagonistic position with respect 
to Judaism, in virtue of which they had made it a principle to honour all who 
were blamed by the Jewish authors </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">of the Old Testament, and the judaizing authors of the New, and 
vice versa: so Rationalism especially in its first indignation at the long 
subjection of the reason to the fetters of authority, felt a certain delight 
both in divesting of their nimbus those biblical personages who according to its 
views had been too zealously deified by orthodoxy, and also in defending and 
elevating those who were condemned or depreciated by the latter. Hence, in the 
Old Testament, the exaltation of Esau over Jacob, of Saul over Samuel; in the 
New, of Martha over Mary, the eulogiums on the doubting Thomas, and now the 
apology even for the traitor Judas. According to some, he became a criminal out 
of injured honour: the manner in which Jesus reproved him at the meal at 
Bethany, and, in general, the inferior degree of regard which he experienced in 
comparison with other disciples, converted his love for his teacher into hatred 
and revenge.* Others have preferred the conjecture preserved by Theophylact, 
that Judas may have hoped to see Jesus this time also escape from his enemies. 
Some have taken up this idea in the supranaturalistic sense, supposing it to be 
the expectation of Judas that Jesus would set himself at liberty by an exertion 
of his miraculous power ;† others consistently with their point of view have 
supposed that Judas may probably have expected that if Jesus were taken prisoner 
the people would raise an insurrection in his favour and set him at liberty.‡ 
These opinions represent Judas as one who, in common with the other disciples, 
conceived the messianic kingdom as an earthly and political one, and hence was 
discontented that Jesus so long abstained from availing himself of the popular 
favour, in order to assume the character of the messianic ruler. Instigated 
either by attempts at bribery on the part of the Sanhedrim, or by the humour of 
their plan to seize Jesus in secret after the feast, Judas sought to forestall 
this project, which must have been fatal to Jesus, and to bring about his arrest 
before the expiration of the feast time, in which he might certainly hope to see 
Jesus liberated by an insurrection, by which means he would be compelled at last 
to throw himself into the arms of the people, and thus take the decisive step 
towards the establishment of his dominion. When he heard Jesus speak of the 
necessity of his being captured, and of his rising again in three clays, he 
understood these expressions as an intimation of the concurrence of Jesus in his 
plan; under this mistake, he partly failed to hear, and partly misinterpreted, 
his additional admonitory discourse; and especially understood the words: <i>
What thou doest, do quickly, </i>as an actual encouragement to the execution of 
his design. He took the thirty pieces of silver from the priests either to 
conceal his real intentions under the appearance of covetousness, and thus to 
lull every suspicion on their part; or, because, while he </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">expected an exaltation to one of the first places in the kingdom 
of his master, he was not unwilling to combine with it even that small 
advantage. But Judas had miscalculated in two points: first, in not considering 
that after the feasting of the paschal night, the people would not be early on 
the alert for an insurrection; secondly, in overlooking the probability, that 
the Sanhedrim would hasten to deliver Jesus into the hands of the Romans, from 
whom a popular insurrection would hardly suffice to deliver him. Thus Judas is 
supposed to be either an honest man misunderstood,* or a deluded one, who 
however was of no common character, but exhibited even in his despair the wreck 
of apostolic greatness;<sup>† </sup>or, he is supposed, by evil means, indeed, 
to have sought the attainment of an object, which was nevertheless good.‡ 
Neander imagines the two opposite opinions concerning Jesus, the supernatural 
and the natural, to have presented themselves to the mind of Judas in the form 
of a dilemma, so that he reasoned thus: if Jesus is the Messiah, a delivery into 
the hands of his enemies will, owing to his supernatural power, in no way injure 
him, but will, on the contrary, serve to accelerate his glorification: if, on 
the other hand, he is not the Messiah, he deserves destruction. According to 
this, the betrayal was merely a test, by which the doubting disciple meant to 
try the messiahsliip of his master.§ </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among these views, that which derives the treachery of Judas 
from wounded ambition, is the only one which can adduce a positive indication in 
its favour: namely, the repulse which the traitor drew on himself from Jesus at 
the meal in Bethany. But against such an appeal to this reproof we have already, 
on another occasion, applied the remark of the most recent criticism, that its 
mildness, especially as compared with the far more severe rebuke administered to 
Peter, Matt. xvi. 23<i>, </i>must forbid our attributing to it such an effect as 
the rancour which it is supposed to have engendered in Judas<sup>||</sup> while 
that in other instances he was less considered than his fellow-disciples, we 
have nowhere any trace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All the other conjectures as to what was properly the motive of 
the deed of Judas, can only be supported by negative grounds, i.e. grounds which 
make it improbable in general that his project had a bad aim, and in particular, 
that his motive was covetousness; a positive proof; that he intended to further 
the work of Jesus, and especially that he was actuated by violent political 
views of the Messiah’s kingdom, is not to be discovered.—That Judas had in 
general no evil designs against Jesus is argued chiefly from the fact, that 
after the delivery of Jesus to the Romans, and the inevitableness of his death 
had come to his knowledge, he fell into despair; this being regarded as a proof 
that he had expected an opposite result. But not only does the unfortunate 
result of crime, as Paulus thinks, but also its fortunate result, that is, its 
success, &quot;exhibit </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">that which had before been veiled under a thousand extenuating 
pretexts, in all the blackness of its real form.&quot; Crime once become real, once 
passed into act, throws off the mask which it might wear while it remained 
merely ideal, and existed in thought alone; hence, as little as the repentance 
of many a murderer, when he sees his victim lie before him, proves that he did 
not really intend to commit the murder; so little can the anguish of Judas, when 
he saw Jesus beyond rescue, prove that he had not beforehand contemplated the 
death of Jesus as the issue of his deed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, it is further said, covetousness cannot have been the 
motive of Judas; for if gain had been his object, he could not be blind to the 
fact that the continued charge of the purse in the society of Jesus, would yield 
him more than the miserable thirty pieces of silver (from 20 to 25<i> </i>
thalers,* of our money), a sum which among the Jews formed the compensation for 
a wounded slave, being four months’ wages. But these thirty pieces of silver are 
in vain sought for in any other narrator than Matthew. John is entirely silent 
as to any reward offered to Judas by the priests; Mark and Luke speak 
indefinitely of <i>money </i><font FACE="Symbol">argurion</font><i>, </i>which 
they had promised him; and Peter in the Acts (i. 18) merely mentions a <i>
reward, </i><font FACE="Symbol">misqoV</font><i>, </i>which Judas obtained. 
Matthew, however, who alone has that definite sum, leaves us at the same time in 
no doubt as to the historical value of his statement. After relating the end of 
Judas (xxvii. 9 f.),<i> </i>he cites a passage from Zechariah (xi. 12<i> </i>f. 
; he ascribes it by mistake to Jeremiah), wherein likewise thirty pieces of 
silver appear as a price at which some one is valued. It is true that in the 
prophetic passage the thirty pieces of silver are not given as purchase money, 
but as hire; he to whom they are paid is the prophet, the representative of 
Jehovah, and the smallness of the sum is an emblem of the slight value which the 
Jews set upon the divine benefits so plentifully bestowed on them.<sup>† </sup>
But how easily might this passage, where there was mention of a shamefully low 
price (ironically a <i>good1y price </i>[<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>’eder hayqar</b>), 
at which the Israelites had rated the speaker in the prophecy, remind a 
Christian reader of his Messiah, who, in any case, had been sold for a paltry 
price compared with his value, and hence be led to determine by this passage, 
the price which was paid to Judas for betraying Jesus.‡ Thus the <i>thirty 
pieces of silver, </i><font FACE="Symbol">triakonta arguria</font><i>, </i>
present no support to those who would prove that it could not be the reward 
which made Judas a traitor; for they leave us as ignorant as ever how great or 
how small was the reward which Judas received. Neither can we, with Neander, 
conclude that the sum was trifling from Matt. xxvii. 6 ff. ; Acts i. 18, where 
it is said that a <i>field, </i><font FACE="Symbol">agroV </font>or
<font FACE="Symbol">cwrion</font><i>, </i>was purchased with the reward assigned 
to the treachery of Judas; since, even apart from the historical value of that

a smaller piece of land, and the additional observations of Matthew, that it was 
destined <i>to bury strangers in, </i><font FACE="Symbol">eiV tafhn toiV xenoiV
</font>will not allow us to think of a very small extent. How the same 
theologian can discover in the statement of the two intermediate Evangelists, 
that the Jewish rulers had promised Judas <i>money, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
argurion</font><i>, </i>an intimation that the sum was small, it is impossible 
to conceive.—Far more weighty is the observation above made with a different 
aim, that Jesus would scarcely have appointed and retained as purse-bearer one 
whom he knew to be covetous even to dishonesty; whence Neander directly infers 
that the fourth Evangelist, when he derived the remark of Judas at the meal in 
Bethany from his covetousness, put a false construction upon it, in consequence 
of the idea which ultimately prevailed respecting Judas, and especially added 
the accusation, that Judas robbed the common fund, out of his own imagination.* 
But in opposition to this it is to be asked, whether in Neander’s point of view 
it be admissible to impute to the apostle John, who is here understood to be the 
author of the fourth gospel, so groundless a calumny—for such it would be 
according to Neander’s supposition; and, in our point of view, it would at least 
be more natural to conclude, that Jesus indeed knew Judas to be fond of money, 
but did not until the last believe him to be dishonest, and hence did not 
consider him unfit for the post in question. Neander observes in conclusion: if 
Judas could be induced by money to betray Jesus, he must have long lost all true 
faith in him. This indeed follows of necessity, and must be supposed in every 
view of the subject; but this extinction of faith could of itself only lead him 
to <i>go back, </i><font FACE="Symbol">apelqein eiV ta opisw </font>(John vi. 
66); in order to prompt him to meditate treachery there must be a further, 
special incitement, which, intrinsically, might just as well be covetousness, as 
the views which are attributed to him by Neander and others.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That covetousness, considered as such an immediate motive, 
suffices to explain the deed of Judas, I will not maintain; I only contend that 
any other motives are neither stated nor anywhere intimated in the gospels, and 
that consequently every hypothesis as to their existence is built on the air.†

might partake of the passover with them, and to make the further arrangements 
(Matt. xxvi. 17 ff. parall.). The three narrators do not altogether agree as to

by Matthew, namely as a <i>large upper room, </i>which was already <i>furnished 
and prepared </i>for the reception of guests; and secondly, the manner in which 
they were to find the owner, is described by the former otherwise than by the 
latter. Matthew makes Jesus merely say to the disciples, that they were to go <i>
to such a man, </i><font FACE="Symbol">proV ton deina</font><i>: </i>the others, 
that, being come into the city, they would meet a man <i>bearing a pitcher of 
water, </i>whom they were to follow into the house which he should enter, and 
there make their application to the owner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this narrative there have been found a multitude of 
difficulties, which Gabler has assembled in a special treatise.<sup>* </sup>At 
the very threshold of the narrative it occasions surprise, that Jesus should not 
have thought of any preparation for the passover until the last day, nay, that 
he should even then have needed to be reminded of it by the disciples, as the 
two first Evangelists tell us: for owing to the great influx of people at the 
time of the passover (2,700,000, according to Josephus),† the accommodations in 
the city were soon disposed of, and the majority of the strangers were obliged 
to encamp in tents before the city. It is the more remarkable, then, that, 
notwithstanding all this the messengers of Jesus find the desired chamber 
disengaged, and not only so, but actually kept in reserve by the owner and 
prepared for a repast, as if he had had a presentiment that it would be bespoken 
by Jesus. And so confidently is this reckoned on by Jesus that he directs his 
disciples to ask the owner of the house,—not <i>whether </i>he can obtain from 
him a room in which to eat the passover, but merely—<i>where</i> the 
guest-chamber appropriated to this purpose may be? or, if we take Matthew’s 
account, he directs them to say to him that he will eat the passover at his 
house; to which it must be added that, according to Mark and Luke, Jesus even 
knows what kind of chamber will be assigned him, and in what part of the house 
it is situated. But the way in which, according to these two Evangelists, the 
two disciples were to find their way to the right house, is especially 
remarkable. The words <font FACE="Symbol">upagete eiV thn polin proV ton deina
</font>in Matthew (v. 18), sound as if Jesus had named the person to whom the 
disciples were to go, but that the narrator either would not or could not repeat 
it: whereas in the two other Evangelists, Jesus indicates the house into which 
they were to enter, by means of a person whom they would meet </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">carrying a vessel of water. Now how could Jesus in Bethany, or 
wherever else he might be, foreknow this accidental circumstance, unless, 
indeed, it had been pre-concerted that at this particular time a servant from 
the house should appear with a vessel of water, and thus await the messengers of 
Jesus? To the rationalistic expositors everything in our narrative appeared to 
point to a preconcerted arrangement; and this being presupposed, they believed 
that all its difficulties would at once be solved. The disciples, dispatched so 
late, could only find a room disengaged if it had been previously bespoken by 
Jesus; he could only direct them to address the owner of the house so 
categorically, if he had already previously made an arrangement with him; this 
would explain the precise knowledge of Jesus as to the locality, and, lastly, 
(the point from which this explanation sets out), his certainty that the 
disciples would meet a man carrying water from that particular house. This 
circumlocutory manner of indicating the house, which might have been avoided by 
the simple mention of the owner’s name, is supposed to have been adopted by 
Jesus, that the place where he intended to keep the passover might not be known 
before the time to the betrayer, who would otherwise perhaps have surprised him 
there, and thus have disturbed the repast.* </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But such is not at all the impression produced by the 
evangelical narrative. Of a preconcerted arrangement, of a previous bespeaking 
of the apartment, it says nothing; on the contrary, the words, <i>they found as 
he had said unto them, </i>in Mark and Luke, seem intended to convey the idea 
that Jesus was able to predict everything as they afterwards actually found it; 
a solicitous foresight is nowhere indicated, but rather a miraculous 
foreknowledge. Here, in fact, as above in the procuring of the animal for the 
entrance into Jerusalem, we have a twofold miracle: first, the fact that 
everything stands ready to supply the wants of Jesus, and that no one is able to 
withstand the power of his name; secondly, the ability of Jesus to take 
cognizance of distant circumstances, and to predict the merest fortuities.† It 
must create surprise that, forcibly as this supranaturalistic conception of the 
narrative before us urges itself upon the reader, Olshausen himself seeks to 
elude it, by arguments which would nullify most of the histories of miracles, 
and which we are accustomed to hear only from rationalists. To the impartial 
expositor, he says,‡ the narrative does not present the slightest warrant for a 
miraculous interpretation (we almost fancy ourselves transported into the 
commentary of Paulus); if the narrators intended to recount a miracle, they must 
have expressly observed that no previous arrangement had been made (precisely

<p ALIGN="LEFT">rationalistic demand—if a cure were meant to be recognised as a 
miracle, the application of natural means must have been expressly denied); 
moreover the object of such a miracle is not to be discerned, a strengthening of 
the faith of the disciples was not then necessary, nor was it to be effected by 
this unimportant miracle, after the more exalted ones which had preceded it :— 
grounds on which the thoroughly similar narrative of the procuring of the ass 
for the entrance, which Olshausen upholds as a miracle, would be equally 
excluded from the sphere of the supernatural.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The present narrative, indeed, is so strikingly allied to the 
earlier one just mentioned, that in relation to their historical reality, the 
same judgment must be passed on both. In the one as in the other, Jesus has a 
want, the speedy supply of which is so cared for by God, that Jesus foreknows to 
the minutest particular the manner in which it is to be supplied; in the one he 
needs a guest chamber, as in the other an animal on which to ride; in the one as 
in the other, he sends out two disciples, to bespeak the thing required; in the 
one he gives them as a sign by which to find the right house—a man carrying 
water whom they are to meet, as in the other they have a sign in the 
circumstance of the ass being tied where two roads meet; in the one as in the 
other, he directs his disciples simply to mention him to the owner, in the one 
case as the <i>master, </i><font FACE="Symbol">didaskaloV</font>, in the other, 
as the <i>lord, </i><font FACE="Symbol">kurioV</font><i>, </i>in order to ensure 
unhesitating compliance with his demand; in both instances the result closely 
corresponds to his prediction. In the narrative more immediately under our 
consideration, as in the earlier one, there is wanting an adequate object, for 
the sake of which so manifold a miracle should have been ordained; while the 
motive which might occasion the development of the miraculous narrative in the 
primitive Christian legend is obvious. An Old Testament narrative, to which we 
have already had occasion to refer in connexion with the earlier miracle, is 
still more strikingly recalled by the one before us. After disclosing to Saul 
that he was destined to be King of Israel, Samuel, as a sign of the truth of 
this more remote announcement, foretells whom Saul will meet on his return 
homewards: namely, first two men with the information that his father’s asses 
are found; then three others, who will be carrying animals for sacrifice, bread 
and wine, and will offer him some of the bread, etc. (I Sam. x. 1 ff.): whence 
we see by what kind of predictions the Hebrew legend made its prophets attest 
their inspiration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As regards the relation of the gospels to each other, the 
narrative of Matthew is commonly placed far below that of the two other 
synoptists, and regarded as the later and more traditional.* The circumstance of 
the man carrying water, especially, is held to have belonged to the original 
fact, but to have been lost in tradition before the narrative reached Matthew, 
who inserted in its place the </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">enigmatical <font FACE="Symbol">upagete proV ton deina</font>,
<i>go to such a man. </i>But we have seen, on the contrary, that the
<font FACE="Symbol">deina</font><i> </i>presents no difficulty; while the 
circumstance of the water-bearer is in the highest degree enigmatical.* Still 
less is the omission of Matthew to designate the two commissioned disciples as 
Peter and John, an indication that the narrative of the third gospel is the more 
original one. For when Schleierrnacher says that this trait might easily be lost 
in the course of transmission through several hands, but that it could scarcely 
have been added by a later hand,—the latter half of his proposition, at least, 
is without foundation. There is little probability that Jesus should have 
assigned so purely economical an office to the two most eminent disciples; 
whereas it is easy to conceive that in the first instance it was simply 
narrated, as by Matthew, that Jesus sent <i>the disciples </i>or <i>some 
disciples, </i>that hereupon the number was fixed at <i>two, </i>perhaps from 
the narrative of the procuring of the ass, and that at length, as the 
appointment had relation to a task which was ultimately of high importance,—the 
preparing of the last meal of Jesus,—these places were filled by the two chief 
apostles, so that in this instance even Mark appears to have kept nearer to the 
original fact, since he has not adopted into his narrative the names of the two 
disciples, which are presented by Luke.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 121. DIVERGENT STATEMENTS RESPECTING THE TIME OF THE LAST 
SUPPER.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only does the fourth Evangelist omit all mention of the 
above arrangements for the paschal meal; he also widely diverges from the 
synoptists in relation to the meal itself. Independently of the difference which 
runs throughout the description of the scene, and which can only be hereafter 
considered, he appears, in regard to the time of the meal, to represent it as 
occurring before the passover, as decidedly as it is represented by the 
synoptists to be the paschal meal itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When we read in the latter, that the day on which the disciples 
were directed by Jesus to prepare for the meal, was already <i>the first day of 
unleavened bread,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">h prwth twn azumwn</font><i> when the 
passover must be killed, </i><font FACE="Symbol">en h edei quesqai</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">to pasca </font>(Matt. xxvi. 17 parall.): we cannot suppose 
the meal in question to have been any other than the paschal; further, when the 
disciples ask Jesus, <i>Where will thou that we prepare for thee to eat the 
passover? </i><font FACE="Symbol">pou qeleiV etoimaswmen soi fagein</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">to pasca</font>; when it is hereupon said of the disciples, 
that they <i>made ready the passover, </i><font FACE="Symbol">htoimasan to pasca
</font>(Matt. V. 19 parall.), and of Jesus, that <i>when evening was come, he 
sat down with the twelve, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oyiaV genomenhV anekeito
</font>&#61472;<font FACE="Symbol">meta twn dwdeka </font>(v. 20): the meal to which 
they here sat down appears to be marked </p>

<p ALIGN="center">694</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">out even to the superfluity as the paschal, even if Luke (xxii. 
15) did not make Jesus open the repast with the words: <i>With desire I have 
desired to eat this passover with you,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">epiqumia 
epequmhsa touto to pasca fagein meq</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">umwn</font>.—When, 
on the other hand, the fourth gospel commences its narrative of the last meal 
with the statement of time: <i>before the feast of the passover, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">pro de thV eorthV tou pasca</font>, (xiii. 1); the <i>
supper. </i><font FACE="Symbol">deip</font>vov, which is mentioned immediately 
after (v. <i>2), </i>appears also to happen before the passover; especially as 
throughout John’s description of this evening, which, especially in relation to 
the discourses accompanying the meal, is very ample, there is not any notice or 
even allusion, to indicate that Jesus was on this occasion celebrating the 
passover. Further, when Jesus after the meal addresses the traitor with the 
summons, <i>what thou doest, do quickly, </i>this is misunderstood by the rest 
of the disciples to mean, <i>Buy those things that we have need of against the 
feast, </i><font FACE="Symbol">eiV thn eorthn</font> (v. 29). Now the 
requirements for the feast related chiefly to the paschal meal, and consequently 
the meal just concluded cannot have been the paschal. Again, it is said, xviii. 
28, that on the following morning, the Jews would not enter the Gentile 
prætorium, <i>lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the passover,
</i><font FACE="Symbol">ina mh mianqwsin, all</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">ina 
fagwsi to pasca</font><i>: </i>whence it would seem that the paschal meal was 
yet in prospect. To this it may be added that this same succeeding day, on which 
Jesus was crucified, is called the <i>preparation of the passover, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">paraskeuh tou pasca</font>, i.e. the day on the evening of 
which the paschal lamb was to be eaten; moreover, when it is said of the second 
day after the meal in question, being that which Jesus passed in the grave: <i>
that sabbath day was an high day, </i><font FACE="Symbol">hn gar megalh h hmera 
ekeinou tou sabbatou </font>(xix. 31); this peculiar solemnity appears to have 
proceeded from the circumstance, that on that sabbath fell the first day of the 
passover, so that the paschal lamb was not eaten on the evening on which Jesus 
was arrested, but on the evening of his burial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These divergencies are so important, that many expositors, in 
order to prevent the Evangelists from falling into contradiction with each 
other, have here also tried the old expedient of supposing that they do not 
speak of the same thing—that John intends to describe an altogether different 
repast from</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">that of the synoptists. According to this view, the
<font FACE="Symbol">deipnon</font><i> </i>of John was an ordinary evening meal, 
doubtless in Bethany; on this occasion Jesus washed the disciples’ feet, spoke 
of the betrayer, and after Judas had left the company, added other discourses of 
a consoling and admonitory tendency, until at length, on the morning of the 14th 
of Nisan, he summoned the disciples to depart from Bethany and proceed to 
Jerusalem, in the words: <i>Arise, let us go hence </i>(xiv. 31). Here the 
synoptical account may be interposed, since it represents the two disciples as 
being sent forward to Jerusalem to prepare for the paschal meal, and then 
records its celebration, concerning which John is silent, and only </p>

<p ALIGN="center">695</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">takes up the thread of the narrative at the discourses delivered 
after the paschal meal (xv. 1 ff.).<sup>* </sup>But this attempt to avoid 
contradiction by referring the respective narratives to totally different 
events, is counteracted by the undeniable identity of many features in the two 
meals. Independeritly of isolated particulars which are found alike in both 
accounts, it is plain that John, as well as the synoptists, intends to describe 
the last meal of which Jesus partook with his disciples. This is implied in the 
introduction to John’s narrative; for the proof which is there said to be given 
of Jesus having loved his own <i>unto the end, </i><font FACE="Symbol">eiV teloV</font>, 
may be the most suitably referred to his last moments of companionship with 
them. In like manner, the discourses after the meal point to the prospect of 
immediate separation; and the meal and discourses are, in John also, immediately 
followed by the departure to Gethsemane and the arrest of Jesus. It is true 
that, according to the above opinion, these last-named incidents are connected 
only with those discourses which were delivered on the occasion of the later 
meal, omitted by John (xv. 17) : but that between xiv. 31 and xv. 1 the author 
of the fourth gospel intentionally omitted the whole incident of the paschal 
meal, is a position which, although it might appear to explain with some 
plausibility the singular <font FACE="Symbol">egeiresqe, agwmen enteuqen</font><i>, 
Arise, let us go hence, </i>no one will now seriously maintain. But even 
admitting such an ellipsis, there still remains the fact that Jesus (xiii. 38) 
foretells to Peter his denial with this determination of time:
<font FACE="Symbol">ou mh alektwr fwnhsh</font><i>, the cock shall not crow, </i>
which he could only make use of at the last meal, and not, as is here 
presupposed, at an earlier one.† </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus this expedient must be relinquished, and it must be 
admitted that all the Evangelists intend to speak of the same meal, namely, the 
last of which Jesus partook with his disciples. And in making this admission, 
the fairness which we owe to every author, and which was believed to be due in a 
peculiar degree to the authors of the Bible, appeared to demand an enquiry 
whether, although they represent one and the same event with great divergencies 
in several respects, yet nevertheless both sides may not be correct. To obtain 
an affirmative result of this inquiry it must be shown, as regards the time, 
either that the three first Evangelists, as well as the fourth, do not intend to 
describe a paschal meal, or that the latter, as well as the former, does so 
intend.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an ancient Fragment<sup>‡ </sup>it is sought to solve the 
problem in the first method, by denying that Matthew places the last meal of 
Jesus at the proper time for the paschal meal, the evening of the 14th of Nisan, 
and his passion on the first day of the feast of the passover, the 15th of 
Nisan; but one does not see how the express indications respecting the passover 
in the synoptists can be neutralized.</p>

Chron. Paschal. ed. du Fresne. Paris, 1688, p. 6 f. præf.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">696</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence it has been a far more general attempt in recent times, to 
draw John to the side of the other Evangelists.* His expression <i>before the 
feast of the passover, </i><font FACE="Symbol">pro thV eorthV tou pasca </font>
(xiii. 1), was thought to be divested of its difficulty by the observation that 
it is not immediately connected with the <i>supper </i><font FACE="Symbol">
deipnon</font>, but only with the statement that Jesus knew that his hour was 
come, and that he loved his own unto the end; it is only in the succeeding verse 
that there is any mention of the meal, to which therefore that determination of 
time does not refer. But to what then can it refer? to the knowledge that his 
hour was come? this is only an incidental remark; or to the love which endured 
to the end? but to this so special a determination of time can only refer, if an 
external proof of love be intended, and such an one is presented in his conduct 
at the meal, which consequently remains the point to which that determination of 
the day must apply. It is therefore conjectured farther that the words
<font FACE="Symbol">pro thV eorthV tou pasca</font> were used out of 
accommodation to the Greeks for whom John wrote: since that people did not, like 
the Jews, begin their day with the evening, the meal taken at the beginning of 
the first day of the passover, would appear to them to be taken on the evening 
before the passover. But what judicious writer, if he supposes a misconstruction 
possible on the part of the reader, chooses language which can only serve to 
encourage that misconstruction? A still more formidable difficulty is presented 
by xviii. 28, where the Jews, on the morning after the<i> </i>imprisonment of 
Jesus, will not enter the judgment hall <i>lest they should be defiled, but that 
they may eat the passover,</i>&#61472; <font FACE="Symbol">all</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">ina 
fagwsi to pasca</font><i>. </i>Nevertheless it was supposed that passages such 
as Deut. xvi. i, <i>2, </i>where all the sacrifices to be killed during the time 
of the passover are denoted by the expression [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>pesakh</b>, 
authorise the interpretation of <font FACE="Symbol">to pasca </font>in this 
place of the remaining sacrifices to be offered during the paschal week, and 
especially of the Chagiga, which was to be consumed towards the end of the first 
feast day. But as Mosheim has correctly remarked, from the fact that the paschal 
lamb, together with the rest of the sacrifices to be offered during the feast of 
the passover was designated <font FACE="Symbol">pasca</font><i>, </i>it by no 
means follows that these can be so designated with the exclusion of the paschal 
lamb.† On the other hand, the friends of the above view have sought to show the 
necessity of their mode of interpretation, by observing that for the eating of 
the passover which was celebrated late in the evening, consequently at the 
commencement of the succeeding day, the entering of a Gentile house in the 
morning, being a defilement which lasted only through the current day, would 
have been no disqualification; but that it would have been such for the 
partaking of the Chagiga, which was eaten in the afternoon, consequently on the 
same day on which the defilement was contracted; so that only this, and </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>See especially Tholuck and Olshausen, in loc.; Kern, 
Hauptthatsachen, Tüb. Zeitschr.<i> </i>1836, 3, s. 5 ff.</p>
<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Diss. de vera notione coene Domini, annexed to Cudworth, 
syst. intel1., p. 22, not. 1.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">697</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">not the passover, can have been intended. But first, we do not 
know whether entrance into a Gentile house was a defilement for the day merely; 
secondly, if such were the case, the Jews, by a defilement contracted in the 
morning, would still have disqualified themselves from participating in the 
preparatory proceedings, which fell on the afternoon of the 14th of Nisan; as, 
for example, the slaying of the lamb in the outer court of the temple. Lastly, 
in order to interpret the passage xix. 14 in consistency with their own view, 
the harmonists understand the <i>preparaIian of the passover, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">paraskeuh tou pasca</font><i>, </i>to mean the day of 
preparation for the sabbath in the Easter week; a violence of interpretation 
which at least finds no countenance in xix. 31, where the <font FACE="Symbol">
paraskeuh </font>is said to be the preparation for the sabbath, since from this 
passage it only appears, that the Evangelist conceived the first day of the 
passover as occurring that year on the sabbath.* </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These difficulties, which resist the reference of the narrative 
in John to a real paschal meal, appeared to be obviated by a presupposition 
derived from Lev. xxiii. <i>5; </i>Num. ix. 3; and a passage in Josephus ;<sup>†
</sup>namely, that the paschal lamb was eaten, not on the evening from the 14th 
to the 15th, but on that from the 13th to the 14th of Nisan, so that between the 
paschal meal and the first feast day, the 15th of Nisan, there fell a working 
day, the 14th. On this supposition, it would be correct that the day following 
the last paschal meal taken by Jesus, should be called, as in John xix. 14, <i>
the preparation of the passover, </i><font FACE="Symbol">paraskeuh tou pasca</font>, 
because it was actually a day of preparation for the feast day; it would also be 
correct that the following sabbath should be called <font FACE="Symbol">megalh
</font>(xix. 31), since it would coincide with the first day of the feast.‡ But 
the greatest difficulty, which lies in John xviii. <i>28, </i>remains unsolved; 
for on this plan the words, <i>that they might eat the passover, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">ina fagwsi to pasca</font>, must, since the paschal meal 
would be already past, be understood of the unleavened bread, which was eaten 
also during the succeeding feast days: an interpretation which is contrary to 
all the usages of language. If to this it be added, that the supposition of a 
working day falling between the passover and the first feast day, has no 
foundation in the Pentateuch and Josephus, that it is decidedly opposed to later 
custom, and is in itself extremely improbable; this expedient cannot but be 
relinquished.§ </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perceiving the impossibility of effecting the reconciliation of 
the synoptists with John by this simple method, other expositors have resorted 
to a more artificial expedient. The appearance of the Evangelists having placed 
the last meal of Jesus on different days, is alleged to have its truth in the 
fact, that either the Jews or Jesus </p>

<p ALIGN="center">698</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">celebrated the passover on another than the usual day. The Jews, 
say some, in order to avoid the inconvenience arising from the circumstance, 
that in that year the first day of the passover fell on a Friday, so that two 
consecutive days must have been solemnized as a sabbath, deferred the paschal 
meal until the Friday evening, whence on the day of the crucifixion they had 
still to beware of defilement; Jesus, however, adhering strictly to the law, 
celebrated it at the prescribed time, on the Thursday evening: so that the 
synoptists are right when they describe the last meal of Jesus as an actual 
celebration of the passover; and John also is right when he represents the Jews 
as, the day after, still looking forward to the eating of the paschal lamb.<sup>*
</sup>In this case, Mark would be wrong in his statement, that on the day <i>
when they killed the passover, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ote to pasca equon </font>
(v.<i> </i>12), Jesus also caused it to be prepared; but the main point is, that 
though in certain cases the passover was celebrated in a later month, it was 
still on the 15th day; there is nowhere any trace of a transference to a later 
day of the same month.—It has therefore been a more favourite supposition that 
Jesus anticipated the usual time of eating the passover. From purely personal 
motives, some have thought, foreseeing that at the proper time of the paschal 
supper he should be already lying in the grave, or at least not sure of life 
until that period, he, like those Jews who were prevented from journeying to the 
feast, and like all the Jews of the present day, without a sacrificed lamb, and 
with mere substitutes for it, celebrated a <i>commemorative passover, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">pasca mnhmoneutikon.<sup>† </sup></font>But in the first 
place, Jesus would not then, as Luke says, have kept the passover on the day <i>
on which the passover must be killed, </i><font FACE="Symbol">en h edei quesqai 
to pasca</font>; and secondly, in the merely commemorative celebration of the 
passover, though the prescribed locality (Jerusalem) is dispensed with, the 
regular time (the evening from the 14th to the 15th Nisan) is inviolably 
observed: whereas in the case of Jesus the reverse would hold, and he would have 
celebrated the passover at the usual place, but at an unusual time, which is 
without example. To shield the alleged transposition of the passover by Jesus 
from the charge of being unprecedented and arbitrary, it has been maintained 
that an entire party of his cotemporaries joined in celebrating the passover 
earlier than the great body of the nation. It is known that the Jewish sect of 
the Caraites or Scripturalists differed from the Rabbinites or Traditionalists 
especially in the determination of the new moon, maintaining that the practice 
of the latter in fixing the new moon according to astronomical calculation was 
an innovation, whereas they, true to the ancient, legal practice, determined it 
according to an empirical observation of the phase of the new luminary. Now in 
the time of Jesus, we are told, the Sadducees, from whom the Caraites are said 
to have sprung, determined the time of the new moon, and with it that of the 
festival of the passover, which was dependent upon it, </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Calvin, in Matth. xxvi. 17.</p>
<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Grotius, in Matth. xxvi. 18.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">699</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">differently from the Pharisees and Jesus, as the opponent of 
tradition and the friend of scripture, favoured their practice in this matter.* 
But not to insist that the connexion of the Caraites with the ancient Sadducees 
is a mere conjecture; it was a well-founded objection put forth by the Caraites, 
that the determination of the new moon by calculation did not arise until after 
the destruction of the temple by the Rornans; so that at the time of Jesus such 
a difference cannot have existed; nor is there besides any indication to be 
discovered that at that time the passover was celebrated on different days by 
different parties.† Supposing, however, that the above difference as to the 
determining of the new moon already prevailed in the time of Jesus, the settling 
of it according to the phase, which Jesus is supposed to have followed, would 
rather have resulted in a later than an earlier celebration of the passover; 
whence some have actually conjectured that more probably Jesus followed the 
astronomical calculation.<sup>‡ </p>
</sup>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides what may thus be separately urged against every attempt 
at an amicable adjustment of the differences between the Evangelists, as to the 
time of the last supper; there is one circumstance which is decisive against 
all, and which only the most recent criticism has adequately exposed. With 
respect, namely, to this contradiction, the case is not so that among passages 
for the most part harmonious, there appear only one or two statements of an 
apparently inconsistent sense, of which it might be said that the author had 
here used an inaccurate expression, to be explained from tile remaining 
passages: but, that <i>all </i>the chronological statements of the synoptists 
tend to show that Jesus must have celebrated the passover, <i>all </i>those of 
John, on the contrary, that he cannot have celebrated it.§ Thus there stand 
opposed to each other two differing series of evangelical passages, which are 
manifestly based on two different views of the fact on the part of the 
narrators: hence, as Sieffert remarks, to persist in disputing the existence of 
a divergency between the Evangelists, can no longer be regarded as scientific 
exposition, but only as unscientitic arbitrariness and obstinacy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Modern criticism is therefore constrained to admit, that on one 
side or the other there is an error; and, setting aside the current prejudices 
in favour of the fourth gospel, it was really an important reason which appeared 
to necessitate the imputation of this error to the synoptists. The ancient 
Fragment attributed to Apollinaris, mentioned above, objects to the opinion that 
Jesus <i>suffered on the great day of unleavened bread, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
th megalh hmera twn azumwn epaqen</font><i>, </i>that this would have been <i>
contrary to the law</i> <font FACE="Symbol">asumfwnoJV tw nomw</font><i>; </i>
and in recent times also it has been observed, that the day following the last 
meal of Jesus is treated on all sides so entirely as a working day, that it 
cannot be supposed the first day of the passover, nor, </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">consequently, the meal of the previous evening, the paschal 
meal. Jesus does not solemnize the day, for he goes out of the city, an act 
which was forbidden on the night of the passover; nor do his friends, for they 
begin the preparations for his burial, and only leave them unfinished on account 
of the arrival of the next day, the sabbath still less do the members of the 
Sauhedrim keep it sacred, for they not only send their servants out of the city 
to arrest Jesus, but also personally undertake judicial proceedings, a trial, 
sentence, and accusation before the Procurator; in general, there appears, 
throughout, only the fear of desecrating the following day, which commenced on 
the evening of the crucifixion, and nowhere any solicitude about the current 
one: clear signs that the synoptical representation of the meal as a paschal 
one, is a later error, since in the remaining narrative of the synoptists 
themselves, there is evidence, not easy to be mistaken, of the real fact, that 
Jesus was crucified before the passover.<sup>* </sup>These observations are 
certainly of weight. It is true that the first, relative to the conduct of 
Jesus, might perhaps be invalidated by the contradiction existing between the 
Jewish decisions as to the law cited<sup>† </sup>while the last and strongest 
may be opposed by the fact, that trying and giving sentence on the sabbaths and 
feast days was not only permitted among the Jews, but there was even a larger 
place for the administration of justice on such days, on account of the greater 
concourse of people; so, also, according to the New Testament itself, the Jews 
sent out officers to seize Jesus on the <i>great day </i><font FACE="Symbol">
hmera megalh </font>of the Feast of Tabernacles (John vii. 44 1.),<i> </i>and at 
the Feast of Dedication they were about to stone him (John X. 31), while Herod 
caused Peter to be imprisoned during the <i>days of unleavened bread; </i>though 
indeed he intended to defer the public sentencing and execution until alter the 
passover (Acts xii. <i>2 </i>f.). In proof that the crucifixion of Jesus might 
take place on the feast of the passover, it is urged that the execution was 
performed by Roman soldiers; and that moreover, even according to Jewish custom, 
it was usual to reserve the execution of important criminals for a feast time, 
in order to make an impression on a greater multitude.‡ But only thus much is to 
be proved: that during the feast time, and thus during the passover, on the five 
intermediate and less solemn days, criminals were tried and executed,—not that 
this was admissible also on the first and last days of the passover, which 
ranked as sabbaths:§ and thus we read in the Talmud that Jesus was crucified on 
the [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>‘rb pskh</b>, i.e. the evening before the 
passover.|| It would be another </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">thing if, as Dr. Baur strives to prove, the execution of 
criminals, as a sanguinary expiation for the people, belonged to the essential 
significance of the passover, as a feast of expiation, and hence the custom, 
noticed by the Evangelists, of liberating a prisoner at the feast had been only 
the reverse side to the execution of another, presenting the same relation as 
that between the two goats and the two sparrows in the Jewish offerings of 
atonement and purification.* </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is certainly very possible that the primitive Christian 
tradition might be led even unhistorically to associate the last supper of Jesus 
with the paschal lamb and the day of his death with the feast of the passover As 
the Christian supper represented in its form, the passover, and in its import, 
the death of Jesus: it was natural enough to unite these two points—to place the 
execution of Jesus on the first day of the passover, and to regard his last 
meal, at which he was held to have founded the Christian supper, as the paschal 
meal. It is true that presupposing the author of the first gospel to have been 
an apostle and a participator in the last meal of Jesus, it is difficult to 
explain how he could fall into such a mistake. At least it is not enough to say, 
with Theile, that the more the last meal partaken with their master transcended 
all paschal meals in interest to the disciples, the less would they concern 
themselves as to the time of it, whether it occurred on the evening of the 
passover, or a day earlier.† For the first Evangelist does not leave this 
undetermined, but speaks expressly of a paschal meal, and to this degree a real 
participator, however long he might write after that evening, could not possibly 
deceive himself. Thus on the above view, the supposition that the first 
Evangelist was an eye-witness must be renounced, and he must be held, in common 
with the two intermediate ones, to have drawn his materials from tradition.‡ The 
difficulty arising from the fact, that all the synoptists, and consequently all 
those writers who have preserved to us the common evangelical tradition, agree 
in such an error,§ may perhaps be removed by the observation, that just as 
generally as in the Judæo-Christian communities, in which the evangelical 
tradition was originally formed, the Jewish passover was still celebrated, so 
generally must the effort present itself to give that feast a Christian import, 
by referring it to the death and the last meal of Jesus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But it is equally easy, presupposing the correctness of the 
synoptical determination of time, to conceive how John might be led erroneously 
to place the death of Jesus on the afternoon of the 14th of Nisan, and his last 
meal on the previous evening. If, namely, this Evangelist found in the 
circumstance that the legs of the crucified Christ were not broken, a fulfilment 
of the words <i>Not a bone</p>

between the death of Jesus and the paschal lamb might suggest to him the idea, 
that at the same time in which the paschal lambs were killed, on the afternoon 
of the 14th of Nisan, Jesus suffered on the cross and gave up the ghost ;<sup>*
</sup>in which case the meal taken the evening before was not the paschal meal.†
</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus we can conceive a possible cause of error on both sides, 
and since the internal difficulty of the synoptical determination of time, 
namely, the manifold violations of the first day of the passover, is in some 
degree removed by the observations above cited, and is counterpoised by the 
agreement of three Evangelists: our only course is to acknowledge an 
irreconcilable contradiction between the respective accounts, without venturing 
a decision as to which is the correct one.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 122. DIVERGENCIES IN RELATION TO THE OCCURRENCES AT THE LAST 
MEAL OF JESUS.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only in relation to the time of the last meal of Jesus, but 
also in relation to what passed on that occasion, there is a divergency between 
the Evangelists. The chief difference lies between the synoptists and the fourth 
gospel: but, on a stricter comparison, it is found that only Matthew and Mark 
closely agree, and that Luke diverges from them considerably, though on the 
whole he is more accordant with his predecessors than with his successor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides the meal itself, the following features are common to 
all the accounts: that, during the meal, the coming betrayal by Judas is spoken 
of; and that, during or after the meal, Jesus predicts to Peter his denial. As 
minor differences we may notice, that in John, the mode of indicating the 
traitor is another and more precise than that described by the other 
Evangelists, and has a result of which the latter are ignorant; and that, 
further, in the fourth gospel the meal is followed by prolonged farewell 
discourses, which are not found in the synoptists: but the principal difference 
is, that while according to the synoptists Jesus instituted the Lord’s supper at 
this final meal, in John he instead of this washes the disciples’ feet.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The three synoptists have in common the instituting of the 
Lord’s supper, together with the announcement of the betrayal, and the denial; 
but there exists a divergency between the two first and the third as to the 
order of these occurrences, for in the former the announcement of the betrayal 
stands first, in the latter, the instituting of the Supper; while the 
announcement of Peter’s denial, in Luke, apparently takes place in the room in 
which the repast had been held, in the two other Evangelists, on the way to the 
Mount of </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Comp. Suicer, thesaur. 2, s. 613.</p>
<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Another view as to the cause of the error in the fourth 
gospel is given in the Probabilia, s. 100 ff.; comp. Weisse, die evang. Gesch. 
I, s. 446 f. Anm.</p>
<i>

</i>
<p ALIGN="center">703</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Olives. Again, Luke introduces some passages which the two first 
Evangelists either do not give at all, or not in this connexion: the contention 
for pre-eminence and the promise of the twelve thrones, have in their narratives 
a totally different position; while what passes in Luke on the subject of the 
swords is in them entirely wanting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his divergency from the two first Evangelists, Luke makes 
some approximation to the fourth. As John, in the washing of the disciples’ 
feet, presents a symbolical act having reference to ambitious contention for 
pre-eminence, accompanied by discourses on humility: so Luke actually mentions a 
contention for pre-eminence, and appends to it discourses not entirely without 
affinity with those in John ; further, it is in common with John that Luke makes 
the observations concerning the betrayer occur at the opening of the repast, and 
after a symbolical act; and lastly, that he represents the announcement of 
Peter’s denial as having been delivered in the room where the repast had been 
held.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The greatest difficulty here naturally arises from the 
divergency, that the institution of the Lord’s supper, unanimously recorded by 
the synoptists, is wanting in John,:who in its stead relates a totally different 
act of Jesus, namely, the washing of the disciples’ feet. Certainly, by those 
who, in similar cases, throughout the whole previous course of the evangelical 
narrative, have found a sufficient resource in the supposition, that it was the 
object of John to supply the omissions of the earlier gospels, the present 
difficulty is surmounted as well, or as ill, as any other. John, it is said, saw 
that the institution of the Supper was already narrated in the three first 
Evangelists in a way which fully agreed with his own recollection; hence he held 
a repetition of it superfluous.* But if, among the histories already recorded in 
the three first gospels, the fourth Evangelist really intended to reproduce only 
those in the representation of which he found something to rectify or supply: 
why does he give another edition of the history of the miraculous feeding, in 
which he makes no emendation of any consequence, and at the same time omit the 
institution of the Lord’s supper? For here the divergencies between the 
synoptists in the arrangement of the scene, and the turn given to the words of 
Jesus, and more especially the circumstance that they, according to his 
representation, erroneously, make that institution occur on the evening of the 
passover, must have appeared to him a reason for furnishing an authentic 
account. In consideration of this difficulty, the position that the author of 
the fourth gospel was acquainted with the synoptical writings, and designed to 
complete and rectify them, is now, indeed, abandoned; but it is still maintained 
that he was acquainted with the common oral tradition, and supposed it known to 
his readers also, and on this ground, it is alleged, he passed over the 
institution of the Supper as a history </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Paulus, 3, b, s. 499<i>; </i>Olshausen, 2, s. 294.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">705</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">generally known.* But that it should be the object of an 
evangelical writing to narrate only the less known, omitting the known, is an 
idea which cannot be consistently entertained. Written records imply a mistrust 
of oral tradition; they are intended not merely as a supplement to this, but 
also as a means of fixing and preserving it, and hence the capital facts, being 
the most spoken of, and therefore the most exposed to misrepresentation, are 
precisely those which written records can the least properly omit. Such a fact 
is the founding of the Lord’s supper, and we find, from a comparison of the 
different New Testament accounts, that the expressions with which Jesus 
instituted it must have early received additions or mutilations ; consequently, 
it is the last particular which John should have omitted. But, it is further 
said, the narrating of the institution of the Lord’s supper was of no importance 
to the object of the fourth gospel.† How so? With regard to its general object, 
the convincing of its readers that <i>Jesus is the Christ the Son of God </i>
(xx. 31), was it of no importance to communicate a scene in which he appears as 
the founder of a <i>new covenant,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">kainh diaqhkh</font>? 
and in relation to the special object of the passage in question, namely, the 
exhibiting of the love of Jesus as a love which endured unto the end (xiii. 1), 
would it have contributed nothing to mention how he offered his body and blood 
as meat and drink to his followers, and thus realized his words in John vi.? 
But, it is said, John here as elsewhere, only concerns himself with the more 
profound discourses of Jesus, for which reason he passes over the institution of 
the Supper, and begins his narrative with the</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">discourse connected with the washing of the disciples’ feet.‡ 
Nothing, however, but the most obdurate prejudice in favour of the fourth 
gospel, can make this discourse on humility appear more profound than what Jesus 
says of the partaking of his body and blood, when instituting the Lord’s supper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the main point is that harmonists should show us in what 
part of John’s narrative, if we are to believe that he presupposed Jesus to have 
instituted the Supper at this last meal, he can have made the alleged 
omission—that they should indicate the break at which that incident may be 
suitably introduced. On looking into the different commentaries, there appears 
to be more than one place excellently adapted to such an insertion. According to 
Olshausen, the end of the 13th chapter, after the announcement of Peter’s 
denial, presents the interval in which the institution of the Supper must be 
supposed to occur; herewith the repast closed, and the succeeding discourses 
from xiv. 1 were uttered by Jesus after the general rising from table, and while 
standing in the chamber.§ But, here, it appears as if Olshausen, for the sake of 
obtaining a resting place between xiii. 38 and xiv. 1, had resigned himself to 
the delusion of supposing that the words <i>Arise, let us go hence, </i>at which 
he makes Jesus rise from table and deliver the rest of his discourse standing, 
are found at the end of the 13th chapter, whereas they do not occur until the 
end of the 14th. Jesus had been speaking of going whither his disciples could 
not follow him, and had just rebuked the rashness of Peter, in volunteering to 
lay down life for his sake, by the prediction of his denial: here, at xiv. 1 
ff., he calms the minds of the disciples, whom this prediction had disturbed, 
exhorting them to faith, and directing their attention to the blessed effects of 
his departure.—Repelled by the firm coherence of this part of the discourse, 
other commentators, e.g. Paulus, retreat to xiii. 30, and are of opinion that 
the institution of the Supper may be the most fitly introduced after the 
withdrawal of Judas, for the purpose of putting his treachery into execution, 
since this circumstance might naturally excite in Jesus those thoughts 
concerning his death which lie at the basis of the institution.|| But even 
rejecting the opinion of Lücke and others, that <font FACE="Symbol">ote exhlqe
</font><i>when he went out, </i>should be united to <font FACE="Symbol">legei o 
IhsouV</font>, <i>Jesus said, </i>it is unquestionable that the words of Jesus 
v. 31, <i>Now</i> <i>is the Son of man glorified, </i>etc., and what he says 
farther on (v.<i> </i>33) of his speedy departure, have an immediate reference 
to the retiring of Judas. For the verb <font FACE="Symbol">doxazein </font>in<font FACE="Symbol">
</font>the fourth gospel always signifies the glorification of Jesus, to which 
he is to be led by suffering; and with the departure of the apostate disciple to 
those who brought suffering and death on Jesus, his glorification and his speedy 
death were decided.—The verses 31—33 being thus inseparably connected with v. 
30; the next step is to carry the institution of the Supper somewhat lower, and 
place it where this connexion may appear to cease: accordingly, Lücke makes it 
fall between v. 33 and 34. supposing that after Jesus (v. 3 1—33) had composed 
the minds of the disciples, disturbed and shocked by the departure of the 
traitor, and had prepared them for the sacred meal, he, at v. 34 f., annexes to 
the distribution of the bread and wine the new commandment of love. But, as it 
has been elsewhere remarked, ¶<sup> </sup>since at v. 36 Peter asks Jesus, in 
allusion to v. 33, whither he will go, it is impossible that the Supper can have 
been instituted after the declaration of Jesus v. 33; for otherwise Peter would 
have interpreted the expression <i>I go, </i><font FACE="Symbol">upagw</font>, 
by the <i>body given </i><font FACE="Symbol">swma didomenon </font>and the <i>
blood shed, </i><font FACE="Symbol">aima</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ekcunomenon</font><i>
</i>or in any case would rather have felt prompted to ask the meaning of these 
latter expressions.— Acknowledging this, Neander retreats a verse, and inserts 
the Supper between v. 32<i> </i>and 33;* but he thus violently severs the 
obvious connexion between the words euquV doxasei auton <i>shall straightway 
glorify him </i>in the former verse, and the words <font FACE="Symbol">eti 
mikron meq</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">umwn eimi </font><i>yet a little while I 
am with you </i>in the latter.—It is, therefore, necessary to retreat still 
farther than Neander, or even Paulus : but as from v. 30 up to v. 18, the 
discourse turns uninterruptedly </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">on the traitor, and this discourse again is inseparably linked 
to the washing of the disciples’ feet and the explanation of that act, there is 
no place at which the institution of the Supper can be inserted until the 
beginning of the chapter. Here, however, according to one of the most recent 
critics, it may be inserted in a way which perfectly exonerates the author of 
the gospel from the reproach of misleading his reader by an account which is 
apparently continuous, while it nevertheless passes over the Supper. For, says 
this critic, from the very commencement John does not profess to narrate 
anything of the meal itself, or what was concomitant with it, but only what 
occurred after the meal; inasmuch as the most natural interpretation of
<font FACE="Symbol">deipnou genomenou </font>is: <i>after the meal was ended,
</i>while the words <font FACE="Symbol">egeiretai ek tou deipnou</font>, <i>he 
riseth from supper, </i>plainly show that the washing of the disciples’ feet was 
not commenced until after the meal.* But after the washing of the feet is 
concluded, it is said of Jesus, that he sat down again (<font FACE="Symbol">anapeswn 
palin </font>v. 12), consequently the meal was not yet ended when he commenced 
that act, and by the words <i>lie riseth from supper, </i>it is meant that he 
rose to wash the disciples’ feet from the yet unfinished meal, or at least after 
the places had been taken preparatory to the meal. Again, <font FACE="Symbol">
deipnou genomenou</font> does not mean: <i>after a meal was ended, </i>any more 
than the words <font FACE="Symbol">tou I. genomenou en Bhqania </font>(Matt. 
xxvi. 6) mean: <i>after Jesus had been in Bethany: </i>as the latter expression 
is intended by Matthew to denote the time during the residence of Jesus in 
Bethany, so the former is intended by John to denote the course of the meal 
itself.† Hence he thereby professes to inform us of every remarkable occurrence 
connected with that meal, and in omitting to mention the institution of the 
Lord’s supper, which was one of its features, he incurs the reproach of having 
given a deficient narrative, nay of having left out precisely what is most 
important.—Instead of this highest extremity of John’s account, Kern has 
recently taken the lowest, and has placed the institution of the Supper after 
the words, <i>Arise, let us go hence, </i>xiv. 37 ; ‡ whereby he assigns to it 
the improbable and indeed unworthy position, of an act only occurring to Jesus 
when he is preparing to depart.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, viewing the subject generally, there is no conceivable 
motive why John, if he spoke of this last evening at all, should have omitted 
the institution of the Lord’s supper; while, on descending to a particular 
consideration, there is in the course of his narrative no point where it could 
be inserted: hence nothing remains but to conclude that he does not mention it 
because it was unknown to him. But as a means of resisting this conclusion, 
theologians, even such as acknowledge themselves unable to explain the omission 
of the institution, rely on the observation, that a rite so universally 
prevalent in the primitive church as was the Lord’s supper, cannot possibly have 
been unknown to the fourth Evangelist, whoever he </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">may have been.* Certainly, he knew of the Lord’s supper as a 
Christian rite, for this may be inferred from his 6th chapter, and unavoidably 
he must have known of it; it may, however, have been unknown to him under what 
circumstances Jesus formally instituted this observance. The referring of so 
revered an usage to the authority of Jesus himself was an object of interest to 
this Evangelist; but from unacquauntance with the synoptical scene, and also 
from a partiality for the mysterious, which led him to put into the mouth of 
Jesus expressions unintelligible at the moment, and only to be explained by the 
issue, he effected this purpose, not by making Jesus actually institute the 
rite, but by attributing to him obscure expressions about the necessity of 
eating his flesh and drinking his blood, which, being rendered intelligible only 
by the rite of the Lord’s supper introduced into the church after his death, 
might be regarded as an indirect institution of that rite.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As John omits the institution of the Lord’s supper, so the 
synoptists omit the washing of the disciples’ feet: but it cannot be maintained 
with equal decision that they were therefore ignorant of this incident; partly 
on account of its inferior importance and the more fragmentary character of this 
part of the synoptical narrative ; and partly because, as has been above 
remarked, the contention for pre-eminence in Luke v.<i> </i>24 ff. has appeared 
to many expositors to be connected with the washing of the disciples’ feet, as 
the inducement to that action on the part of Jesus.† But as regards this 
contention for pre-eminence, we have shown above, that being unsuited to the 
tenor of the scene before us, it may owe its position only to a fortuitous 
association of ideas in the narrator :‡ while the washing of the disciples’ 
feet, in John, might appear to be a legendary development of a synoptical 
discourse on humility. In Matthew (xx. 26 ff.<i>) </i>Jesus admonishes his 
disciples that he among them who would be great must be the <i>minister </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">diakonoV </font>of the others, just as he himself came not 
to <i>be ministered unto but to minister </i><font FACE="Symbol">ou diakonhqhnai</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">alla</font> <font FACE="Symbol">diakonhsai</font><i>; </i>
and in Luke (xxii. 27) he expresses the same thought in the question: <i>Whether 
is greater, he that sitteth at meat or he that that serveth? </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">tiV gar meizwn; o anakeimenoV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">h o 
diakonwn</font><i>; </i>and adds, <i>but I am among you as he that serveth,</i>
<font FACE="Symbol">ego de eimi en mesw umwn wV o diakonwn</font><i>. </i>Now it 
is certainly probable that Jesus might see fit<i> </i>to impress this lesson on 
the disciples through the medium of their senses, by an actual <i>serving </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">diakonein </font>among them, while they played the part of 
those sitting at meat (<font FACE="Symbol">anakeimenoi</font>);<i> </i>but it is 
equally probable, since the synoptists are silent respecting such a measure, 
that either the legend, before it reached the fourth Evangelist, or this writer 
himself, spun the fact out of the dictum.§ Nor is it necessary to suppose that 
the above declaration </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">came to him as having been uttered at the last meal of Jesus, in 
accordance with the representation of Luke; for it naturally resulted from the 
expressions <font FACE="Symbol">anakeisqai </font><i>(to recline at meat), </i>
and <font FACE="Symbol">diakonein </font><i>(to serve), </i>that this 
symbolizing of the relation which they denote should be attached to a meal, and 
this meal might on easily conceivable grounds appear to be the most 
appropriately represented as the last.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Luke’s representation, Jesus on this occasion 
addresses the disciples as those who had continued with him in his temptations, 
and as a reward for this fidelity promises them that they shall sit with him at 
table in his kingdom, and seated on thrones, judge the twelve tribes of Israel 
(v. 28—30). This appears incongruous with a scene in which he had immediately 
before announced his betrayal by one of the twelve, and in which he</p>

<i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Immediately after predicted his denial by another; at a time, 
moreover, in which the <i>temptations </i><font FACE="Symbol">peirasmoi </font>
properly so called, were yet future. After what we have already observed in 
relation to the entire character of the scene in Luke, we can hardly seek the 
reason for the insertion of this fragment of a discourse, in anything else than 
a fortuitous association of ideas, in which the contention about rank among the 
disciples might suggest the rank promised to them by Jesus, and the discourse on 
sitting at table and serving, the promise that the disciples should sit at table 
with Jesus in his messianic kingdom.* </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the succeeding conversation Jesus says to his disciples 
figuratively, that now it will be necessary to buy themselves swords, so 
hostilely will they be met on all sides, but is understood by them literally, 
and is shown two swords already in the possession of the society. Concerning 
this passage I am inclined to agree with Schleiermacher, who is of opinion that 
Luke introduced it here as a prelude to Peter’s use of the sword in the ensuing 
narrative.† </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other divergencies in relation to the last meal will come 
under review in the course of the following investigations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 123. ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE BETRAYAL AND THE DENIAL.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the statement that Jesus from the beginning knew who would be 
his betrayer, the fourth gospel stands alone; but all four of the Evangelists 
concur in testifying that at his last meal he predicted his betrayal by one of 
his disciples.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But in the first place there is this difference: while according 
to Matthew and Mark the discourse respecting the betrayer opens the scene, and 
in particular precedes the institution of the Lord’s supper (Matt. xxvi. 21 ff.<i>;
</i>Mark xiv. 18 ff<i>.); </i>Luke represents Jesus as not speaking of the 
betrayer until after the commencement of the meal, and the institution of the 
commemorative rite (xxii. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">16<i> </i>Comp. De Wette, in loc.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">17<i> </i>Ueber den Lukas, s. <i>275.</p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="center">709</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">21<i> </i>ff.<i>); </i>and in John what relates to the betrayer 
goes forward during and after the washing of the disciples’ feet (xiii. 10—30). 
The intrinsically trivial question, which Evangelist is here right, is extremely 
important to theologians, because its decision involves the answer to another 
question, namely, whether the betrayer also partook of the ritual Supper. It 
neither appeared consistent with the idea of that supper as a feast of the most 
intimate love and union, that a virtual alien like Judas should participate in 
it, nor did it seem to accord with the love and compassion of the Lord, that he 
should have permitted an unworthy disciple by this participation to aggravate 
his guilt.‡ So undesirable a view of the facts was believed to be avoided by 
following the arrangement of Matthew and Mark, and making the designation of the 
betrayer precede the institution of the Supper: for as it was known from John, 
that as soon as Judas saw himself detected and exposed, he withdrew from the 
company, it would thence appear that Jesus did not institute the Supper until 
after the retirement of the traitor.§ But this expedient is founded on nothing 
but an inadmissible incorporation of the narrative of John with that of the 
synoptists. For the withdrawal of Judas is mentioned only by the fourth 
Evangelist; and he alone needs the supposition of such a circumstance, because, 
according to him, Judas now first entered into his transactions with the enemies 
of Jesus, and thus, in order to come to terms with them, and obtain the 
requisite force, needed a somewhat longer time. In the synoptists there is no 
trace of the betrayer having left the company; on the contrary, everything in 
their narrative appears to imply that Judas, first on the general departure from 
the room in which the repast had been taken, instead of going directly to the 
garden, went to the chief priests, of whom he at once, the agreement having been 
made beforehand, received the necessary force for the arrest of Jesus. Thus 
whether Luke or Matthew be right in the arrangement of the scene, all the 
synoptists intimate that Judas did not leave the company before the general 
departure, and consequently that he partook of the ritual Supper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But also as to the manner in which Jesus pointed out his 
betrayer, there exists no slight divergency between the Evangelists. In Luke 
Jesus only makes the brief remark that the hand of his betrayer is with him on 
the table, whereupon the disciples ask among themselves, who it can be that is 
capable of such a deed? In Matthew and Mark he says, first, that one of those, 
who are present will betray him ; and when the disciples individually ask him, 
Lord, is it I? he replies: <i>he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish; </i>
until at last, after a woe has been denounced on the traitor, according to 
Matthew, Judas also puts that question, and receives an affirmative answer. In 
John, Jesus alludes to the betrayer during and after the washing of the 
disciples’ feet, in the observations, that not all the disciples present are 
clean, and that </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Olshausen, 2, s<i>.</i> 380.</p>
<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Thus Lücke, Paulus, Olshausen.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">710</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">on the contrary the scripture must be fulfilled: <i>he that 
eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against me. </i>Then he says 
plainly, that one of them will betray him; the disciples look inquiringly at 
each other, wondering of whom he speaks, when Peter prompts John, who is lying 
next to Jesus, to ask who is the traitor? Jesus replies, he to whom he shall 
give a sop, which he immediately does to Judas, with an admonition to hasten the 
execution of his project; whereupon Judas leaves the company.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here again the harmonists are at once ready to incorporate the 
different scenes with each other, and render them mutually consistent. According 
to them, Jesus, on the question of each disciple whether he were the traitor, 
first declared aloud that one of his companions at table would betray him 
(Matthew); hereupon John asked in a whisper which of them he meant, and Jesus 
also in a whisper made the answer, he to whom he should give the sop (John) ; 
then Judas, likewise in a whisper, asked whether it were he, and Jesus in the 
same manner replied in the affirmative (Matthew); lastly, after an admonition 
from Jesus to be speedy, the betrayer left the company (John).* But that the 
question and answer interchanged between Jesus and Judas were spoken in a 
whisper, Matthew, who alone communicates them, gives no intimation, nor is this 
easily conceivable without presupposing the improbable circumstance, that Judas 
reclined on the one side of Jesus, as John did on the other: if, however, the 
colloquy were uttered aloud, the disciples could not, as John narrates, have so 
strangely misunderstood the words, <i>what thou doest, do quickly,—</i>and the 
supposition of a stammering question on the side of Judas, and a low-toned 
answer from Jesus, cannot be seriously held a satisfactory explanation.† Nor is 
it probable that Jesus, after having already made the declaration: he who 
dippeth with me in the dish will betray me, would for the more precise 
indication of the traitor have also given him a sop; it is rather to be supposed 
that these are but two different modes of reporting the same particular. But 
when once this is admitted, as it is by Paulus and Olshausen, so much is already 
renounced either in relation to the one narrative or the other, that it is 
inconsistent to resort to forced suppositions, in order to overcome the 
difficulty involved in the explicit answer which Matthew makes Jesus give to the 
traitor; and it should rather be allowed that we have before us two divergent 
accounts, of which the one was not so framed that its deficiencies might be 
supplied by the other.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having, with Sieffert and Fritzsche, attained this degree of 
insight, the only remaining question is: to which of the two narratives must we 
give the preference as the original? Sieffert has answered this question very 
decidedly in favour of John; not merely, as he maintains, because he shares in 
the prejudice which attributes to </p>

<p ALIGN="center">711</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">that Evangelist the character of an eye-witness; but also 
because his narrative is in this part, by its intrinsic evidence of 
truthfulness, and the vividness of its scenes, advantageously distinguished from 
that of Matthew, which presents no indications of an autoptical origin. For 
example, while John is able to describe with the utmost minuteness the manner in 
which Jesus indicated his betrayer: the narrative of the first gospel is such as 
to induce the conjecture that its author had only received the general 
information, that Jesus had personally indicated his betrayer.* It certainly 
cannot be denied, that the direct answer which Jesus gives to Judas in Matthew 
(v. 25)<i> </i>has entirely the appearance of having been framed, without much 
fertility of imagination, to accord with the above general information; and in 
so far it must be regarded as inferior to the more indirect, and therefore more 
probable mode of indicating the traitor, in John. But in relation to another 
feature, the result of the comparison is different. In the two first Evangelists 
Jesus says: <i>he who has dipped </i>or <i>who dippeth with me, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">o embayaV </font>or <font FACE="Symbol">embaptomenoV met</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">emou</font>: 
in John, <i>he to whom 1 shall give a sop when I have dipped it, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">w ego bayaV to ywmion epidwsw</font>;<i> </i>a difference in 
which the greater preciseness of the indication, and consequently the inferior 
probability, is on the side of the fourth gospel. In Luke, Jesus designates the 
traitor merely as one of those who are sitting at meat with him; and as regards 
the expression <font FACE="Symbol">o embayaV k. t.l.</font><i>. </i>in Matthew 
and Mark, the interpretation given of it by Kuinöl and Henneberg,† who suppose 
it to mean one of the party at table, leaving it uncertain which, is not so 
mistaken as Olshausen represents it to be. For, first, to the question of the 
several disciples, is it I? Jesus might see fit to return an evasive answer; and 
secondly, the above answer, as Kuinöl has correctly remarked, stands in the 
relation of an appropriate climax to the previous declaration: <i>one of you 
shall betray me </i>(v. 21), since it presents that aggravating circumstance of 
the betrayal, fellowship at table. Even if the authors of the two first gospels 
understood the expression in question to imply, that Judas in particular dipped 
his hand in the dish with Jesus, and hence supposed this second declaration to 
have indicated him personally: still the parallel passage in Luke, and the words
<font FACE="Symbol">eiV ek twn dwdeka</font>, <i>one of the twelve, </i>which in 
Mark precede <font FACE="Symbol">o embaptomenV</font>, show that originally the 
second expression was merely an amplification of the former, though from the 
wish to have a thoroughly unequivocal designation of the betrayer on the part of 
Jesus, it was early interpreted in the other more special sense. When, however, 
a legendary exaggeration of the preciseness of the indication is once admitted, 
the manner in which the fourth gospel describes that indication must be included 
in the series of progressive representations, and according to Sieffert, it must 
have been the original from which all the rest proceeded. But if we beforehand 
renounce the affirmative </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Comm. über die Gesch. des Leidens und Todes Jesu, in

<p ALIGN="center">712</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">reply to Judas, <font FACE="Symbol">su eipaV</font><i>, thou 
hast said,</i> in Matthew, the mode of designation in John is the most definite 
of all; for the intimation: one of my companions at table, is comparatively 
indefinite, and even the expression: he who dippeth with me in the dish, is a 
less direct sign of the traitor, than if Jesus had himself dipped the morsel and 
presented it to him. Now is it in the spirit of the ancient legend, if Jesus 
really gave the more precise designation, to lose its hold of this, and 
substitute one less precise, so as to diminish the miracle of the foreknowledge 
exhibited by Jesus? Assuredly not; but rather the very reverse holds true. Hence 
we conclude that Matthew, together with the unhistorically precise, has yet at 
the same time preserved the historically less precise; whereas John has entirely 
lost the latter and has retained only the former.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After thus renouncing what is narrated of a personal designation 
of the traitor by Jesus, as composed <i>post eventum, </i>there yet remains to 
us the general precognition and prediction on the part of Jesus, that one of his 
disciples and companions at table would betray him. But even this is attended 
with difficulties. That Jesus received any external notification of treason 
brooding against him in the circle of his confidential friends, there is no 
indication in the<i> </i>gospels: he appears to have gathered this feature of 
his destiny also out of the scriptures alone. He repeatedly declares that by his 
approaching betrayal the scripture will be fulfilled (John xiii. 18, xvii. 12 ; 
comp. Matt. xxvi. 24 parall.), and in the fourth gospel (xiii. 18), he cites as 
this <i>scripture, </i><font FACE="Symbol">grafh</font><i>, </i>the words: <i>He 
that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel againsi me, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">o trwgwn met</font>’ <font FACE="Symbol">eme thn pternan 
autou</font><i>, </i>from Ps. xli. 10. This passage in the Psalms refers either 
to the well-known perfidious friends of David, Ahithophel and Mephibosheth, or, 
if the Psalm be not the composition of David, to some unknown individuals who 
stood in a similar relation to the poet.* There is so little trace of a 
messianic significance, that even Tholuck and Olshausen acknowledge the above to 
be the original sense. But according to the latter, in the fate of David was 
imaged that of the Messiah; according to the former, David himself, under a 
divine impulse often used expressions concerning himself, which contained 
special allusions to the fate of Jesus. When, however, Tholuck adds: David 
himself, under the influence of inspiration, did not always comprehend this more 
profound sense of his expressions; what is this but a confession that by the 
interpretation of such passages as relating to Christ there is given to them 
another sense than that in which their author originally intended them? Now that 
Jesus deduced from this passage of the 41st Psalm, that it would be his lot to 
be betrayed by a friend, in the way of natural reflection, is the more 
inconceivable, because there is no indication to be discovered that this Psalm 
was interpreted messianically among the Jews : while that such an interpretation 
was a result of the divine knowledge in Jesus is impossible, because it is a 
false interpretation. It is rather to be supposed, that the passage in question 
was applied to the treachery of Judas only after the issue. It is necessary to 
figure to ourselves the consternation which the death of the Messiah must have 
produced in the minds of his first adherents, and the solicitous industry with 
which they endeavoured to comprehend this catastrophe; and to remember that to a 
mind of Jewish culture, to comprehend a fact or doctrine was not to reconcile it 
with consciousness and reason, but to bring it into harmony with scripture. In 
seeking such a result, the primitive Christians found predicted in the oracles 
of the Old Testament, not only the death of the Messiah, but also his falling by 
means of the perfidy of one of his friends, and even the subsequent fate and end 
of this traitor (Matt. xxvii. 9 f. ; Acts i. 20); and as the most striking Old 
Testament authority for the betrayal, there presented itself the above passage 
from Ps. xli., where the author complains of maltreatment from one of his most 
intimate friends. These vouchers from the Old Testament might be introduced by 
the writers of the evangelical history either as reflections from themselves or 
others by way of appendix to their narrative of the result, as is done by the 
authors of the first gospel and the Acts, where they relate the end of Judas: 
or, what would be more impressive, they might put them into the mouth of Jesus 
himself before the issue, as is done by the author of, the fourth gospel in the 
present instance. The Psalmist had meant by [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>’okel 
lakhmiy</b> one who <i>generally </i>was <i>accustomed </i>to eat bread with him 
: but this expression might easily come to be regarded as the designation of one
<i>in the act </i>of eating bread with the subject of the prophecy: and hence it 
seemed appropriate to choose as the scene for the delivery of the prediction, a 
meal of Jesus with his disciples, and for the sake uf proximity to the end of 
Jesus to make this meal the last. For the rest, the precise words of the psalm 
were not adhered to, for instead of <font FACE="Symbol">otrwgwn met</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">emou</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">ton arton</font><i>, he who eateth bread with me, </i>was 
substituted either the synonymous phrase <font FACE="Symbol">met</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">emou 
epi thV </font>&#61472;<font FACE="Symbol">traphzhV</font><i>, with me on the table,
</i>as in Luke; or, in accordance with the representation of the synoptists that 
this last was a paschal meal, an allusion to the particular sauce used on that 
occasion: <font FACE="Symbol">o embaptomenoV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">met</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">emou</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">eiV to trublion</font><i>, he who dippeth with me in the 
dish, </i>as in Mark and Matthew. This, at first entirely synonymous with the 
expression <font FACE="Symbol">o trwgwn k.t.l</font>., as a designation of some 
one of his companions at table, was soon, from the desire for a personal 
designation, misconstrued to mean that Judas accidentally dipped his hand into 
the dish at the same moment with Jesus, and at length the morsel dipped into the 
dish by Judas at the same time with Jesus, was by the fourth Evangelist 
converted into the sop presented by Jesus to his betrayer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are other parts also of this scene in John, which, instead 
of having a natural character, as Sieffert maintains, must rather be pronounced 
artificial. The manner in which Peter has to use the </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>See De Wette, in loc.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">714</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">intervention of the disciple leaning on Jesus’ bosom, in order 
to obtain from the latter a more definite intimation concerning the betrayer, 
besides being foreign to the synoptists, belongs to that unhistorical colouring 
which, as we have above shown, the fourth gospel gives to the relation of the 
two apostles. Moreover, to disguise an indication of Judas in the evil character 
of the traitor, beneath an action of friendliness, as that of giving him the 
sop, must retain something untruthful and revolting, whatever may be imagined of 
objects which Jesus might have in view, such as the touching of the traitor with 
compunction even at that hour. Lastly, the address, <i>What thou doest, do 
quickly, </i>after all that can be done to soften it,* is still harsh,—a kind of 
braving of the impending catastrophe; and rather than resort to any refinements 
in order to justify these words as spoken by Jesus, I prefer agreeing with the 
author of the Prohabilia, who sees in them the effort of the fourth Evangelist 
to improve on the ordinary representation, according to which Jesus foreknew the 
betrayal and refrained from preventing it, by making him even challenge the 
traitor to expedite his undertaking.† </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides the betrayal, Jesus is said to have predicted the denial 
by Peter, and to have fixed the precise time of its occurrence, declaring that 
before the cock should crow (Mark says twice) on the following morning, Peter 
would deny him thrice (Matt. xxvi. 33 ff. parall.): which prediction, according 
to the gospels, was exactly accomplished. It is here observed on the side of 
Rationalism, that the extension of the prophetic gift to the cognizance of such 
merely accessory circumstances as the crowing of cocks, must excite 
astonishment; as also that Jesus, instead of warning, predicts the result as 
inevitable :<sup>‡ </sup>a feature which calls to mind the Fate of the Greek 
tragedy, in which a man, in spite of his endeavour to avoid what the oracle has 
predicted of him, nevertheless fulfils its inexorable decree. Paulus will not 
admit either <font FACE="Symbol">ou fwnhsei shmeron alektwr</font><i>, </i>or
<font FACE="Symbol">aparneisqai </font>or <font FACE="Symbol">triV</font>, to 
have been spoken in their strict verbal signification, but gives to the entire 
speech of Jesus only this indecisive and problematical sense: so easily to be 
shaken is the imagined firmness of this disciple, that between the present 
moment and the early morning, events may arise which would cause him more than 
once to stumble and be unfaithful to his master. But this is not the right mode 
of removing the difficulty of the evangelical narrative. The words attributed to 
Jesus so closely agree with the subsequent event, that the idea of a merely 
fortuitous coincidence is not to be here entertained. Occurring as they do in a 
tissue of prophecies <i>post eventum, </i>we must rather suppose that after 
Peter had really denied Jesus more than once during that night, the announcement 
of such </p>

<p ALIGN="center">715</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">a result was put into the mouth of Jesus, with the common 
marking of time by the crowing of the cock,* and the reduction of the instances 
of denial to three. That this determination of time and number was permanent in 
the evangelical tradition (except that Mark, doubtless arbitrarily, for the sake 
of balancing the <i>thrice </i>denying by another number, speaks of the <i>twice
</i>crowing of the cock), appears to be explained without any great difficulty 
by the familiarity of the expressions early chosen, and the ease with which they 
could be retained in the memory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just as little claim to be regarded as a real prophecy has the 
announcement of Jesus to the rest of his disciples that they will all of them be 
offended because of him in the coming night, that they will forsake him and 
disperse. (Matt. xxvi. 31<i> </i>parall., comp. John xvi. <i>32); </i>especially 
as the Evangelists themselves, in the words: <i>For it is written, 1 will smite 
the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad, </i>point 
out to us the Old Testament passage (Zech. xiii. 7), which, first sought out by 
the adherents of Jesus for the satisfaction of their own difficulties as to the 
death of their master, and the melancholy consequences which immediately ensued, 
was soon put into the mouth of Jesus as a prophecy of these consequences.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 124. THE INSTITUTION OF THE LORD’S SUPPER.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was at the last meal, according to the synoptists, with whom 
the Apostle Paul also agrees (i Cor. xi. 23 ff.), that Jesus gave to the 
unleavened bread and the wine which, agreeably to <i>the </i>custom of the 
paschal feast,† he, as head of the family, had to distribute among his 
disciples, a relation to his speedily approaching death. During the repast, we 
are told, he took bread, and after giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his 
disciples with the declaration: <i>This is my body, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
touto esti to swma mou</font><i>, </i>to which Paul and Luke add: <i>which is 
given </i>or <i>broken for you, </i><font FACE="Symbol">uper umwn</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">didomenon</font> or <font FACE="Symbol">klwmenon</font><i>;
</i>in like manner,according to Paul and Luke after supper, he presented to them 
a cup of wine with the words: <i>This is my blood of the new testament, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">touto esti to aima mou to thV kainhV diaqhkhV</font><i>, </i>
or, according to Paul and Luke: <i>the new testament in my blood, which is shed

adds: <i>for the remission of sins, </i><font FACE="Symbol">eiV afesin amartiwn</font><i>,
</i>and Paul, what he and Luke previously give in reference to the bread <i>: Do 
this, </i><font FACE="Symbol">touto poieite</font> (Paul, with the wine, <i>as

<p ALIGN="LEFT">and wine into the body and blood of Christ, or a presence of the 
body and blood of Christ with and beneath those elements, or lastly, the 
symbolizing of the body and blood of Christ by bread and wine,—may be pronounced 
obsolete, and ought not to be any longer pursued, at least exegetically, because 
it is founded on a misplaced distinction. It is only when transmitted to a 
modern age, and to the occidental mind, in which the forms of thought are more 
abstract, that what the ancient oriental understood by the words,
<font FACE="Symbol">touto esti</font><i> </i>divides itself into the above 
variety of possible significations; and if we would obtain a correct conception 
of the idea which originally suggested the expression, we must cease to 
discriminate thus. To explain the words in question as implying a transmutation 
of the substance, is to go too far, and to be too definite; to understand them 
of an existence <i>cum et sub specie, etc., </i>is too much of a refinement; 
while to translate them: <i>this signifies, </i>is too limited and meagre an 
interpretation. To the writers of our gospels, the bread in the commernorative 
supper <i>was </i>the body of Christ: but had they been asked, whether the bread 
were transmuted, they would have denied it; had they been spoken to of a 
partaking of the body with and under the form of bread, they would not have 
understood it; had it been inferred that consequently the bread merely signified 
the body, they would not have been satisfied.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus to dispute farther on this point is a fruitless labour: it 
is a more interesting question, whether Jesus merely intended this peculiarly 
significant distribution of bread and wine as a parting demonstration of 
attachment to his disciples, or whether he designed that it should be celebrated 
by his disciples in memory of him after his departure. if we had only the 
account of the two first Evangelists,—this is admitted even by orthodox 
theologians,* — there would be no solid ground for the latter supposition; but 
the words, <i>Do this in rememberance of me, </i>which are added by Paul and 
Luke, appear decisive of the fact that Jesus purposed the founding of a 
commemorative meal, which, according to Paul, the Christians were to celebrate,
<i>until he should come </i><font FACE="Symbol">acriV ou an elqh</font>. 
Concerning this very addition, however, it has been of late conjectured that it 
may not have been originally uttered by Jesus, but that in the celebration of 
the Lord’s supper in the primitive church, the presiding member of the 
community, in distributing the elements, may have exhorted the rest to continue 
the repetition of this meal in remembrance of Christ, and that from this 
primitive Christian ritual the above words were added to the address of Jesus.† 
This conjecture should not be opposed by an exaggerated estimate of the 
authority of the Apostle Paul, such as that of Olshausen, who infers from the 
words, <i>I have received of the Lord, </i><font FACE="Symbol">parelabon apo tou 
Kuriou</font><i>, </i>that he here delivers an immediate revelation from Christ, 
nay, that Christ himself speaks through him : since, as even Süskind </p>

<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* </sup>Süskind, in the treatise: Hat Jesus das Abendmahl abs 
einen mnemonischen Ritus angeordnet? in his Magazin 11, s. 1 ff.</p>
<sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">† </sup>Paulus, exeg. Handb, 3, b, s. 527.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">717</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">has admitted, and as Schulz has recently shown in the most 
convincing manner,* the phrase <font FACE="Symbol">paralambanein apo tinoV
</font>cannot signify an immediate reception, but only a mediate transmission 
from the individual specified. If, however, Paul had not that addition from 
Jesus himself, still Süskind thinks himself able to prove that it must have been 
communicated, or at least confirmed, by an apostle, and is of opinion, in the 
manner of his school, that by a series of abstract distinctions, he can define 
certain boundary lines which must in this case prevent the intrusion of an 
unhistorical tradition. But the severe attention to evidence which characterizes 
our own day, ought not to be expected from an infant religious society, between 
the distant portions of which there was not yet any organized connexion, or for 
the most part any other than oral communication. On the other hand, however, we 
must not be induced to regard the words <font FACE="Symbol">touto poieite k. t. 
l.</font> as a later addition to the address of Jesus, on false grounds, such 
as, that it would have been repugnant to the humility of Jesus to found a rite 
in remembrance of himself;† nor must we rate too highly the silence of the two 
first Evangelists, in opposition to the testimony of Paul.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps this point may be decided by means of another more 
general question, namely, what led Jesus to make this peculiarly significant 
distribution of bread and wine among his disciples? Orthodox theologians seek to 
remove as far as possible from the person of Jesus, as divine, all progress, and 
especially a gradual or sudden origination of plans and resolutions not 
previously present in his mind: hence, according to them, there lay in Jesus 
from the beginning, together with the foreknowledge of his destiny, and his 
entire plan, the design to institute this supper, as a commemorative rite to be 
observed by his church; and this opinion may at least appeal for support, to the 
allusions implying that he already contemplated the institution a year 
beforehand, attributed to Jesus in the sixth chapter of the fourth gospel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is certainly an insecure support, for, as a previous 
enquiry has shown, those allusions, totally unintelligible before the 
institution of the Supper, cannot have proceeded from Jesus, but only from the 
Evangelist.‡ Further, as, viewing the subject generally, it appeared to annul 
the reality of the human nature in Jesus, to suppose that all lay foreseen and 
prepared in him from the first, or at least from the commencement of his mature 
age; Rationalism has maintained, on the contrary, that the idea of the 
symbolical act and words in question did not arise in Jesus until the last 
evening. According to this view, at the sight of the broken bread and the 
outpoured wine, Jesus had a foreboding of his near and violent death; he saw in 
the former an image of his body which was to be put to death, and in the latter 
of his blood which was to be shed; and this </p>

<p ALIGN="center">718</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">momentary impression was communicated by him to his disciples.§ 
But such a tragical impression could only be felt by Jesus if he contemplated 
his death as a near event. That he did so with a greater distinctness at the 
last meal, is thought to be proved by the assurance which, according to all the 
synoptists, he gave to his disciples, that he would no more drink of the fruit 
of the vine until he drank it new in the kingdom of his Father; whence, as there 
is no ground for supposing a vow of abstinence on his part, he must have 
foreseen that his end would arrive within the next few days. If, however, we 
observe how in Luke this assurance in relation to the wine is preceded by the 
declaration of Jesus, that he will no more eat the passover until it be 
fulfilled in the kingdom of God, it appears probable that originally the <i>
fruit of the vine </i>also was understood not as wine in general, but as 
specially the beverage of the passover; of which a trace may perhaps be 
discovered in the expression of Matthew and Mark—this <i>fruit of the vine, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">toutou tou</font> <font FACE="Symbol">gennhmatoV thV ampelou</font><i>.
</i>Meals in the messianic kingdom were, in accordance with the ideas of the 
age, often spoken of by Jesus, and he may have expected that in that kingdom the 
Passover would be observed with peculiar solemnity. When therefore he declares 
that he will no more partake of this meal in the present <i>age, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">aiwn</font><i>, </i>but only in the future; first, this does 
not apply to eating and drinking in general, and hence does not mean that his 
sojourn in this pre-messianic world was to have an end within the next few days, 
but only within the space of a year; nor, secondly, does it necessarily involve 
the idea that this change was to be introduced by his death, for he might even 
yet expect that the kingdom of the Messiah would commence during his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, to deny every presentiment of his end on the part of 
Jesus in these last days of his life, is on the one hand, not warranted by our 
previous examination, and on the other, would compel us to doubt the Institution 
of the ritual Supper by Jesus which we can hardly do in opposition to the 
testimony of Paul. It is moreover easily conceivable, that the continually 
increasing involvement of his relation to the Jewish hierarchy, might at length 
bring to Jesus the conviction that his death was inevitable, and that in a 
moment of emotion he might even fix the next passover as the term which he 
should not survive. Thus each of the supposed cases appears possible: either 
that, owing to a thought suggested by the impressiveness of the moment, at the 
last passover which he celebrated with his disciples, he made bread and wine the 
symbols of his body which was to be slain and his blood which was to be shed; or 
that for some time previously he had embraced the design of bequeathing such a 
commemorative meal to his adherents, in which case he may very probably have 
uttered the words preserved by Paul and Luke. But before this intimation of the 
death of Jesus had </p>

<p ALIGN="center">719</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">been duly appropriated by the disciples, and received into their 
conviction, they were overtaken by the actual catastrophe, for which, therefore, 
they might be regarded as wholly unprepared.</p>
