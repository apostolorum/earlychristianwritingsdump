<p align="center"><font size="4">RETIREMENT TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES, ARREST, 
TRIAL, CONDEMNATION </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">AND CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS.</font></p>
<p>§<i> </i>125. AGONY OF JESUS IN THE GARDEN.</p>
<p>According to the synoptical narratives, Jesus, immediately after the 
conclusion of the meal and the singing of the <i>Hallel, </i>it being his habit 
during this feast time to spend the night out of Jerusalem (Matt. xxi. 17 ; Luke 
xxii. 39), went to the Mount of Olives, into a <i>garden </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">cwrion</font><i> </i>(in John, <font FACE="Symbol">khpoV</font>) 
called Gethsemane (Matt. xxvi. 30, 36 parall.). John, who gives the additional 
particular that the garden lay over the brook Kedron, does not represent him as 
departing thither until after a long series of valedictory discourses 
(xiv.—xvii.), of which we shall hereafter have to speak again. While John makes 
the arrest of Jesus follow immediately on the arrival of Jesus in the garden, 
the synoptists insert between the two that scene which is usually designated the 
agony of Jesus.</p>
<p>Their accounts of this scene are not in unison. According to Matthew and 
Mark, Jesus takes with him his three most confidential disciples, Peter and the 
sons of Zebedee, leaving the rest behind, is seized with fearfulness and 
trembling, tells the<i> </i>three disciples that he is sorrowful even unto 
death, and admonishing them to remain wakeful in the mean time, removes to a 
distance from them also, that he may offer a prayer for himself, in which, with 
his face bent to the earth, he entreats that the cup of suffering may pass from 
him, but still resigns all to the will of his Father. When he returns to the 
disciples, he finds them sleeping, again admonishes them to watchfulness, then 
removes from them a second time, and repeats the former prayer, alter which he 
once more finds his disciples asleep. For the third time he retires to repeat 
the prayer, and returning, for the third time finds the disciples sleeping, but 
now awakes them, in order to meet the coming betrayer. Of the<i> </i>number 
three, which thus doubly figures in the narrative of the two first Evangelists, 
Luke says nothing; according to him, Jesus retires from all the disciples, after 
admonishing them to watch, for the distance of about a stone’s cast, and prays 
kneeling, once only, but </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">720</p>
<p>nearly in the same words as in the other gospels, then returns to the 
disciples and awakes them, because Judas is approaching with the multitude. But, 
on the other hand, Luke in his single scene of prayer, has two circumstances 
which are foreign to the other narrators, namely, that while Jesus was yet 
praying, and immediately before the most violent mental struggle, an angel 
appeared to strengthen him, and that during the <i>agony </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">agwnia</font> which ensued, the sweat of Jesus <i>was as it 
were great drops of blood falling to the ground.</p>
</i>
<p>From the earliest times this scene in Gethsemane has been a stumbling-block, 
because Jesus therein appears to betray a weakness and fear of death which might 
be considered unworthy of him. Celsus and Julian, doubtless having in their 
minds the great examples of a dying Socrates and other heathen sages, expressed 
contempt for the fear of death exhibited by Jesus.* Vanini boldly extolled his 
own demeanour in the face of execution as superior to that of Jesus <sup>† </sup>
and in the <i>Evangelium Nicodemi, </i>Satan concludes from this scene that 
Christ is a mere man.‡ The supposition resorted to in this apocryphal book, that 
the trouble of Jesus was only assumed in order to encourage the devil to enter 
into a contest with him,§ is but a confession of inability to reconcile a real 
truth of that kind with the ideal of Jesus. Hence appeal has been made to the 
distinction between the two natures in Christ; the sorrowfulness and the prayer 
for the removal of the cup having been ascribed to the human nature, the 
resignation to the will of the Father, to the divine.|| As however, in the first 
place, this appeared to introduce an inadmissible division in the nature of 
Jesus; and in the second place, even a fear experienced by his human nature in 
the prospect of approaching bodily sufferings appeared unworthy of him: his 
consternation was represented as being of a spiritual and sympathetic 
character—.as arising from the wickedness of Judas, the danger which threatened 
his disciples, and the fate which was impending over his nation.<sup>¶ </sup>The

<p ALIGN="CENTER">721</p>
<p>physical suffering, or to his own person, attained its highest pitch in the 
ecclesiastical tenet, that Jesus by substitution was burthened with the guilt of 
all mankind, and vicariously endured the wrath of God against that guilt.* Some 
have even supposed that the devil himself wrestled with Jesus.<sup>†</sup> </p>
<p>But such a cause for the trouble of Jesus is not found in the text; on the 
contrary, here as elsewhere (Matt. XX. 22 f.<i> </i>parall.), the <i>cup </i>
<font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">pothrion </font>for the removal of which Jesus 
prays, must be understood of his own bodily sufferings and death. Moreover, the 
above ecclesiastical opinion is founded on an unscriptural conception of the 
vicarious office of Jesus. It is trite that even in the conception of the 
synoptists, the suffering of Jesus is a vicarious one for the sins of many; but 
the substitution consists, according to them, not in Jesus having immediately 
borne these sins and the punishment due to mankind on account of them, but in a 
personal suffering being laid upon him on account of those sins, and in order to 
remove their punishment. Thus, as on the cross, it was not directly the sins of 
the world, and the anger of God in relation to them, which afflicted him, but 
the wounds which he received, and his whole lamentable situation, wherein he was 
indeed placed for the sins of mankind: so, according to the idea of the 
Evangelists, in Gethsemane also, it was not immediately the feeling of the 
misery of humanity which occasioned his dismay, but the presentiment of his own 
suffering, which, however, was encountered in the stead of mankind.</p>
<p>From the untenable ecclesiastical view of the agony of Jesus, a descent has 
in more modern times been made to coarse materialism, by reducing what it was 
thought hopeless to justify ethically, as a mental condition, to a purely 
physical one, and supposing that Jesus was attacked by some malady in Gethsemane 
;‡ an opinion which Paulus, with a severity which he should only have more 
industriously applied to his own explanations, pronounces to be altogether 
unseemly and opposed to the text, though he does not regard as improbable 
Heumann’s hypothesis, that in addition to his inward sorrow, Jesus had 
contracted a cold in the clayey ground traversed by the Kedron.§ On the other 
hand, the scene has been depicted in the colours of modern sentimentalism, and 
the feelings of friendship, the pain of separation, the thoughts of parting, 
have been assigned as the causes which so lacerated the mind of Jesus :|| or a 
confused blending of all the different kinds of sorrow, selfish and sympathetic, 
sensual and spiritual, has been presupposed. <sup>¶</sup> Paulus explains

Jesus, as to whether it were the will of God that he should give himself up to 
the attack immediately at hand, or whether it were not more accordant with the 
Divine pleasure, that he should yet escape from this danger: thus converting 
into a mere inquiry of God, what is obviously the most urgent prayer.</p>
<p>While Olshausen falls back on the ecclesiastical theory, and authoritatively 
declares that the supposition of external corporeal suffering having called 
forth the anguish of Jesus, ought to be banished as one which would annihilate 
the essential characteristics of his mission; others have more correctly 
acknowledged that in that anguish the passionate wish to be delivered from the 
terrible sufferings in prospect, the horror of sensitive nature in the face of 
annihilation, are certainly apparent.* With justice also it is remarked, in 
opposition to the reproach which has been cast on Jesus, that the speedy 
conquest over rebellious nature removes every appearance of sinfulness † that, 
moreover, the shrinking of physical nature at the prospect of annihilation 
belongs to the essential conditions of life ‡ nay, that the purer the human 
nature in an individual, the more susceptible is it in relation to suffering and 
annihilation ; § that the conquest over suffering intensely appreciated is 
greater than a stoical or even, a Socratic insensibility.|| </p>
<p>With more reason, criticism has attacked the peculiar representation of the 
third gospel. The strengthening angel has created no little difficulty to the 
ancient church on dogmatical grounds,—to modern exposition on critical grounds. 
An ancient scholium on the consideration, <i>That he who was adored and 
glorified with fear and trembling, </i>by <i>all the celestial powers, did not 
need the strengthening qf the angel, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oti thV iscuoV tou

interprets the <font FACE="Symbol">eniscuein</font> ascribed to the angel as a

others, rather than admit that Jesus could need to be strengthened by an angel, 
transform the <font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">aggeloV eniscuwn</font><i> </i>into 
an evil angel, who attempted to use force against Jesus.<sup>* </sup>The 
orthodox also, by founding a distinction between the state of humiliation and 
privation in Christ and that of his glorification, or in some similar way, have 
long blunted the edge of the dogmatical difficulty: but in place of this a 
critical objection has been only so much the more decidedly developed. In 
consideration of the suspicion which, according to our earlier observations, 
attaches to every alleged </p>

<p>angelic appearance, it has been sought to reduce the angel in this narrative 
first into a man,* and then into an image of the composure which Jesus 
regained.† But the right point in the angelic appearance for criticism to 
grapple with, is indicated by the ciicumstance that Luke is the only Evangelist 
from whom we learn it.‡ If, according to the ordinary presupposition, the first 
and fourth gospels are of apostolic origin; why this silence as to the angel on 
the part of Matthew, who is believed to have been in the garden, why especially 
on the part of John, who was among the three in the nearer neighbourhood of 
Jesus? If it be said: because sleepy as they were, and at some distance, and 
moreover under cover of the night, they did not observe him: it must be asked, 
whence are we to suppose that Luke received this information?§ That, assuming 
the disciples not to have themselves observed the appearance, Jesus should have 
narrated it to them on that evening, there is, from the intense excitement of 
those hours and the circumstance that the return of Jesus to his disciples was 
immediately followed by the arrival of Judas, little probability; and as little, 
that he communicated it to them in the days after the resurrection, and that 
nevertheless this information appeared worthy of record to none but the third 
Evangelist, who yet received it only at second hand. As in this manner there is 
every presumption against the historical character of the angelic appearance; 
why should not this also, like all appearances of the same kind which have come 
under our notice, especially in the history of the infancy of Jesus, he 
interpreted by us mythically? Gabler has been before us in advancing the idea, 
that in the primitive Christian community the rapid transition from the most 
violent mental conflict to the most tranquil resignation, which was observable 
in Jesus on that night, was explained, agreeably to the Jewish mode of thought, 
by the intervention of a strengthening angel, and that this explanation may have 
mingled itself with the narrative: Schleiermacher, too, finds it the most 
probable that this moment, described by Jesus himself as one of hard trial, was 
early glorified in hymns by angelic appearances, and that this embellishment, 
originally intended in a merely poetical sense, was received by the narrator of 
the third gospel as historical.|| </p>
<p>The other feature peculiar to Luke, namely, the bloody sweat, was early felt 
to be no less fraught with difficulty than the strengthening by the angel. At 
least it appears to have been this more than anything else, which occasioned the 
exclusion of the entire addition in Luke, v. 43 and 44, from many ancient copies 
of the gospels. For as the orthodox, who according to Epiphanius <sup>¶</sup> 
rejected the passage, appear to have shrunk the most from the lowest degree of 
fear which is expressed by the bloody sweat: so to the docetic opinions of some 
who did not receive this passage,* this was the only particular which could give 
offence. Thus in an earlier age, </p>

<p>doubts were raised respecting the fitness of the bloody sweat of Jesus on 
dogmatical considerations: while in more modern times this has been done on 
physiological grounds. It is true that authorities are adduced for instances of 
bloody sweat from Aristotle * down to the more recent investigators of nature; † 
but such a phenomenon is only mentioned as extremely rare, and as a symptom of 
decided disease. Hence Paulus points to the <font FACE="Symbol">wsei</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
</font><i>(as it were), </i>as indicating that it is not directly a bloody sweat 
which is here spoken of, but only a sweat which might be compared to blood: this 
comparison, however, he refers only to the thick appearance of the drops, and 
Olshausen also agrees with him thus far, that a red colour of the perspiration 
is not necessarily included in the comparison. But in the course of a narrative 
which is meant as a prelude to the sanguinary death of Jesus, it is the most 
natural to take the comparison of the sweat to drops of blood, in its full 
sense. Further, here, yet more forcibly than in relation to the angelic 
appearance, the question suggests itself: how did Luke obtain this information? 
or to pass by all questions which must take the same form in this instance as in 
the previous one, how could the disciples, at a distance and in the night, 
discern the falling of drops of blood? According to Paulus indeed it ought not 
to be said that the sweat fell, for as the word <font FACE="Symbol">
katabainonteV</font><i>, falling, </i>refers not to <font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
idrwV </font><i>sweat, </i>but to the <font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">qromboi 
aimatoV</font><i>, drops of blood, </i>which are introduced merely for the 
purpose of comparison, it is only meant that a sweat as thick and heavy as 
falling drops of blood stood on the brow of Jesus. But whether it be said: the 
sweat fell like drops of blood to the earth, or: it was like drops of blood 
falling to the earth, it comes pretty much to the same thing; at least the 
comparison of a sweat standing on the brow to blood falling on the earth would 
not be very apt, especially if together with the falling, we are to abstract 
also the colour of the blood, so that of the words, <i>as it were drops of blood 
falling on the ground, </i><font FACE="Symbol">wsei</font><i> </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">qromboi</font> <font FACE="Symbol">aimatoV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">katabainonteV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">eiV thn ghn</font> 
only <font FACE="Symbol">wsei</font><i> </i><font FACE="Symbol">qromboi</font><i>, 
as it were drops, </i>would properly have any decided meaning. Since then we can 
neither comprehend the circumstance, nor conceive what historical authority for 
it the narrator could have had, let us, with Schleiermacher, rather take this 
feature also as a poetical one construed historically by the Evangelist, or 
better still, as a mythical one, the origin of which may be easily explained 
from the tendency to perfect the conflict in the garden as a prelude to the 
sufferings of Jesus on the cross, by showing that not merely the psychical 
aspect of that suffering was fore-shadowed in the mental trouble, but also its 
physical aspect, in the bloody sweat.</p>
<p>As a counterpoise to this peculiarity of Luke, his two predecessors have, as 
we have said, the twofold occurrence of the number three,—the three disciples 
taken apart, and the three retirements and prayers of Jesus. It has indeed been 
contended that so restless </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>De part. animal. iii. 15.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Vid. ap. Michaelis, not. in loc., and Kuinöl, in Luc., p. 691 f.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">725</p>
<p>a movement hither and thither, so rapid an alternation of retirement and 
return, is entirely suited to the state of mind in which Jesus then was,* and 
also, that in the repetition of the prayer there is correctly shown an 
appropriate gradation; a more and more complete resignation to the will of the 
Father.† But that the two narrators count the retirements of Jesus, marking them 
by the expressions <font FACE="Symbol">ek deuterou </font>and
<font FACE="Symbol">ek tritou; </font>at once shows that the number three was a 
point of importance to them; and when Matthew, though he certainly gives in the 
second prayer an expression somewhat different from that of the first, in the 
third makes Jesus only repeat <i>the same words, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ton 
auton logon</font>, and when Mark does this even the second time,—this is a 
significant proof that they were embarrassed how to fill up the favourite number 
three with appropriate matter. According to Olshausen, Matthew, with his three 
acts of this conflict, must be right in opposition to Luke, because these three 
attacks made on Jesus through the medium of fear, correspond to the three 
attacks through the medium of desire, in the history of the temptation. This 
parallel is well founded; it only leads to an opposite result to that deduced by 
Olshausen. For which is more probable; that in both cases the threefold 
repetition of the attack had an objective ground, in a latent law of the kingdom 
of spirits, and hence is to be regarded as really historical; or that it had 
merely a subjective ground in the manner of the legend, so that the occurrence 
of this number here, as certainly as above in the history of the temptation, 
points to something mythical? ‡ </p>
<p>If then we subtract the angel, the bloody sweat, and the precisely threefold 
repetition of the retirement and prayer of Jesus, as mythical additions, there 
remains so far, as an historical kernel, the fact, that Jesus on that evening in 
the garden experienced a violent access of fear, and prayed that his sufferings 
might be averted, with the reservation nevertheless of an entire submission to 
the will of God: and at this point of the inquiry, it is not a little 
surprising, on the ordinary view of the relation between our gospels, that even 
this fundamental fact of the history in question, is wanting in the Gospel of 
John.</p>

<p>§ 126. RELATION OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL TO THE EVENTS IN GETHSEMANE. THE 
FAREWELL DISCOURSES IN JOHN, AND THE SCENE FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
GREEKS.</p>
<p>The relation of John to the synoptical narratives just considered has, when 
regarded more closely, two aspects: first, he has not what the synoptists 
present; and secondly, instead of this he has something which it is difficult to 
reconcile with their statements.</p>
<p>As regards the first and negative side, it has to be explained </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">726</p>
<p>how, on the ordinary supposition concerning the author of the fourth gospel 
and the correctness of the synoptical account, it happens that John, who 
according to the two first gospels was one of the three whom Jesus took with 
him, to be the more immediate witnesses of his conflict, passes in silence over 
the whole event? It will not suffice to appeal to his sleepiness during the 
scene; for, if this was a hindrance to its narration, all the Evangelists must 
have been silent on the subject, and not John alone. Hence the usual expedient 
is tried here also, and he is said to have omitted the scene because he found it 
already presented with sufficient care in the writings of the synoptists.* But 
between the two first synoptists and the third there is here so important a 
divergency, as to demand most urgently that John, if he took their accounts into 
consideration, should speak a mediating word in this difference. If however, 
John had not the works of his predecessors lying before him, he might still, it 
is said, suppose that history to be sufficiently familiar to his readers as a 
part of evangelical tradition.† But as this tradition was the source of the 
divergent representations of the synoptists, it must itself have early begun to 
exhibit variations, and to narrate the fact first in one way, then in another: 
consequently on this view also there was a call on the author of the fourth 
gospel to rectify these wavering accounts. Hence of late an entirely new 
supposition has been adopted, namely, that John omits the events in Gethsemane 
lest, by the mention of the strengthening angel, he should give any furtherance 
to the Ebionitish opinion that the higher nature in Christ was an angel, which 
united itself with him at baptism; and now as it might be inferred, again 
departed from him before the hour of suffering.‡ But—not to urge that we have 
already found any hypothesis of this nature inadequate to explain the omissions 
in the Gospel of John—if this Evangelist wished to avoid any indication of a 
close relation between Jesus and angels, he must also have excluded other 
passages from his gospel : above all, as Lücke remarks,§ the declaration 
concerning the ascending and descending of angels upon him, i. 52;<i> </i>and 
also the idea, given indeed only as the conjecture of some bystanders, that <i>
an angel spake to him, </i><font FACE="Symbol">aggeloV autw lelahken</font>, 
xii. 29. If, however, he on any ground whatever, found special matter of 
hesitation in the appearance of the angel in the garden: this would only be a 
reason for omitting the intervention of the angel, with Matthew and Mark, and 
not for excluding the whole scene, which was easily separable from this single 
particular.</p>
<p>If the mere absence of the incident from the narrative of John is not to be 
explained, the difficulty increases when we consider what this Evangelist 
communicates to us instead of the scene in the garden, concerning the mental 
condition of Jesus during the last hours previous to his arrest. In the same 
place which the synoptists </p>

<p>assign to the agony in the garden, John, it is true, has nothing, for he 
makes the capture of Jesus follow at once on his arrival in the garden: but 
immediately before, at and after the last meal, he has discourses inspired by a 
state of mind, which could hardly have as a sequel scenes like those which 
according to the synoptical narratives occurred in the garden In the farewell 
discourses in John, namely, xiv —xvii Jesus speaks precisely in the tone of one 
who has already inwardly triumphed over approaching suffering; from a point of 
view in which death is quenched in the beams of the glory which is to come 
after; with a divine peace which is cheerful in the certainty of its 
immovability: how is it possible that immediately after, this peace should give 
place to the most violent mental emotion, this tranquillity, to a trouble even 
unto death, and that from victory achieved he should sink again into doubtful 
contest, in which he needed strengthening by an angel? In those farewell 
discourses, he appears throughout as one who from the plenitude of his inward 
serenity and confidence, comforts his trembling friends: and yet he now seeks 
spiritual aid from the drowsy disciples, for he requests them to watch with him; 
there, he is so certain of the salutary effects of his approaching death, as to 
assure his followers, that it is well for them that he should go away, else the
<i>Comforter </i><font FACE="Symbol">paraklhtoV </font>would not come to them: 
here, he again doubts whether his death be really the will of the Father; there, 
he exhibits a consciousness which under the necessity of death, inasmuch as it 
comprehends that necessity, recovers freedom, so that his will to die is one 
with the divine will that he should die: here, these two wills are so at 
variance, that the subjective, submissively indeed, but painfully, bows to the 
absolute. And these two opposite states of mind are not even separated by any 
intervening incident of an appalling character, but only by the short space of 
time which elapsed during the walk from Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives, across 
the Kedron: just as if, in that brook, as in another Lethe, Jesus had lost all 
remembrance of the foregoing discourses.</p>
<p>It is true that we are here referred to the alternation of mental states, 
which naturally becomes more rapid in proportion as the decisive moment 
approaches ;<sup>* </sup>to the fact that not seldom in the life of believers 
there occurs a sudden withdrawal of the higher sustenance of the soul, an 
abandonment of them by God, which alone renders the victory nevertheless 
achieved truly great and admirable.† But this latter opinion at once betrays its 
unintelligent origin from a purely imaginative species of thought (to which the 
soul can appear like a lake, ebbing or flowing according as the floodgates of 
the conducting canals are opened or closed), by the contradictions in which it 
is on all sides involved. The triumph of Christ over the fear of death is said 
only to appear in its true magnitude, when we consider, that while a Socrates 
could only conquer because he remained in the full possession of his mental </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">728</p>
<p>energies, Christ was able to triumph over all the powers of darkness, even 
when forsaken by God and the fulness of his spirit, by his merely human <i>soul
</i><font FACE="Symbol">yuch</font>:—but is not this the rankest Pelagianism, 
the most flagrant contradiction of the doctrine of the church, as of sound 
philosophy, which alike maintain that without God, man can do no good thing, 
that only by his armour can man repel the shafts of the wicked one? To escape 
from thus contradicting the results of sober reflection, the imaginative thinker 
is driven to contradict himself, by supposing that in the strengthening angel 
(which, incidentally, contrary to the verbal significance of the text, is 
reduced to a merely internal vision of Jesus) there was imparted to Jesus, when 
wrestling in the extremity of his abandonment, an influx of spiritual strength; 
so that he thus would not, as it was at first vaunted, have conquered without, 
but only with Divine aid; if, in accordance with Luke, the angel be supposed to 
have appeared prior to the last, most violent part of the conflict, in order to 
strengthen Jesus for this ultimate trial. But rather than fall into so evident a 
self-contradiction, Olshausen prefers covertly to contradict the text, and hence 
transposes the order of the incidents, assuming, without further preliminary, 
that the strengthening came after the third prayer, consequently after the 
victory had been already gained, whence he is driven to the extreme 
arbitrariness of interpreting the phrase: <font FACE="Symbol">kai genomenoV en</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">agwnia ektenesteron proshuceto</font><i>, and being in an 
agony he prayed, </i>as the pluperfect—<i>he had prayed.</p>
</i>
<p>But setting aside this figurative representation of the cause which produced 
the sudden change of mood in Jesus; such a change is in itself burthened with 
many difficulties. Correctly speaking, what here took place in Jesus was not a 
mere change, but a relapse of the most startling kind. In the so-called 
sacerdotal prayer, John xvii. especially, Jesus had completely closed his 
account with the Father; all fear in relation to what awaited him lay so far 
behind the point which he had here attained, that he spent not a single word on 
his own suffering, and only spoke of the afflictions which threatened his 
friends; the chief subject of his communion with the Father was the glory into 
which he was about to enter, and the blessedness which he hoped to have obtained 
for his followers : so that his departure to the scene of his arrest has 
entirely the character of an accessory fact, merely consummating by external 
realization what was already inwardly and essentially effected. Now if Jesus 
after this closing of his account with God, once more opened it; if after having 
held himself already victor, he once more sank into anxious conflict: must he 
not have laid himself open to the remonstrance: why didst thou not, instead of 
indulging in vain anticipations of glory, rather occupy thyself betimes with 
earnest thoughts of the coming trial, that by such a preparation, thou mightest 
spare thyself perilous surprise on its approach? why didst thou utter the words 
of triumph before thou hadst fought, so as to be obliged with shame </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">729</p>
<p>to cry for help at the on-coming of the battle? In fact after the assurance 
of already achieved victory expressed in the farewell discourses, and especially 
in the final prayer, the lapse into such a state of mind as that described by 
the synoptists, would have been a very humiliating declension, which Jesus could 
not have foreseen, otherwise he would not have expressed himself with so much 
confidence; and which, therefore, would prove that he was deceived in himself, 
that he held himself to be stronger than he actually found himself, and that he 
had given utterance to this too high self-valuation, not without a degree of 
presumption. Those who regard this as inconsistent with the equally judicious 
and modest character which Jesus manifests on other occasions, will find 
themselves urged to the dilemma, that either the farewell discourses in John, at 
least the final prayer, or else the events in Gethsemane, cannot be historical.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that in coming to a decision in this case, theologians 
have set out rather from dogmatical prejudices than from critical grounds. 
Usteri’s assertion, at least, that the representation given in John of the state 
of mind of Jesus in his last hours is the only correct one, while that of the 
synoptists is unhistorical,* is only to be accounted for by that author’s then 
zealous adherence to the paragraphs of Schleiermacher’s <i>Dogmatik, </i>wherein 
the idea of the impeccability of Jesus is carried to an extent which excludes 
even the slightest degree of conflict; for that, apart from such 
presuppositions, the representation given in John of the last hours of Jesus, is 
the more natural and appropriate, it might be difficult to prove. On the 
contrary, Bretschneider might rather appear to be right, when he claims the 
superiority in naturalness and intrinsic evidence of truth for the synoptists :<sup>†
</sup>were it not that our confidence in the decisions of this writer is 
undermined, by his dislike for the dogmatical and metaphysical purport of the 
discourses assigned to this period in John—a dislike which appears to indicate 
that his entire polemic against John originated in the discordance between his 
own critical philosophy of reflection, and the speculative doctrine of the 
fourth gospel.</p>
<p>John, indeed, as even the author of the Probabilia remarks, has not wholly 
passed over the anxiety of Jesus in relation to his approaching death; he has 
only assigned to it an earlier epoch, John xii. 27 ff<i>. </i>The scene with 
which John connects it takes place immediately after the entrance of Jesus into 
Jerusalem, when certain Greeks, doubtless proselytes of the gate, who had come 
among the multitude to the feast, wished to have an interview with him. With all 
the diversity of the circumstances and of the event itself; there is yet a 
striking agreement between what here occurs and what the synoptists place in the 
last evening of the life of Jesus, and in the seclusion of the garden. As Jesus 
here declares to his disciples, </p>

<p>my soul is troubled even unto death, </i><font FACE="Symbol">perilupoV estin

there he says: <i>Now is my soul troubled, </i><font FACE="Symbol">nun h yuch

entreats: <i>Father, save me from this hour, </i><font FACE="Symbol">pater,

here he calms himself by the restriction <i>nevertheless, not as I will, but as

here an <i>angel </i>appears <i>strengthening </i>Jesus, <font FACE="Symbol">
aggeloV eniscuwn </font>(Luke xxii. 43): so there something happens which 
occasions the bystanders to observe that <i>an angel spake to him, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">aggeloV autw lelalhken</font> (John xii. <i>29). </i>This 
similarity has induced many of the more modern theologians to pronounce the 
incident in John xii. <i>27 </i>ff., and that in Gethsemane identical; and after 
this admission the only question was, on which side the reproach of inaccurate 
narration, and more especially of erroneous position, ought to fall.</p>
<p>Agreeably to the tendency of the latest criticism of the gospels, the burthen 
of error in this matter has been more immediately cast on the synoptists. The 
true occasion of the mental conflict of Jesus is said to be found only in John, 
namely, in the approach of those Greeks who intimated to him through Philip and 
Andrew their wish for an interview with him. These persons doubtless wished to 
make the proposal that he should leave Palestine and carry forward his work 
among the foreign Jews; such a proposal held out to him the enticement of escape 
from the threatening danger, and this for some moments placed him in a state of 
doubt and inward conflict, which however ended by his refusing to admit the 
Greeks to his presence.* Here we have the effects of a vision rendered so acute 
by a double prejudice, both critical and dogmatical, as to read statements 
between the lines of the text; for of such an intended proposal on the part of 
the Greeks, there is no trace in John; and yet, even allowing that the 
Evangelist knew nothing of the plan of the Greeks from these individuals 
themselves, there must have been some intimation in the discourse of Jesus that 
his emotion had reference to such a proposal. Judging from the context, the 
request of the Greeks had no other motive than that the solemn entrance of 
Jesus, and the popular rumour concerning him, had rendered them curious to see 
and know the celebrated man; and this desire of theirs was not connected with 
the emotion which Jesus experienced on the occasion, otherwise than that it led 
Jesus to think of the speedy propagation of his kingdom in the Gentile world, 
and of its indispensable condition, namely, his death. Here, however, the idea 
of his death is only mediately and remotely presented </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Goldhorn, über das Schweigen des Joh. Evangeliums über den 
Seelenkampf Jesu in Gethsemane, in Tzschirner’s Magazin. f. christl. Prediger,

<p ALIGN="CENTER">731</p>
<p>to the soul of Jesus; hence it is the more difficult to conceive how it could 
affect him so strongly, as that he should feel himself urged to beseech the 
Father for delivery from this hour; and if he were ever profoundly moved by the 
presentiment of death, the synoptists appear to place this fear in a more 
suitable position, in immediate proximity to the commencement of his sufferings. 
The representation of John is also deficient in certain circumstances, presented 
by the synoptists, which appear to vindicate the trouble of Jesus. In the 
solitude of the garden and the gloom of night, such an ebullition of feeling is 
more conceivable; and its unrepressed utterance to his most intimate and worthy 
friends is natural and justifiable. But according to John that agitation seized 
Jesus in the broad daylight, in a concourse of people; a situation in which it 
is ordinarily more easy to maintain composure, or in which at least it is usual, 
from the possibility of misconstruction, to suppress the more profound emotions.</p>
<p>Hence it is more easy to agree with Theile’s opinion, that the author of the 
fourth gospel has inserted the incident, correctly placed by the synoptists, in 
a false position.* Jesus having said, as an introduction to the answer which he 
returned to the request of the Greeks, that they might see the man who had been 
so glorified by his entrance into the city: Yes, the hour of my glorification is 
come, but of glorification by death (xii. 23<i> </i>f.): this led the narrator 
astray, and induced him, instead of giving the real answer of Jesus to the 
Greeks together with the result, to make Jesus dilate on the intrinsic necessity 
of his death, and then almost unconsciously to interweave the description of the 
.internal conflict which Jesus had to experience in virtue of his voluntary 
sacrifice, whence he subsequently, in its proper place, omits this conflict. 
There is nothing strange in Theile’s opinion, except that he supposes it 
possible for the Apostle John to have made such a transposition. That the scene 
in Gethsemane, from his having been asleep while it was passing, was not deeply 
imprinted on his mind, and that it was besides thrust into the background of his 
memory by the crucifixion which shortly followed, might have been considered 
explanatory of an entire omission, or a merely summary account of the scene on 
his part, but by no means of an incorrect position. If notwithstanding his 
sleepiness at the time, he had taken any notice of the event, he must at least 
have retained thus much—that that peculiar state of mind in Jesus befel him 
close upon the commencement of his sufferings, in the night and in privacy: how 
could he ever so far belie his memory as to make the scene take place at a much 
earlier period, in the open day, and among many people? Rather than thus 
endanger the authenticity of the Gospel of John, others, alleging the 
possibility that such a state of mind might occur more than once in the latter 
part of the life of Jesus, deny the identity of the two scenes. † </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">733</p>
<p>Certainly, between the synoptical representation of the mental conflict of 
Jesus and that given in John, besides the external difference of position, there 
exist important internal divergencies; the narrative in John containing features 
which have no analogy with anything in the synoptical account of the events in 
Gethsemane. it is true that the petition of Jesus in John for for deliverance 
from <i>this hour, </i>is perfectly in unison with his prayer in the synoptists: 
but, on the other hand, there is no parallel to the additional prayer in John:
<i>Father, glorify thy name</i> <font FACE="Symbol">pater,</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">doxason sou to onoma</font> (xii. 28) : further, though in 
both accounts an angel is spoken of, yet there is no trace in the synoptists of 
the heavenly voice which in the fourth gospel occasions the belief that an angel 
is concerned. Such heavenly voices are not found in the three first gospels 
elsewhere than at the baptism and again at the transfiguration; of which latter 
scene the prayer of Jesus in John: <i>Father, glorify thy name, </i>may remind 
us. In the synoptical description of the transfiguration, it is true the 
expressions <font FACE="Symbol">doxa</font><i>, glory </i>and
<font FACE="Symbol">doxazein</font><i>, to glorify, </i>are not found: but the 
Second Epistle to Peter represents Jesus as receiving in the transfiguration <i>
honour and glory, </i><font FACE="Symbol">timhn kai doxan</font><i>, </i>and the 
heavenly voice as coming from the <i>excellent glory</i> <font FACE="Symbol">
megaloprephV doxa</font><i> </i>(i. 17 f.). Thus in addition to the two 
narratives already considered, there presents itself a third as a parallel; 
since the scene in John xii. 27 ff<i>. </i>is on the one side, by the trouble of 
spirit and the angel, allied to the occurrences in Gethsemane, while on the 
other side, by the prayer for glorification and the confirmatory voice from 
heaven, it has some affinity with the history of the transfiguration. And here 
two cases are possible: either that the narrative of John is the simple root, 
the separation of which into its constituent elements has given rise in a 
traditional manner to the two synoptical anecdotes of the transfiguration and 
the agony in the garden; or that these last are the original formations, from 
the fusing and intermingling of which in the legend the narrative of John is the 
mixed product: between which cases only the intrinsic character of the 
narratives can decide. That the synoptical narratives of the transfiguration and 
the agony in the garden are clear pictures, with strongly marked features, can 
by itself prove nothing; since, as we have sufficiently shown, a narrative of 
legendary origin may just as well possess these characteristics as one of a 
purely historical nature. Thus if the narrative in John were merely less clear 
and definite, this need not prevent it from being regarded as the original, 
simple sketch, from which the embellishing hand of tradition had elaborated 
those more highly coloured pictures. But the fact is that the narrative in John 
is wanting not only in definiteness, but in agreement with the attendant 
circumstances and with itself. We have no intimation what was the answer of 
Jesus to the Greeks, or what became of those persons themselves; no appropriate 
motive is given for the sudden anguish of Jesus and his prayer for 
glorification. Such a mixture of heterogeneous parts is always the sign of a 
secondary product, of an alluvial conglomeration; and hence we seem warranted to 
conclude, that in the narrative of John the two synoptical anecdotes of the 
transfiguration and the agony in the garden are blended together. If, as is 
apparently the case, the legend when it reached the fourth Evangelist presented 
these two incidents in faded colours,* and in indistinct outline: it would be 
easy for him, since his idea of <i>.glorification </i>(<font FACE="Symbol">doxazein</font>) 
had the double aspect of suffering and exaltation, to confuse the two; what he 
gathered from the narrative of the agony in the garden, of a prayer of Jesus to 
the Father, he might connect with the heavenly voice in the history of the 
transfiguration, making this an answer to the prayer; to the voice, the more 
particular import of which, as given by the synoptists, was unknown to him, he 
gave, in accordance, with his general notion of this incident as a <i>glory </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">doxa</font><i> </i>conferred on Jesus, the import : <i>I 
have both glorified and will glorify again, </i><font FACE="Symbol">kai edoxasa 
kai palin doxasw</font>, and to make it correspond with this divine response, he 
had to unite with the prayer of Jesus for deliverance that for glorification 
also; the strengthening angel, of which the fourth Evangelist had perhaps also 
heard something, was included in the opinion of the people as to the source of 
the heavenly voice; in regard to the time, John placed his narrative about 
midway between the transfiguration and the agony in the garden, and from 
ignorance of the original circumstances the choice in this respect was 
infelicitous.</p>
<p>If we here revert to the question from which we set out, whether we are 
rather to retain the farewell discourses in John as thoroughly historical, and 
renounce the synoptical representation of the scene in Gethsemane, or vice 
versa: we shall be more inclined, considering the result of the inquiry just 
instituted, to embrace the latter alternative. The difficulty, that it is 
scarcely conceivable how John could accurately remember these long discourses of 
Jesus, Paulus has thought to solve, by the conjecture, that the apostle, 
probably on the next Sabbath, while Jesus lay in the grave, recalled to his mind 
the conversations of the previous evening, and perhaps also wrote them down.† 
But in that period of depression, which John also shared, he would be scarcely 
in a condition to reproduce these discourses without obscuring their peculiar 
hue of unclouded serenity; on the contrary, as the author of the Wolfenbüttel 
fragments observes, had the narrative of the words and deeds of Jesus been 
committed to writing by the Evangelists in the couple of days after the death of 
Jesus, when they had no longer any hope, all promises would have been excluded 
from their gospels.‡ Hence even Lücke, in consideration of the mode of 
expression in the farewell discourses, and particularly in the final prayer, 
being so peculiarly </p>

<p>that of John, has relinquished the position that Jesus spoke in the very 
words which John puts into his mouth, i.e. the authenticity of these discourses 
in the strictest sense; but only to maintain the more firmly their authenticity 
in the wider sense, i.e. the genuineness of the substantial thoughts.* Even 
this, however, has been attacked by the author of the Probabilia, for he asks, 
with especial reference to chap. xvii., whether it be conceivable that Jesus in 
the anticipation of violent death, had nothing of more immediate concern than to 
commune with God on the subject of his person, the works he had already 
achieved, and the glory to be expected? and whether it be not rather highly 
probable that the prayer flowed only from the mind of the writer, and was 
intended by him as a confirmation of his doctrine of Jesus as the incarnate <i>
word </i><font FACE="Symbol">logoV</font>, and of the dignity of the apostles? † 
This representation is so far true that the final prayer in question resembles 
not an immediate outpouring of soul, but a product of reflection—is rather a 
discourse <i>on </i>Jesus than a discourse <i>from </i>him. It presents 
everywhere the mode of thought of one who stands far in advance of the 
circumstances of which he writes, and hence already sees the form of Jesus in 
the glorifying haze of distance; an illusion which he heightens by putting his 
own thoughts, which had sprung from an advanced development of the Christian 
community, into the mouth of its Founder prior to its actual existence. But in 
the preceding farewell discourses also there are many thoughts which appear to 
have taken their shape from an experience of the event. Their entire tone may he 
the most naturally explained by the supposition, that they are the work of one 
to whom the death of Jesus was already a past event, the terrors of which had 
melted away in its blessed consequences, and in the devotional contemplation of 
the church. In particular, apart from what is said of the return of Christ, that 
era in the Christian cause which is generally called the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, is predicted in the declarations concerning the Paraclete, and the 
judgment which he would hold over the world (xiv. i6 ff<i>. </i>25, xv. 26<i>,
</i>xvi. 7 ff. 13 ff<i>.), </i>with a distinctness which seems to indicate light 
borrowed from the issue.</p>
<p>In relation, however, to the fact that the farewell discourses involve the 
decided foreknowledge of the immediately approaching result, the sufferings and 
death of Jesus (xiii. 18 ff<i>., </i>33, 38, xiv. 30 f. xvi. 5 ff.<i> </i>16, 32 
f.), the narrative of John stands on the same ground with the synoptical one, 
since this also rests on the presupposition of the most exact prescience of the 
hour and moment when the sufferings will commence. It was not only at the last 
meal and on the departure to the Mount of Olives, that this foreknowledge was 
shown, according to the three first gospels, for in them as well as in John, 
Jesus predicts that the denial of Peter will take place before the cock crow; 
not only does the agony in the garden rest on the foreknowledge of the impending 
sufferings, but at the end of this conflict Jesus is able to say that now, at 
this very minute, the betrayer is in the act of approaching (Matt. xxvi. 45 f.). 
Paulus, it is true, maintains that Jesus saw from a distance the troop of guards 
coming out of the city, which, as they had torches, was certainly possible from 
a garden on the Mount of Olives: but without being previously informed of the 
plans of his enemies, Jesus could not know that he was the object of pursuit; 
and at any rate the Evangelists narrate the words of Jesus as a proof of his 
supernatural knowledge. But if according to our previous inquiry, the 
foreknowledge of the catastrophe in general could not proceed from the higher 
principle in Jesus, neither could that of the precise moment when it would 
commence; while that he in a natural way, by means of secret friends in the 
Sanhedrim, or otherwise, was apprised of the fatal blow which the Jewish rulers 
with the help of one of his disciples were about to aim at him in the coming 
night, we have no trace in our Evangelical accounts, and we are therefore not 
authorized to presuppose anything of the kind. On the contrary, as the above 
declaration of Jesus is given by the narrators as a proof of his higher 
knowledge, either we must receive it as such, or, if we cannot do this, we must 
embrace the negative inference, that they are here incorrect in narrating such a 
proof; and the positive conclusion on which this borders is, not that that 
knowledge was in fact only a natural one, but, that the evangelical narrators 
must have had an interest in maintaining a supernatural knowledge of his 
approaching sufferings on the part of Jesus; an interest the nature of which has 
been already unfolded.</p>
<p>The motive also for heightening the prescience into a real presentiment, and 
thus for creating the scene in Gethsemane, is easy of discovery. On the one 
hand, there cannot be a more obvious proof that a foreknowledge of an event or 
condition has existed, than its having risen to the vividness of a presentiment; 
on the other hand, the suffering must appear the more awful, if the mere 
presentiment extorted from him who was destined to that suffering, anguish even 
to bloody sweat, and prayer for deliverance. Further, the sufferings of Jesus 
were exhibited in a higher sense, as voluntary, if before they came upon him 
externally, he had resigned himself to them internally; and lastly, it must have 
gratified primitive Christian devotion, to withdraw the real crisis of these 
sufferings from the profane eyes to which he was exposed on the cross, and to 
enshrine it as a mystery only witnessed by a narrow circle of the initiated. As 
materials for the formation of this scene, besides the description of the sorrow 
and the prayer which were essential to it, there presented itself first the 
image of a <i>cup </i><font FACE="Symbol">pothrion</font>, used by Jesus himself 
as a designation of his sufferings (Matt. XX. 22 f.); and secondly, Old 
Testament passages, in Psalms of lamentation, xlii. 6, 12, xliii. 5, where in 
the LXX. the <font FACE="Symbol">yuch perilupoV <i>(</i></font><i>soul exceeding 
sorrowful) </i>occurs, and in addition to this the expression
<font FACE="Symbol">ewV qanatou </font><i>(unto death) </i>the more naturally 
suggested itself since </p>

<p>* </sup>2, s. 588 f.</p>

<p>† </sup>Ut sup.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">736</p>
<p>Jesus was here really about to encounter death. This representation must have 
been of early origin, because in the Epistle to the Hebrews (v. 7) there is an 
indubitable allusion to this scene.—Thus Gabler said too little when he 
pronounced the angelic appearance, a mythical garb of the fact</p>
<p>that Jesus in the deepest sorrow of that night suddenly felt an accession of 
mental strength; since rather, the entire scene in Gethsemane, because it rests 
on presuppositions destitute of proof, must be renounced.</p>
<p>Herewith the dilemma above stated falls to the ground, since we must 
pronounce unhistorical not only one of the two, but both representations of the 
last hours of Jesus before his arrest. The only degree of distinction between 
the historical value of the synoptical account and that of John is, that the 
former is a mythical product of the first era of traditional formation, the 
latter of the second,—or more correctly, the one is a product of the second 
order, the other of the third. The representation common to the synoptists and 
to John, that Jesus foreknew his sufferings even to the day and hour of their 
arrival, is the first modification which the pious legend gave to the real 
history of Jesus; the statement of the synoptists <i>, </i>that he even had an 
antecedent experience of his sufferings, is the second step of the mythical; 
while, that although he foreknew them, and also in one instance had a foretaste 
of them (John xii. 27 ff.)<i>, </i>he had yet long beforehand completely 
triumphed over them, and when they stood immediately before him, looked them in 
the face with unperturbed serenity—this representation of the fourth gospel is 
the third and highest grade of devotional, but unhistorical embellishment.</p>
<p>§ 127.<i> </i>ARREST OF JESUS.</p>
<p>In strict accordance with the declaration of Jesus that even now the betrayer 
is at hand, Judas while he is yet speaking approaches with an armed force (Matt. 
xxvi. 47 parall., comp. John xvii. 3). This band, which according to the 
synoptists came from the chief priests and elders, was according to Luke led by 
the <i>captains of the temple </i><font FACE="Symbol">strathgoiV tou ierou</font><i>,
</i>and hence was probably a detachment of the soldiers of the temple, to whom, 
judging from the word <font FACE="Symbol">ocloV</font>, and from <i>staves </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">xuloi</font> being mentioned among the weapons, was 
apparently joined a tumultuous crowd: according to the representation of John, 
who, together with the <i>servants </i>or <i>officers of the chief priests and 
Pharisees,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">uphretaiV twn arcierewn</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">kai Farisaiwn</font><i> </i>speaks of a <i>band </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">speira</font><i>, </i>and a <i>captain </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">ciliarkoV </font>without mentioning any tumultuary force, it 
appears as if the Jewish magistrates had procured as a support a detachment of 
Roman soldiery.* </p>
<p>According to the three first Evangelists, Judas steps forth and kisses Jesus, 
in order by this preconcerted sign to indicate him to the approaching band as 
the individual whom they were to seize: </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">737</p>
<p>according to the fourth gospel, on the contrary, Jesus advances apparently 
out of the garden (<font FACE="Symbol">exelqwn</font>)<i> </i>to meet them, and 
presents himself as the person whom they seek. In order to reconcile this 
divergency, some have conceived the occurrences thus: Jesus, to prevent his 
disciples from being taken, first went towards the multitude, and made himself 
known; hereupon Judas stepped forth, and indicated him by the kiss.† But had 
Jesus already made himself known, Judas might have spared the kiss; for that the 
people did not believe the assertion of Jesus that he was the man whom they 
sought, and still waited for its confirmation by the kiss of the bribed 
disciple, is a supposition incompatible with the statement of the fourth gospel 
that the words <i>I am he, </i>made so strong an impression on them that <i>they 
went backward and fell to the ground. </i>Hence others have inverted the order 
of the scene, imagining that Judas first stepped forward and distinguished Jesus 
by the kiss, and that then, before the crowd could press into the garden, Jesus 
himself advanced and made himself known.‡ But if Judas had already indicated him 
by the kiss, and he had so well understood the object of the kiss as is implied 
in his answer to it, Luke v. 48: there was no need for him still to make himself 
known, seeing that he was already made known; to do so for the protection of the 
disciples was equally superfluous, since he must have inferred from the 
traitor’s kiss, that it was intended to single him out and carry him away from 
his followers; if he did so merely to show his courage, this was almost 
theatrical : while, in general, the idea that Jesus, between the kiss of Judas, 
and the entrance of the crowd, which was certainly immediate, advanced towards 
the latter with questions and answers, throws into his demeanour a degree of 
hurry and precipitancy so ill suited to his circumstances, that the Evangelists 
can scarcely have meant such an inference to be drawn. It should therefore be 
acknowledged that neither of the two representations is designed as a supplement 
to the other,§ since each has a different conception of the manner in which 
Jesus was made known, and in which Judas was active in the affair. That Judas 
was <i>guide to them that took Jesus, </i><font FACE="Symbol">odhgoV toiV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">sullabousi ton Ihsoun</font> (Acts i. 16), all the 
Evangelists agree. But while according to the synoptical account the task of 
Judas includes not only the pointing out of the place, but also the 
distinguishing of the person by the kiss, John makes the agency of Judas end 
with the indication of the place, and represents him after the arrival on the 
spot as standing inactive among the crowd (<font FACE="Symbol">eisthkei de 
IoudaV</font>—<font FACE="Symbol">met</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">autwn,</font> 
v.5). Why John does not assign to Judas the task of personally indicating Jesus, 
it is </p>

<sup>
<p>§ </sup>how can Lücke explain the omission of the kiss of Judas in the Gospel 
of John from its having been too notorious a fact? and how can he adduce as an 
analogous instance the omission of the transaction between the betrayer and the 
Sanhedrim by John? for this, as something passing behind the scenes, might very 
well be left out, but by no means an incident which, like that kiss, happened so 
conspicuousby in the foreground and centre of the scene.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">739</p>
<p>easy to see because, namely, he would have Jesus appear, not as one delivered 
up but as delivering himself up, so that his sufferings may be manifested in a 
higher degree as undertaken voluntarily. We have only to remember how the 
earliest opponents of Christianity imputed the retirement of Jesus out of the 
city into the distant garden, as an ignominious flight from his enemies,* in 
order to find it conceivable that there arose among the Christians at an early 
period the inclination to transcend the common evangelical tradition in 
representing his demeanour on his arrest in the light of a voluntary 
self-resignation.</p>
<p>In the synoptists the kiss of Judas is followed by the cutting question ot 
Jesus to the traitor; in John, after Jesus has uttered the <font FACE="Symbol">
egw eimi</font>, <i>I am he, </i>it is stated that under the influence of these 
commanding words, the multitude who had come out to seize him went backward and 
fell to the ground, so that Jesus had to repeat his declaration and as it were 
encourage the people to seize him. Of late it has been denied that there was any 
miracle here: the impression of the personality of Jesus, it is said, acted 
psychologically on those among the crowd who had already often seen and heard 
Jesus; and in support of this opinion reference is made to the examples of this 
kind in the life</p>
<p>5 So says the Jew of Celsus, Orig. c. Cels. ii. 9: <i>When we, having 
convicted and condemned him, had determined that he should sufer punishment; 
concealing himself and endeavouring to escape, he experienced a most shameful 
capture.</p>
</i>
<p>of Marius, Coligny, and others.† But neither in the synoptical account, 
account, according to which there needed the indication of Jesus by the kiss, 
nor in that of John, according to which there needed the declaration of Jesus,
<i>I am he, </i>does Jesus appear to be known to the crowd, at least in such a 
manner as to exercise any profound influence over them; while the above examples 
only show that sometimes the powerful impression of a man’s personality has 
paralyzed the murderous hands of an individual or of a few, but not that a whole 
detachment of civil officers and soldiers has been made, not merely to draw 
back, but to fall to the ground. It answers no purpose for Lücke to make first a 
few fall down and then the whole crowd, except that of rendering it impossible 
to imagine the scene with gravity. Hence we turn to the old theologians, who 
here unanimously acknowledge a miracle. The Christ who by word of his mouth cast 
down the hostile multitude, is no other than he who according to <i>2 </i>Thess. 
ii. 8, shall consume the Antichrist <i>with the spirit of his mouth, </i>i.e. 
not the historical Christ, but the Christ of the Jewish and primitive Christian 
imagination. The author of the fourth gospel especially, who had so often 
remarked how the enemies of Jesus and their creatures were unable to lay hands 
on him, because his hour was not yet come (vii. 30, 32, 44 ff., viii. 20), had 
an inducement, now, when the hour was come, to represent the ultimately 
successful attempt as also failing at the first in a thoroughly astounding 
manner; especially as this fully accorded with the interest by which he is 
governed throughout the description of this whole scene—the demonstrating that 
the capture of Jesus was purely an act of his own free will When Jesus lays the 
soldiers prostrate by the power of his word he gives them a proof of what he 
could do, if to liberate himself were his object, and when he allows himself to 
be seized immediately after, this appears as the most purely voluntary 
self-sacrifice. Thus in the fourth gospel Jesus gives a practical proof of that 
power, which in the first he only expresses by words, when he says to one of his 
disciples: <i>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my FaTher, and he shall 
presently give me twelve legions oj angels </i>(v. 53)?</p>
<p>After this, the author of the fourth gospel very inappropriately holds up the 
solicitude which Jesus manifested that his disciples should not be taken captive 
with him, as a fulfilment of the declaration of Jesus (xvii. 12<i>), </i>that he 
had lost none of those intrusted to him by the Father; a declaration which was 
previously more suitably referred to the spiritual preservation of his 
disciples. As the next feature in the scene, all the Evangelists agree, that 
when the soldiers began to lay hands on Jesus, one of his disciples drew his 
sword, and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant, an act which met with a 
reproof from Jesus. Still Luke and John have each a peculiar trait. Not to 
mention that both particularize the ear as the right ear, while thcir two 
predecessor had left this point undetermined; the latter not only gives the name 
of the wounded servant, but states that the disciple who wounded him was Peter. 
Why the synoptists do not name Peter, it has been sought to explain in different 
ways. The supposition that they wished to avoid compromising the apostle, who at 
the time of the composition of their gospels was yet living,† belongs to the 
justly exploded fictions of an exegesis framed on the false principle of 
supplying conjecturally all those links in the chain of natural causation which 
are wanting in the gospels. That these Evangelists elsewhere for the most part 
omit names,‡ is too sweeping an accusation as regards Matthew, though he does 
indeed leave unnamed indifferent persons, such as Jairus, or Bartimæus; but that 
the real Matthew, or even the common evangelical tradition, thus early and 
generally should have lost the name from an anecdote of Peter, so thoroughly 
accordant with the part played by this apostle, can scarcely be considered very 
probable. To me, the reverse would be much more conceivable, namely, that the 
anecdote was originally current </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Lücke, 2, s. 597 f.; Obshausen, <i>2, s.</i> 435; Tholuck, s, 299. 
The reference to the murderer of Coligny is, however, unwarranted, as any one 
will find who will look into the book incorrectly cited by Tholuck <i>: Serrani 
commentatorium de statu religionis et reip. in regno Galliæ, </i>L. x. p. <i>32,

surprise in a writer who elsewhere (Glaubwürdigkeit, s. 437) speaks of the duke 
of Orleans, Louis Philippe’s father, as the brother of Louis XVI. How can a 
knowledge so diversified as that of Dr. Tholuck be always quite accurate.</p>

<p>‡ </sup>Ibid.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">740</p>
<p>without the mention of any name, (and why should not a less distinguished 
adherent of Jesus—for from the synoptists it is not necessarily to be inferred 
that it was one of the twelve—whose name was therefore the more readily 
forgotten, have had courage and rashness enough to draw his sword at that 
crisis?), but a later narrator thought such a mode of conduct particularly 
suited to the impetuous character of Peter, and hence ascribed it to him by a 
combination of his own. On this supposition, we need not appeal, in support of 
the possibility that John could know the servant’s name, to his acquaintance 
with the household of the high priest,* any more than to a peculiar acquaintance 
of Mark with some inhabitants of Jericho, in explanation of his obtaining the 
name of the blind man.</p>
<p>The distinctive trait in Luke’s account of this particular is, that Jesus 
heals the servant’s ear, apparently by a miracle. Olshausen here makes the 
complacent remark, that this circumstance best explains how Peter could escape 
uninjured—astonishment at the cure absorbed the general attention: while 
according to Paulus, Jesus by touching the wounded ear (<font FACE="Symbol">ayamenoV)</font><i>
</i>only meant to examine it, and then told what must be done for the purpose of 
healing (<font FACE="Symbol">iasato auton</font>)<i>; </i>had he cured it by a 
miracle there must have been some notice of the astonishment of the spectators. 
Such pains-taking interpretations are here especially needless, since the fact 
that Luke stands alone in giving the trait in question, together with the whole 
tenor of the scene, tells us plainly enough what opinion we are to form on the 
subject. Should Jesus, who had removed by his miraculous power so much suffering 
of which he was innocent, leave uncured suffering which one of his disciples out 
of attachment to him, and thus indirectly he himself, had caused? This must soon 
have been found inconceivable, and hence to the stroke of the sword of Peter was 
united a miraculous cure on the part of Jesus—the last in the evangelical 
history.</p>
<p>Here, immediately before he is led away, the synoptists place the 
remonstrance which Jesus addressed to those who had come to take him prisoner: 
that though, by his daily public appearance in the temple he had given the best 
opportunity for them to lay hands upon him, yet—a bad augury for the purity of 
their cause—they came to a distance to seek him with as many preparations, as 
against a thief? In the fourth gospel, he is made to say something similar to 
Annas, to whose inquiries concerning his disciples and his doctrine, he replies 
by referring him to the publicity of his entire agency, to his teaching in the 
temple and synagogue (xviii. 20 f.). Luke, as if he had gathered from both, that 
Jesus had said something of this kind to the high priest, and also at the time 
of his arrest, represents the chief priests and elders themselves as being 
present in the garden, and Jesus as here speaking to them in the above manner, 
which is certainly a mere blunder.† </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">741</p>
<p>According to the two first Evangelists, all the disciples now fled. Here Mark 
has the special particular, that a young man with a linen cloth cast about his 
naked body, when he was in danger of being seized, left the linen cloth and fled 
naked. Apart from the industrious conjectures of ancient and even modern 
expositors, as to who this young man was; this information of Mark’s has been 
regarded as a proof of the very early origin of this gospel, on the ground that 
so unimportant an anecdote, and one moreover to which no name is attached, could 
have no interest except for those who stood in close proximity to the persons 
and events.* But this inference is erroneous; for the above trait gives even to 
us, at this remote distance of time, a vivid idea of the panic and rapid flight 
of the adherents of Jesus, and must therefore have been welcome to Mark, from 
whatever source he may have received it, or how late soever he may have written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>§<i> </i>128. EXAMINATION OF JESUS BEFORE THE HIGH PRIEST.</p>
<p>From the place of arrest the synoptists state Jesus to have been led to the 
high priest, whose name, Caiaphas, is, however, only mentioned by Matthew; while 
John represents him as being led in the first instance to Annas, the 
father-in-law of the existing high priest; and only subsequently to Caiaphas 
(Matt. xxvi. 57 ff<i>. </i>parall. ; John xviii. 12 ff.). The important rank of 
Annas renders this representation of John as conceivable as the silence of the 
synoptists is explicable, on the ground that the ex-high priest had no power of 
deciding in this cause. But it is more surprising that, as must be believed from 
the first glance, the fourth Evangelist merely gives some details of the 
transaction with Annas, and appears entirely to pass by the decisive trial 
before the actual high priest, except that he states Jesus to have been led away 
to Caiaphas. There was no more ready expedient for the harmonists than the 
supposition, which is found e.g. in Euthymius, that John, in consistency with 
the supplementary character of his gospel, perserved the examination before 
Annas as being omitted by the synoptists, while he passed by that before 
Calaphas, because it was described with sufficient particularity by his 
predecessors.† This opinion, that John and the synoptists speak of two entirely 
distinct trials, has a confirmation in the fact that the tenor of the respective 
trials is totally different. In that which the synoptists describe, according to 
Matthew and Mark, the false witnesses first appear against Jesus; the high 
priest then asks him if he really pretends to be the Messiah, and on receiving 
an affirmative answer, declares him guilty of blasphemy, and worthy of death, 
whereupon follows maltreatment of his person. In the trial depicted by John, 
Jesus is merely questioned concerning his disciples and his doctrine, he appeals 
to the publicity of his conduct, </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Paulus, exeg. Handb. 3, b, s. 576.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Paulus, ut sup. s. 577<i>; </i>Olshausen, <i>2</i>, s. 244.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">742</p>
<p>and after having been maltreated for this reply by an attendant (<font FACE="Symbol">uphrethV</font>)<i>,
</i>is sent away without the passing of any sentence. That the fourth Evangelist 
should thus give no particulars concerning the trial before Caiaphas is the more 
surprising, since in the one before Annas, if it be this which he narrates, 
according to his own representation nothing was decided, and consequently the 
grounds for the condemnation of Jesus by the Jewish authorities, and the 
sentence itself, are altogether wanting in his gospel. To explain this by the 
supplementary object of John is to impute to him too irrational a mode of 
procedure; for if he omitted facts because the other Evangelists had already 
given them, without intimating that he did so purely for that reason, he could 
only reckon on introducing confusion, and entailing on himself the suspicion of 
having given a false narrative, He can hardly have had the opinion, that the 
trial before Annas was the principal one, and that therefore it was allowable to 
omit the other, since he reports no judgment as having been passed in the 
former; but if he knew the trial before Caiaphas to have been the principal one, 
and yet gave no more particular information concerning it, this also was a 
highly singular course for him to take.</p>
<p>Thus the very simplest view of the case seems at once to point to the attempt 
to discover in the account of the fourth gospel indications that it also is to 
be understood of the trial before Caiaphas. What affords the strongest 
presumption of the identity of the two trials is the identity of an incident 
concomitant with both, John as well as the synoptists making Peter deny Jesus 
during the trial detailed. It is further remarkable that after Annas has been 
spoken of, at v. 13, as the father-in-law of Caiaphas, there follows at V. 14, a 
more precise designation of Caiaphas as the author of the fatal counsel, 
recorded in John xi. 50, although apparently the Evangelist proceeds to narrate 
a trial held, not before Caiaphas, but before Annas. Moreover in the description 
of the trial itself, there is mention throughout of the palace and of questions 
from the <i>high priest, </i>a title which John nowhere else applies to Annas, 
but only to Caiaphas. But that in accordance with the above supposition, the 
Evangelist from v. 15, should be describing something which passed before 
Caiaphas, appears impossible from v. 24<i>, </i>for it is there first said that 
Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas, so that he must until then have been before Annas. 
With ready thought this difficulty was first met by removing the 24th verse to 
the place where it was wanted, namely, after v. 13, and laying the blame of its 
present too late position on the negligence of transcribers.* As, however, this 
transposition, being destitute of any critical authority, must appear an 
arbitrary and violent expedient for getting rid of the difficulty, it was next 
tried whether the statement in v. 24<i>, </i>without being actually moved from 
its place, might not receive such an interpretation as to come in point of sense 
after v. 13; i.e., the word </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Thus e.g. Erasmus, in loc.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">743</p>
<font FACE="Symbol">
<p>apesteilen </font>was taken as a pluperfect, and it was supposed that John 
intended here to supply retrospectively what he had forgotten to observe at v. 
13, namely, that Annas immediately sent Jesus to Caiaphas, so that the trial 
just described was conducted by the latter.* As the general possibility of such 
an <i>enallage temporum </i>is admissible, the only question is whether it be 
accordant with the style of the present writer, and whether it be intimated in 
the context. In the latter respect it is certainly true that if nothing 
important had occurred in the presence of Annas, the Evangelist, in annexing to 
his notice of the relationship of Annas to Caiaphas the more precise designation 
of the latter, might be drawn on to speak without further preface of the trial 
before Caiaphas, and might afterwards, by way of appendix, at some resting 
place, as here at the close of the transactions of the high priest with Jesus, 
intimate the transition which he had made. An accurate Greek writer certainly in 
this case, if he did not use the pluperfect, would at least have made evident 
the explanatory reference to what had preceded, by the addition of a
<font FACE="Symbol">gar</font><i> </i>to the aorist. Our Evangelist, however, in 
whom the characteristic of the Hellenistic writers to connect their propositions 
but loosely, in accordance with the genius of the Hebrew language, is very 
strongly marked, might perhaps have introduced that supplementary observation 
even without a particle, or, according to the ordinary reading, by
<font FACE="Symbol">oun</font>, which is not merely indicative that a subject is 
continued, but also that it is resumed.† If these considerations be held to 
establish that he also intended to narrate the trial before Caiaphas: it is 
clear from the aspect of his account taken by itself, as well as from the 
previous comparison with the synoptical one, that his narrative cannot be 
complete.</p>
<p>We turn, therefore, to the account of the synoptists, and among them also, 
namely, between the two first and the third, we find numerous divergencies. 
According to the former, when Jesus was brought into the palace of the high 
priest, the scribes and elders were already assembled, and while it was still 
night proceeded to hold a trial, in which first witnesses appeared, and then the 
high priest addressed to him the decisive question, on the answer to which the 
assembly declared him worthy of death (in John also the trial goes forward in 
the night, but there is no intimation of the presence of the great council). 
According to the representation of the third gospel, on the other hand, Jesus 
throughout the night is merely kept under guard in the high priest’s palace, and 
maltreated by the underlings; and when at the break of day the Sanhedrin 
assembles, no witnesses appear, but the high priest precipitates the sentence by 
the decisive question. Now, that in the depth of the night, while Judas was gone 
out with the guard, the members of the council should have assembled themselves 
for the reception of Jesus, might he regarded as improbable, and in so far, the 
preference might </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">744</p>
<p>be given to the representation of the third gospel, which makes them assemble 
at daybreak only:<sup>* </sup>were it not that Luke himself neutralizes this 
advantage by making the high priests and elders present at the arrest; a zeal 
which might well have driven</p>
<p>them straightway to assemble for the sake of accelerating the conclusion. But 
in the account of Matthew and Mark also there is this singularity, that after 
they have narrated to us the whole trial together with the sentence, they yet 
(xxvii. 1 and xv. 1) say : <i>when the morning was come, they took counsel, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">proiaV de genomenhV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">sumboulion 
elabon</font><i>, </i>thus making it appear, if not that the members of the 
Sanhedrim reassembled in the morning, which could hardly be, seeing that they 
had been together the whole night; yet that they now first came to a definite 
resolution against Jesus, though, according to these same Evangelists, this had 
already been done in the nocturnal council. † It may be said that to the 
sentence of death already passed in the night, was added in the morning the 
resolution to deliver Jesus to Pilate: but according to the then existing state 
of the law, this followed as a matter of course, and needed no special 
resolution. That Luke and John omit the production of the false witnesses, is to 
be regarded as a deficiency in their narrative. For from the coincidence of John 
ii. 19<i> </i>and Acts vi. 14 with Matthew and Mark, it is highly probably that 
the declaration about the destruction and rebuilding of the temple was really 
uttered by Jesus; while that that declaration should be used as an article of 
accusation against him on his trial was an almost necessary result. The absence 
of this weighty point in Luke, Schleiermacher explains by the circumstance, that 
the author of this passage in the third gospel had indeed followed the escort 
which conducted Jesus from the garden, but had with most others been excluded 
from the palace of the high priest, and consequently narrated what occurred 
there merely from hearsay. But, not to anticipate future points, the single 
trait of the cure of the servant’s ear suffices to preclude our attributing to 
the author of this portion of Luke’s gospel so close a proximity to the fact. It 
rather appears that the above declaration came to the third Evangelist under the 
form of an article of accusation against Stephen, instead of Jesus; while the 
fourth has it only as a declaration from Jesus, and not as an article of 
accusation against him. This subject having however necessarily come under our 
observation at an earlier point of our inquiry, it is needless to pursue it 
further here.‡ </p>
<p>When Jesus made no answer to the allegations of the witnesses, he was asked, 
according to the two first Evangelists, by the high priest,—in the third gospel, 
without the above cause, by the Sanhedrim,—whether he actually maintained that 
he was the Messiah (the Son of God)? To this question, according to the two 
former, he </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Thus Schieiermacher, über den Lukas, s. 295.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Schieiermacher, ut sup. ; comp. Fritzsche, in loc. Matth.</p>

<p>at once replies in the affirmative, in the words <font FACE="Symbol">su eipaV</font><i>, 
thou hast said, </i>and <font FACE="Symbol">egw eimi</font><i>, I am</i>, and 
adds that hereafter or immediately (<font FACE="Symbol">ap</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">arti</font>) 
they would see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the divine power, and 
coming in the clouds of heaven; according to Luke, on the other hand, he first 
declares that his answer will be of no avail, and then adds that hereafter the 
Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God; whereupon all 
eagerly ask: Art thou then the Son of God? and he replies in the affirmative. 
Thus Jesus here expresses the expectation that by his death he will at once 
enter into the glory of sitting as Messiah at the right hand of God, according 
to Ps. cx. 1, which he had already, Matt. xxii. 44, interpreted of the Messiah. 
For even if he at first perhaps thought of attaining his messianic glorification 
without the intervention of death, because this intervention was not presented 
to him by the ideas of the age; if it was only at a later period, and as a 
result of circumstances, that the foreboding of such a necessity began to arise 
and gradually to acquire distinctness in his mind; now, a prisoner, forsaken by 
his adherents, in the presence of the rancorously hostile Sanhedrim, it must, if 
he would retain the conviction of his messiahship, become a certainty to him, 
that he could enter into his messianic glorification by death alone. When, 
according to the two first Evangelists, Jesus adds to the <i>sitting on the 
right hand of power, </i>the <i>coming in the clouds of heaven, </i>he pródicts, 
as on an earlier occasion, his speedy advent, and in this instance he decidedly 
predicts it as a return. Olshausen maintains that the <font FACE="Symbol">ap</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">arti</font> 
of Matthew ought to be referred only to <font FACE="Symbol">kaqhmenon k. t. l.</font>, 
because it would not suit <font FACE="Symbol">ercomenon k. t. l.</font>, since 
it is not to be conceived that Jesus could then have represented himself as 
about to come in the clouds: a purely dogmatical difficulty, which does not 
exist in our point of view, but which cannot in any point of view warrant such 
an offence against grammatical interpretation as this of Olshausen. On the above 
declaration of Jesus, according to Matthew and Mark the high priest rends his 
clothes, declaring Jesus convicted of blasphemy, and the council pronounces him 
guilty of death; and in Luke also, all those assembled observe that now there is 
no need of any further witness, since the criminal declaration has been uttered 
by Jesus in their own hearing.*</p>
<p>To the sentence is then added in the two first Evangelists the maltreatment 
of Jesus, which John, who here mentions no sentence, represents as following the 
appeal of Jesus to the publicity of his work, while Luke places it before the 
trial; more probably because it was not any longer precisely known when this 
maltreatment occurred, than because it was repeated at various times and under 
various circumstances. In John the maltreatment is said to proceed from an <i>
attendant, </i><font FACE="Symbol">uphrethV</font><i>, </i>in Luke, from <i>the 
men that held Jesus, </i><font FACE="Symbol">andreV suneconteV ton I</font>.; in 
Mark, on the contrary, those who began to spit in the face of Jesus (<font FACE="Symbol">kai 
hrxanto tineV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">emptuein</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
autw</font>)<i> </i>must have been some of those (<font FACE="Symbol">panteV</font>) 
who had just before condemned </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">746</p>
<p>him, since he distinguishes the <font FACE="Symbol">uphretaV</font><i>, 
servants, </i>from them; and in Matthew also, who, without introducing a new 
nominative proceeds merely with <font FACE="Symbol">tote</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">hrxanto</font><i>, then began they, </i>it is plainly the 
members of the Sanhedrim themselves who descend to such unworthy conduct: which 
Schleiermacher justly considers improbable, and in so far prefers the 
representation of Luke to that of Matthew.* In John the maltreatment consists in 
a <i>blow on the cheek with the palm of the hand, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
rapisma</font><i>, </i>which an attendant gives Jesus on account of a supposed 
insolent answer to the high priest; in Matthew and Mark, in spitting on the face 
(<font FACE="Symbol">eneptusan eiV to proswpon autou</font>)<i>, </i>and blows 
on the head and cheek, to which it is added, in Luke also, that he was 
blindfolded, then struck on the face, and scoffingly asked to attest his 
messianic second sight by telling who was the giver of the blow.† According to 
Olshausen, the spirit of prophecy did not scorn to predict these rudenesses in 
detail, and at the same time to describe the state of mind which the Holy One of 
God opposed to the unholy multitude. He correctly adduces in relation to this 
scene Isa. 1. 6 f.; (LXX.): <i>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to 
them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting, </i>
etc., <font FACE="Symbol">ton nwton mou dedwka eiV mastigaV,</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">taV de siagonaV mou eiV rapismata, to de proswpon mou</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">ouk epestreya apo aiscunhV emptuomatwn k.t.l.</font>. (comp. 
Mic. iv. 14); and for the manner in which Jesus bore all this, the well-known 
passage Isa. liii. 7, where the servant of God is represented as enduring 
maltreatment in silence. But the interpretation of these passages in Isaiah as 
prophecies concerning the Messiah is equally opposed to the context in both 
instances : ‡ consequently the agreement of the result with these passages must 
either have been the effect of human design, or purely accidental. Now it is 
certain that the servants and soldiers in their maltreatment had not the 
intention of causing prophecies to be fulfilled in Jesus; and it will hardly be 
chosen to suppose that Jesus affected silence with this view; while to deduce 
from mere chance a coincidence which certainly, as Olshausen says, extends to 
minutiæ, is always unsatisfactory. Probable as it is from the rude manners of 
that age, that Jesus was maltreated when a prisoner, and moreover that amongst 
other things he received just such insults as are described by the Evangelists: 
it is yet scarcely to be denied, that their descriptions are modelled on 
prophecies which, when once Jesus appeared as a sufferer and maltreated person, 
were applied to him; and however consistent it may be with the character of 
Jesus that he should have borne this maltreatment patiently, and repelled 
improper questions by a dignified silence: the Evangelists would scarcely have 
noticed this so often and so solicitously, <sup>§</sup> if it had not been their 
intention thus to exhibit the fulfilment of Old Testament oracles.</p>
<p>§ 129. THE DENIAL OF PETER.</p>
<p>The two first Evangelists state, that at the moment in which Jesus was led 
away from the garden, all the disciples forsook him and fled; but in their 
accounts, as well as in those of Luke and John, Peter is said to have followed 
him at a distance, and to have obtained admission with the escort into the court 
of the high priest’s palace: while, according to the synoptists, it is Peter 
alone who gives this proof of courage and attachment to Jesus, which however 
soon enough issues in the deepest humiliation for him; the fourth Evangelist 
gives him John for a companion, and moreover represents the latter as the one 
who, by means of his acquaintance with the high priest, procures admittance for 
Peter into his palace; a divergency which, with the whole peculiar relation in 
which this gospel places Peter with respect to John, has been already 
considered.|| </p>
<p>According to all the Evangelists, it was in this <i>court, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">aulh</font>, that Peter, intimidated by the inauspicious 
turn in the fortunes of Jesus, and the high priest’s domestics by whom he was 
surrounded, sought to allay the repeatedly expressed suspicion that he was one 
of the followers of the arrested Galilean, by reiterated asseverations that he 
knew him not. But, as we have already intimated, in relation to the owner of 
this habitation, there exists an apparent divergency between the fourth gospel 
and the synoptists. In John, to judge from the first glance at his narrative, 
the first denial (xviii. 17) happens during the trial before Annas, since it 
stands after the statement that Jesus was led to Annas (v.<i> </i>13), and 
before the verse in which he is said to have been sent to Caiaphas (v. 24), and 
only the two further acts of denial (v. 25—27), in so far as they follow the 
last-named statement, and as immediately after them the delivery to Pilate is 
narrated (v. 28), appear in John also to have occurred during the trial before 
Caiaphas and in his palace. But to this supposition of a different locality for 
the first denial and the two subsequent ones, there is a hindrance in the 
account of the fourth gospel itself. After the mention of the first denial, 
which happened at the door of the palace (of Annas apparently), it is said that 
the night being cold the servants and officers had made a fire of coals, <i>and 
Peter stood with them and warmed himself, </i><font FACE="Symbol">hn de kai met</font>’
<font FACE="Symbol">autwn o PetroV estwV kai qermainimenoV</font><i> </i>(v. 
18). Now, when farther on, the narrative of the second and third denial is 
opened with nearly the same words: </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Ut sup.</p>

that Jesus named the person who maltreated him, whom he saw, but did not

<i>
<p>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself </i><font FACE="Symbol">hn de Simwn 
PetroV estwV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">kai qermainomenoV</font><i> </i>(v. 25): 
this cannot be understood otherwise than as an allusion to the previously 
noticed circumstances of the fire of coals, and of Peter’s standing by it to 
warm himself, and hence it must be inferred that the Evangelist intended to 
represent the second and third denial as having occurred by the same fire, 
consequently, on the above supposition, likewise in the house of Annas. It is 
true that the synoptists speak of a fire in the court of the palace of Caiaphas 
also (Mark v. 54.; Luke v. 55), at which Peter warmed himself (here, however, 
sitting, as in John standing): but it does not thence follow that John also 
imagined a similar fire to have been in the court of the actual high priest, and 
according to the supposition on which we have hitherto proceeded, he only 
mentions such a fire in the house of Annas. They who regard as too artificial an 
expedient the conjecture of Euthymius, that the dwellings of Annas and Caiaphas 
perhaps had a common court, and that consequently Peter could remain standing by 
the same fire after Jesus had been led away from the former to the latter, 
prefer the supposition that the second and third denial occurred, according to 
John, not after, but during the leading away of Jesus from Annas to Caiaphas.* 
Thus on the presupposition that John narrates a trial before Annas, the 
difference between the gospels in relation to the locality of the denial remains 
a total one; and in this irreconcilable divergency, some have decided in favour 
of John, on the ground that the scattered disciples had only fragmentary 
information concerning this scene,—that Peter himself being a stranger in 
Jerusalem did not know in which palace he had, to his misfortune, entered; but 
that he, and after him the first Evangelists, supposed the denials to have taken 
place in the court of Caiaphas; whereas John, from his more intimate 
acquaintance with the city and the high priest’s palace, was able to rectify 
this mistake.† But even admitting the incredible supposition that Peter 
erroneously believed himself to have denied Jesus in the palace of Caiaphas, 
still John, who in these days was in the society of Peter, would certainly at 
once have corrected his assertion, so that such an erroneous opinion could not 
have become fixed in his mind. Hence it might be preferred to reverse the 
attempt, and to vindicate the synoptists at the expense of John: were it not 
that the observations contained in the foregoing section (according to which 
John, after having merely mentioned that Jesus was led away to Annas, may speak 
from V. 15 of what occurred in the palace of Caiaphas), present a possible 
solution of this contradiction also.</p>
<p>In relation to the separate acts of denial, all the Evangelists agree in 
stating that there were three of them, in accordance with the prediction of 
Jesus; but in the description of the several instances they are at variance. 
First, as it regards place and persons; according </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Thus Schleiermacher, über den Lukas, s,<i> </i>289; Olshausen, <i>2,
</i>s. 445.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Thus Paulus, ut sup. s.<i> </i>577 f.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">749</p>
<p>to John the first denial is uttered on the very entrance of Peter, to <i>a 
damsel that kept the door, </i><font FACE="Symbol">paidiskh qurwroV </font>(v. 
17); in the synoptists, in the inner court, where Peter sat at the fire, to <i>a 
damsel, </i><font FACE="Symbol">paidiskh </font>(Matt. v. 69 f. parall.). The 
second takes</p>
<p>place, in John (v. <i>25), </i>and also in Luke, who at least notices no 
change of position (v. <i>58), </i>at the fire: in Matthew (v. 71) and Mark (v. 
68 ff.), after Peter was gone out into the <i>porch, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
pulwn,</font> <font FACE="Symbol">proaulion</font><i>; </i>further, in John it 
is made to several persons; in Luke, to one; in Matthew to another damsel than 
the one to whom he made the first denial; in Mark, to the same. The third denial 
happened, according to Matthew and Mark, who mention no change of place after 
the second, likewise in the porch; according to Luke and John, since they 
likewise mention no change of place, undoubtedly still in the inner court, at 
the fire; further, according to Matthew and Mark, to many bystanders, according 
to Luke to one: according to John, to one who happens to be a relative of the 
servant who had been wounded in the garden. As regards the conversation which 
passed on this occasion, the suspicious queries are at one time addressed to 
Peter himself at another to the bystanders, in order to point him out to their 
observation, and in the two first instances they are given by the different 
Evangelists with tolerable agreement, as merely expressing the opinion that he 
appeared to be one of the adherents of the man recently taken prisoner. But in 
the third instance, where the parties render a motive for their suspicion, they 
according to the synoptists mention his Galilean dialect as a proof of its 
truth; while in John the relative of Malchus appeals to his recollection of 
having seen Peter in the garden. Now the former mode of accounting for the 
suspicion is as natural as the second, together with the designation of the 
individual who adduced it as a relative of Malchus, appears artificial, and 
fabricated for the sake of firmly interweaving into the narrative the connexion 
of the sword-stroke given in the garden with the name of Peter.* In the answers 
of Peter there is the divergency, that according to Matthew he already the 
second time fortifies his denial by an oath, while according to Mark this is not 
the case until the third denial, and in the two other Evangelists this 
circumstance is not mentioned at all; moreover, Matthew, to preserve a 
gradation, adds on the third denial that Peter began to <i>curse </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">katanaqematizein</font>as well as to <i>swear </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">omnuein</font><i>, </i>a representation which when compared 
with the other gospels may appear exaggerated.</p>
<p>So to adjust these very differently narrated denials in such a manner that no 
Evangelist may be taxed with having given an incorrect or even a merely inexact 
account, was no light labour for the harmonists. Not only did the older, 
supranaturalistic expositors, such as Bengel, undertake this task, but even 
recently, Paulus has given himself much trouble to bring the various acts of 
denial recounted by the Evangelists into appropriate order, and thus to show </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">750</p>
<p>that they have a natural sequence. According to him, Peter denies the Lord,</p>
<p>1. Before the portress (1st denial in John);</p>
<p>2. Before several standing at the fire (2nd in John);</p>
<p>3. Before a damsel at the fire (1st in the synoptists);</p>
<p>4. Before one who has no particular designation (2nd in Luke);</p>
<p>5. On going out into the porch, before a damsel (2nd in Matthew and Mark. Out 
of this denial Paulus should in consistency have made two, since the damsel, who 
points out Peter to the bystanders, is according to Mark the same as the one in 
No. 3, but according to Matthew another);</p>
<p>6<i>. </i>Before the relative of Malchus (3rd in John);</p>
<p>7. Before one who professes to detect him by his Galilean dialect (3rd in 
Luke), and who forthwith</p>
<p>8. is seconded by several others, to whom Peter yet more strongly affirms 
that he knows not Jesus (3rd in Matthew and Mark).</p>
<p>Meanwhile by such a discrimination of the accounts out of respect to the 
veracity of the Evangelists, there was incurred the danger of impeaching the yet 
more important veracity of Jesus; for he had spoken of a threefold denial: 
whereas, on the plan of discrimination, according to the more or less consequent 
manner in which it is carried out, Peter would have denied Jesus from 6 to 9 
times. The old exegesis found help in the canon: <i>abnegatio ad plures plurium 
interrogationes facta uno paroxysmo, pro una numeratur.</i>† <sup><i></i></sup>
But even granting such a mode of reckoning admissible, still, as each of the 
four narrators for the most part notices a greater or less interval between the 
separate denials which he recounts; in each instance, denials related by 
different Evangelists, e.g. one narrated by Matthew, one by Mark, and so forth, 
must have occurred in immediate succession: a supposition altogether abitrary. 
Hence of late it has been a more favourite expedient to urge that the <i>thrice
</i><font FACE="Symbol">triV</font><i> </i>in the mouth of Jesus was only a 
round number intended to express a repeated denial, as also that Peter, once 
entangled in the confusion to a supposed necessity for falsehood, would be more 
likely to repeat his asseverations to 6 or 7 than merely to three inquirers.6<sup>‡</sup> 
But even if, according to Luke (v<i>. </i>59 f.), the interval from the first 
denial to the last be estimated as more than an hour, still such a questioning 
from all kinds of people on all sides, as well as the ultimate impunity of Peter 
amid so general a suspicion, is extremely improbable; and when expositors 
describe the state of mind of Peter during this scene as a complete 
stupefaction,<sup>§ </sup>they rather present the condition which befals the 
reader who has to arrange his ideas in such a crowd of continually repeated 
questions and answers having an identical meaning—like the incessant and lawless 
beating of a watch out of order. Olshausen has justly discarded the attempt to

<p><sup>§ </sup>Hess, Geschichte Jesu, 2, s. 343.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">751</p>
<p>remove such differences as a fruitless labour: nevertheless he, on the one 
hand, immediately proceeds to a forced reconciliation of the divergencies at 
some points of the narrative; and on the other, he maintains that there were 
precisely three denials, whereas Paulus again has evinced a more correct 
discernment in pointing out the premeditated effort of the Evangelists to show 
that the denial was threefold. What on that evening happened repeatedly (not, 
however, eight or nine times), was represented as having happened precisely 
three times, in order to furnish the closest fulfilment to the prediction of 
Jesus, which was understood in its strictest literality.</p>
<p>The termination, and as it were the catastrophe, of the whole history of the 
denial is, in all the narratives, according to the prediction of Jesus, 
introduced by the crowing of the cock. In Mark, it crows after the first denial 
(v. 68), and then a second time after the third; in the other Evangelists only 
once, after the last act of denial. While John concludes his account with this 
particular, Matthew and Mark proceed to tell us that on hearing the cock crow, 
Peter remembered the words of Jesus and wept; but Luke has an additional feature 
peculiar to himself, namely, that on the crowing of the cock Jesus turned and 
looked at Peter, whereupon the latter, remembering the prediction of Jesus, 
broke out into bitter weeping. Now according to the two first Evangelists, Peter 
was not in the same locality with Jesus: for he is said to have been <i>without
</i><font FACE="Symbol">exw </font>(Matt. v. 69) or <i>beneath </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">katw</font><i> </i>(Mark v. 66) <i>in the court </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">en th aulh</font>, and it is thus implied that Jesus was in 
an inner or upper apartment of the palace: it must be asked, therefore, how 
could Jesus hear the denial of Peter, and thereupon turn to look at him? In 
relation to the latter part of the difficulty, the usual answer is that Jesus 
was at that moment being led from the palace of Annas to that of Caiaphas, and 
looked significantly at the weak disciple in passing* But of such a removal of 
Jesus Luke knows nothing; and his expression, <i>the Lord turned and looked on 
Peter, </i><font FACE="Symbol">kai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">strafeiV o KurioV 
enebleye tw Petrw</font>, would not so well imply that Jesus looked at Peter in 
passing, as that he turned round to do so when standing; besides, the above 
supposition will not explain how Jesus became aware that his disciple had denied 
him, since in the tumult of this evening he could not well, as Paulus thinks, 
have heard when in a room of the palace the loud tones of Peter in the court. It 
is true that the express distinction of the places in which Jesus and Peter were 
is not found in Luke, and according to him Jesus also might have had to remain 
some time in the court: but first, the representation of the other Evangelists 
is here more probable: secondly, Luke’s own narrative of the denial does not 
previously create the impression that Jesus was in the immediate vicinity. But 
hypotheses for the explanation of that look of Jesus might have been spared, had 
a critical glance been directed to the origin of the </p>
<p>753</p>
<p>incident. The unaccountable manner in which Jesus, who in the whole previous 
occurrence is kept behind the scene, here all on a sudden casts a glance upon 
it, ought itself together with the silence of the other Evangelists, to have 
been taken as an indication of the real character of this feature in Luke’s </p>
<p>8 Paulus and Olshausen, in loc.; Schleiermacher, ut sup. 289 ; Neander, s. 
622<i>, </i>Anm.</p>
<p>narrative. When also it is added, that as Jesus looked on Peter the latter 
remembered the words which Jesus had earlier spoken to him concerning his coming 
denial; it might have been observed that the glance of Jesus is nothing else 
than the sensible image of Peter’s remorseful recollection. The narrative of 
John, which is in this case the simplest, exhibits the fulfilment of the 
prediction of Jesus objectively, by the crowing of the cock; the two first 
Evangelists add to this the subjective impression, which this coincidence made 
on Peter; while Luke renders this again objective, and makes sorrowful 
remembrance of the words of the master, with the force of a penetrating glance, 
pierce the inmost soul of the disciple.† </p>

<p>§ </i>130. THE DEATH OF THE BETRAYER.</p>
<p>On hearing that Jesus was condemned to death, Judas, according to the first 
gospel (xxvii. 3 ff.),<i> </i>was smitten with remorse, and hastened to the 
chief priests and elders to return to them the thirty pieces of silver, with the 
declaration that he had betrayed an innocent person. When however the latter 
scornfully retorted that on him alone rested all responsibility for that deed, 
Judas, after casting down the money in the temple, impelled by despair, went 
away and hanged himself. Hereupon the Sanhedrists, holding it unlawful to put 
the money returned by Judas into the treasury, since it was the price of blood, 
bought with it a potter’s field as a burying place for strangers. To this 
particular the Evangelist appends two remarks: first, that from this mode of 
purchase, the piece of ground was called the <i>field of blood </i>up to his 
time : and secondly, that by this course of things an ancient prophecy was 
fulfilled.—The rest of the Evangelists are silent concerning the end of Judas ; 
but on the other hand we find in the Acts of the, Apostles (1. 16 ff.) some 
information on this subject which in several points diverges from that of 
Matthew. Peter, when about to propose the completion of the apostolic number by 
the choice of a new colleague, thinks proper, by way of preliminary to remind 
his hearers of the manner in which the vacancy in the apostolic circle had 
arisen, i.e. of the treachery and the end of Judas; and in relation to the 
latter he says, that the betrayer purchased himself a field with the reward of 
his crime, but fell headlong, and burst asunder in the midst, so that all his 
bowels gushed out, which being known in all Jerusalem, the piece of ground was 
called <font FACE="Symbol">akeldama</font><i> </i>i.e. <i>the field of blood.
</i>In addition to this, the narrator makes Peter observe that these occurrences 
were a fulfilment of two passages in the Psalms.</p>
<p>Between these two accounts there exists a double divergency: the one 
pertaining to the manner of the death of Judas, the other to the statement when 
and by whom the piece of ground was bought. As regards the former, Matthew 
declares that Judas laid violent hands on himself out of remorse and despair: 
whereas in the Acts nothing is saidof remorse on the part of the traitor, and 
his death has not the appearance of suicide, but of an accident, or more 
accurately, of a calamity decreed by heaven as a punishment; further, in Matthew 
he inflicts death on himself by the cord : according to the representation of 
Peter, it is a fall which puts an end to his life by causing a horrible rupture 
of the body.</p>
<p>How active the harmonists of all times have been in reconciling these 
divergencies, may be seen in Suïcer <sup>‡</sup> and Kuinöl: here we need only 
briefly adduce the principal expedients for this purpose. As the divergency lay 
chiefly in the words <font FACE="Symbol">aphgxato</font>, <i>he hanged himself
</i>in Matthew, and <font FACE="Symbol">prhnhV genomenoV</font>,<i> falling 
headlong, </i>in Luke, the most obvious resource was to see whether one of these 
expressions could not be drawn to the side of the other. This has been tried 
with <font FACE="Symbol">aphgxato</font> in various ways; this word being 
interpreted at one time as signifying only the torments of a guilty conscience,§ 
at another, a disease consequent on these,<sup>||</sup> at another, any death 
chosen out of melancholy and despair ; <sup>¶</sup> and to this it has been 
thought that the statement <font FACE="Symbol">prhnhV genomenoV k. t. l.</font><i>
</i>in the Acts added the more precise information, that the kind of death to 
which Judas was driven by an evil conscience and despair was precipitation from 
a steep eminence. Others on the contrary have sought to accommodate the meaning 
of <font FACE="Symbol">prhnhV genomenoV </font>to <font FACE="Symbol">aphgxato</font>, 
understanding it merely to express as a circumstance what <font FACE="Symbol">
aphgxato</font> expresses as an act: and accordingly maintaining that if the 
latter should be rendered <i>se suspendit, </i>the former should be translated 
by <i>suspensus.<sup>* </sup></i>From repugnance to the obvious violence of this 
attempt, others, sparing the natural meaning of the expressions on both sides, 
have reconciled the divergent accounts by the supposition that Matthew narrates 
an earlier, the author of the Acts a later, stage of the events which marked the 
end of Judas. Some of the ancient commentators indeed separated these two stages 
so widely as to see in Matthew’s statement (<font FACE="Symbol">aphgxato) </font>
only an unsuccessful attempt at self-destruction, which from the bough whereon 
he suspended himself having broken, or from some other cause, Judas outlived, 
until the judgment of heaven overtook him in the <font FACE="Symbol">prhnhV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">genomenoV</font><i>, falling headlong.</i><sup>†</sup><i>

<p>narrate the last moments of the traitor: the two epochs, the account of which 
is supposed to be respectively given by Matthew and the Acts, have in later 
times been placed in closer proximity, and it has been held that Judas attempted 
to hang himself to a tree on an eminence, but as the rope gave way or the branch 
broke, he was precipitated into the valley over steep cliffs and sharp bushes, 
which lacerated his body.* The author of a treatise on the fate of Judas in 
Schmidt’s Bibliothek<sup>† </sup>has already remarked as a surprising 
circumstance, how faithfully according to this opinion, the two narrators have 
shared the information between them: for it is not the case that one gives the 
less precise statement, the other the more precise; but that one of them 
narrates precisely the first part of the incident without touching on the 
second, the other, the second without intruding on the first; and Hase justly 
maintains that each narrator knew only the state of the fact which he has 
presented, since otherwise he could not have omitted the other half.<sup>‡</sup>
</p>
<p>After thus witnessing the total failure of the attempts at reconciliation in 
relation to the first difference; we have now to inquire whether the other, 
relative to the acquisition of the piece of ground, can be more easily adjusted. 
It consists in this : according to Matthew, it is the members of the Sanhedrim 
who, after the suicide of Judas, purchase a field with the money which he had 
left behind (from a potter moreover—a particular which is wanting in the Acts); 
whereas, according to the Acts, Judas himself purchases the piece of ground, and 
on this very spot is overtaken by sudden death; and from this difference there 
results another, namely, that according to the latter account, it was the blood 
of the betrayer shed on the piece of ground, according to the former, the blood 
of Jesus cleaving to the purchase money, which caused the ground to be named <i>
the field of blood, </i><font FACE="Symbol">agroV </font>or <font FACE="Symbol">
xwrion</font> <font FACE="Symbol">aimatoV</font>. Now here Matthew’s manner of 
expressing himself is so precise, that it cannot well be twisted so as to favour 
the other narrative; but the word <font FACE="Symbol">ekthsato </font><i>(he 
purchased or acquired) </i>in the Acts presents inviting facilities for its 
adaptation to Matthew. By the reward of treachery, Judas acquired a field—such, 
it is said, is the meaning in the Acts—not immediately, but mediately; since by 
returning the money he gave occasion for the purchase of a piece of ground; not 
for himself, but for the Sanhedrim or the public good.|| But however numerous 
the passages adduced in which <font FACE="Symbol">ktasqai </font>has the 
signification: to acquire for another, still in such instances it is necessary 
that the other party for whom one acquires should be specified or intimated, and 
when this is not the case, as in the passage in the Acts, it retains the </p>

in Matth. 747 f.; Winer, b. Realw. Art. Judas, and with some indecision 
Olshausen, 2, s. <i>455 </i>f. Even Fritzsche is become so weary on the long way 
to these last chapters of Matthew, that he contents himself with this 
reconciliation, and, on the presupposition of it, maintains that the two 
accounts concur <i>amicissime.</p>

<sup>
<p>|| </sup>Vid. Kuinöl, in Matth., p. 748.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">755</p>
<p>original meaning: to acquire for one’s self.* This Paulus felt, and hence 
gave the facts the following turn: the terrible fall of Judas into a lime pit 
was the cause of this piece of ground being purchased by the Sanhedrim, and thus 
Peter might very well say of Judas ironically, that in death by the fall of his 
corpse he had appropriated to himself a fine property.<sup>†</sup> But in the 
first place this interpretation is in itself strained; and in the second, the 
passage cited by Peter from the Psalms: <i>let his habitation be desolate, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">genhqhtw h epauliV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">autou erhmoV
</font>shows that he thought of the piece of ground as the real property of 
Judas, and as being judicially doomed to desolation as the scene of his death.</p>
<p>According to this, neither the one difference nor the other admits of a 
favourable reconciliation; indeed the existence of a real divergency was 
admitted even by Salmasius, and Hase thinks that he can explain this 
discrepancy, without endangering the apostolic origin of the two statements, 
from the violent excitement of those days, in consequence of which only the 
general fact that Judas committed suicide was positively known, and concerning 
the more particular circumstances of the event, various reports were believed. 
But in the Acts nothing is said of suicide, and that two apostles, Matthew and 
Peter (if the first gospel be supposed to proceed from the former, the discourse 
in the Acts from the latter), should have remained so entirely in the dark 
concerning the death of their late colleague, a death which took place in their 
immediate vicinity, that one of them represented him as dying by accident, the 
other voluntarily, is difficult to believe. That therefore only one of the two 
accounts can be maintained as apostolic, has been correctly perceived by the 
author of the above-mentioned treatise in Schmidt’s Bibliothek. And in choosing 
between the two he has proceeded on the principle that the narrative the least 
tending to glorification is the more authentic; whence he gives the preference 
to the account in the Acts before that in the first gospel, because the former 
has not the glorifying circumstances of the remorse of Judas, and his confession 
of the innocence of Jesus. But, it is ever the case with two contradictory 
narratives, not only that if one stands it excludes the other, but also that if 
one falls it shakes the other: hence, if the representation of the facts which 
is attested by the authority of the Apostle Matthew be renounced, there is no 
longer any warrant for the other, which professedly rests on the testimony of 
the Apostle Peter.</p>
<p>If then we are to treat the two narratives on the same footing, namely as 
legends, with respect to which it is first to be discovered how far their 
historical nucleus extends, and how far they consist of traditional deposits; we 
must, in order to be clear on the subject, consider the data which form the 
roots of the two narratives. Here we find one which is common to both, with two 
others of which </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Vid. Schmidt’s Biblioth., ut sup. s. 251<i> </i>f.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Paulus, 3, b, s.<i> </i>457 f. ; Fritzsche, p. 799.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">756</p>
<p>each has one peculiarly to itself. The datum common to both narratives is, 
that there was in Jerusalem a piece of ground which was called <i>the field of 
blood</i> <font FACE="Symbol">agroV </font>or <font FACE="Symbol">cwrion aimatoV</font>, 
or in the original tongue, according to the statement of the Acts,
<font FACE="Symbol">akeldama</font>. As this information is concurrently given 
by two narratives in other respects totally divergent, and as, besides, the 
author of the first gospel appeals to the actual practice of his day in proof 
that the field was called by this name: we cannot well doubt the existence of a 
piece of ground so named. That it really had a relation to the betrayer of Jesus 
is less certain, since our two narratives give different accounts of this 
relation: the one stating that Judas himself bought the property, the other that 
it was not purchased until after his death, with the thirty pieces of silver. We 
can therefore draw no further conclusion than that the primitive Christian 
legend must have early attributed to that field of blood a relation to the 
betrayer. But the reason wherefore this relation took various forms is to be 
sought in the other datum from which our narratives proceed, namely, in the Old 
Testament passages, which the authors cite (from different sources, however), as 
being fulfilled by the fate of Judas.</p>
<p>In the passage of the Acts, Ps. lxix. <i>25, </i>and Ps. cix. 8, are quoted 
in this manner. The latter is a psalm which the first Christians from among the 
Jews could not avoid referring to the relation of Judas to Jesus. For not only 
does the author, alleged to be David, but doubtless a much later individual,* 
dilate from the opening of the psalm on such as speak falsely and insidiously 
against him, and return him hatred for his love, but from v. 6, where the curses 
commence, he directs himself against a particular person, so that the Jewish 
expositors thought of Doeg, David’s calumniator with Saul, and the Christians 
just as naturally of Judas. From this psalm is gathered the verse which, 
treating of the transfer of one office to another, appeared perfectly to suit 
the case of Judas. The other psalm, it is true, speaks more vaguely of such as 
hate and persecute the author without cause, yet this also is<i> </i>ascribed to 
David, and is so similar to the other in purport and style, that it might be 
regarded as its parallel, and if curses might be applied to the betrayer out of 
the former, they might be so out of the latter.<sup>† </sup>Now if Judas had 
actually bought with the wages of his treachery a piece of land, which from 
being the scene of his horrible end, subsequently remained waste: it was a 
matter of course to refer to him precisely those passages in this psalm which 
denounce on the enemies the desolation of their <i>habitation </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">epauliV</font><i>. </i>As, however, from the divergency of 
Matthew, the fact that Judas himself bought that piece of ground and came to his 
end upon it, is doubtful: while it can scarcely be supposed that the piece of 
land on which the betrayer of Jesus met his end would be so abhorrent to the 
Jews </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Vid. De Wette, in loc.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>In other parts of the N. T. also we find passages from this psalm 
messianically applied:</p>
<p>as v. 4, John xv. 25, v.<i> </i>9; John ii. 17; and John xix. 28 f., probably 
v. 21.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">757</p>
<p>that they would let it lie waste as a land of blood; it is more probable that 
this name had another origin no longer to be discovered, and was interpreted by 
the Christians in accordance with their own ideas; so that we must not derive 
the application of the passage in the Psalms, and the naming of that waste piece 
of land, from an actual possession of it by Judas, but on the contrary, we must 
refer to those two causes the existence of the legend, which ascribes such a 
possession to Judas. For if the two psalms in question were once applied to the 
betrayer, and if in one of them the desolation of his <font FACE="Symbol">
epauliV </font>(LXX.) was denounced, he must have previously been in possession 
of such an <font FACE="Symbol">epauliV</font><i>, </i>and this it was thought, 
he would probably have purchased with the reward of his treason. Or rather, that 
out of the above psalms the desolation of the <font FACE="Symbol">epauliV</font> 
was a particular specially chosen, appears to have been founded on the natural 
presupposition, that the curse would be chiefly manifested in relation to 
something which he had acquired by the wages of his iniquity; added to the 
circumstance that among the objects anathematized in the psalm, the one most 
capable of being bought was the <font FACE="Symbol">epauliV</font><i>. </i>This 
conception of the facts was met in the most felicitous manner by the
<font FACE="Symbol">akeldama</font> lying near Jerusalem, which, the less was 
known of the origin of its name and of the horror attached to it, might the more 
easily be applied by the primitive Christian legend to its own purposes, and 
regarded as the <i>desolate habitation, </i><font FACE="Symbol">epauliV 
hrhmwmenh</font><i>, </i>of the betrayer.</p>
<p>Instead of these passages from the Psalms, the first gospel cites as being 
fulfilled by the last acts of Judas, a passage which it attributes to Jeremiah, 
but to which nothing corresponding is to be found except in Zech. xi. 12 f., 
whence it is now pretty generally admitted that the Evangelist substituted one 
name for the other by mistake.* How Matthew might be led by the fundamental idea 
of this passage-—an unreasonably small price for the speaker in the prophecy—to 
an application of it to the treachery of Judas, who for a paltry sum had as it 
were sold his master, has been already shown.<sup>† </sup>Now the prophetic 
passage contains a command from Jehovah to the author of the prophecy, to cast 
the miserable sum with which he had been paid, into the house of the Lord, and 
also [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>el-hayyotser</b>, which, it is added, was done. 
The person who casts down the money is in the prophecy the same with the 
speaker, and consequently with him who is rated at the low price, because the 
sum here is not purchase money but hire, and hence is received by the person so 
meanly estimated, who alone can cast it away again: in the application of the 
Evangelist, on the contrary, the sum being considered as purchase money, another 
than the one so meanly estimated was to be thought of as receiving and casting 
away the sum. If the one sold for so paltry a price was Jesus: he who received 
the money and finally rejected it could be no other than his betrayer. Hence it 
is said of the latter, that <i>he cast down the pieces of silver</p>
</i><sup>
<p>* </sup>Still for other conjectures see Kuinöl, in loc.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>§ 119.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">758</p>
<i>
<p>in the temple </i><font FACE="Symbol">en tw naw </font>corresponding to the 
phrase [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>wa’ashliyk ‘otho</b> in the prophetic passage, 
although these very words happen to be absent from the extremely mutilated 
citation of Matthew. But in apposition to the [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>beyth 
yhowah</b> wherein the money was cast, there stood besides [<i>Heb. letters</i>]
<b>el-hayyotser.</b> The LXX. translates: <font FACE="Symbol">eiV to</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">cwveuthrion</font><i>, into the melting furnace; </i>now, it 
is with reason conjectured that the pointing should be altered thus:</p>
<p>and the word rendered: <i>into the treasury; </i>* the author of our gospel 
adhered to the literal translation by <font FACE="Symbol">kerameuV </font><i>
potter. </i>But what the potter had to do here,—why the money should be given to 
him, must at first have been as incomprehensible to him as it is to us when we 
adhere to the common reading. Here however there occurred to his recollection 
the field of blood, to which, as we gather from the Acts, the Christian legend 
gave a relation to Judas, and hence resulted the welcome combination, that it 
was probably that field for which the thirty pieces of silver were to be given 
to the <i>potter. </i>As, however, it was impossible to conceive the potter as 
being in the temple when receiving the money, and yet according to the prophetic 
passage the pieces of silver were cast into the temple: a separation was made 
between the casting into the temple and the payment to the potter. If the former 
must be ascribed to Judas, if he had thus once cast away the money, he himself 
could no longer purchase the piece of ground from the potter, but this must be 
done by another party, with the money which Judas had cast away. Who this party 
must be followed of course: if Judas gave up the money, he would give it up to 
those from whom he had received it; if he cast it into the temple, it would fall 
into the hands of the rulers of the temple: thus in both ways it would revert to 
the Sanhedrim. The object of the latter in purchasing the ground was perhaps 
drawn from the use to which that waste place was actually appropriated. Lastly, 
if Judas cast away again the reward of his treachery, this, it must be inferred, 
could only be out of remorse. To make Judas manifest remorse, and thus win from 
the traitor himself a testimony to the innocence of Jesus, was as natural to the 
conception of the primitive Christian community, as to convert Pilate, and to 
make Tiberius himself propose in the Roman senate the deification of Christ,<sup>†</sup> 
But how would the remorse of Judas further manifest itself? A return to the 
right on his part, was not only unattested by any facts, but was besides far too 
good a lot for the traitor: hence repentance must have become in him despair, 
and he must have chosen the end of the well-known traitor in the history of 
David, </p>

<p>A tradition referred to Papias appears to be allied to the narrative in the 
Acts rather than to that of Matthew. (Ecumenius, quoting the above collector of 
traditions, says, that Judas, as an awful example of impiety, had his body 
distended to such a degree, that a space where a chariot could pass was no 
longer sufficiently wide for him, and that at last being crushed by a chariot, 
he burst asunder and all his bowels were pressed out.* The latter statement 
doubtless arose from a misconstruction of the ancient legend; for the chariot 
was not originally brought into immediate contact with the body of Judas, but 
was merely used as a measure of his size, and this was afterwards erroneously 
understood as if a chariot in passing had crushed the swollen body of Judas. 
Hence, not only in Theophylact and in an ancient <i>Scholium.</i><sup>† </sup>
without any distinct reference to Papias, but also in a <i>Catena </i>with an 
express citation of his <font FACE="Symbol">exhghseiV</font><i>, </i>we actually 
find the fact narrated without that addition.<sup>‡</sup> The monstrous swelling 
of Judas, spoken of in this passage, might, it is supposed, originally he only 
an explanation of the displacing and protrusion of the viscera, and in like 
manner the dropsy into which Theophylact represents him as falling might be 
regarded as an explanation of this swelling: when, however, in Ps. cix., applied 
in the Acts to Judas, amongst other maledictions, we read: [<i>Heb. letters</i>]
<b>watabo’ (qalalah) kammayim bqirbo</b> LXX: <font FACE="Symbol">eishlqen</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">(h</font> <font FACE="Symbol">katara) wsei udwr eiV ta

(v. 18): it appears possible that the <i>dropsical disease,</i><font FACE="Symbol">nosoV 
uderikh</font>)<i>, </i>may have been also taken from this passage; as also one 
of the features in the monstrous description which Papias gives of the condition 
of Judas, namely, that from the enormous swelling of his eyelids he could no 
longer see the light of day, might remind us of </p>

<sup>
<p>† </sup>Vid. sup.</p>
<sup>
<p>‡ </sup>In Münter’s Fragm. Patr. 1, p. 27 ff. For the rest the passage is of 
very similar tenor with that of Œcumenius, and is partly an exaggeration of it:
<i>Papias, the disciple of John, gives a clearer account of this (in the fourth 
section of his exegesis of our Lord’s words) as follows: Judas moved about in 
this world a terrible example of impiety, being swollen in body to such a degree 
that where a chariot could easily pass he was not able to find a passage, even 
for the bulk of his head. His eyelids, they say, were so swelled out that he 
could not see the light, nor could his eyes be made visible even by the 
physician’s dioptra,</i> etc. <i>After suffering many torments and Judgments,

enumerated: <i>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not</i>,
<font FACE="Symbol">skotisqhtwsan oi</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ofqalmoi autwn 
tou mh blepein,</font> a hindrance to sight, which when once the swollen body of 
Judas was presupposed, must necessarily assume the form of a swelling up of the 
eyelids. If then the tradition which is allied to the account in Acts i. 
developed its idea of the end of Judas chiefly in correspondence with the ideas 
presented in these two psalms; and if in that passage of the Acts itself the 
account of the connexion of Judas with the piece of ground is derived from the 
same source: it is no farfetched conjecture that what is said in the Acts 
concerning the end of the betrayer may have had a similar origin. That he died 
an early death may be historical; but even if not so, in Psalm cix. in the very 
same verse (v. 8), which contains the transfer of the office,
<font FACE="Symbol">episkoph, </font>to another, an early death is predicted for 
the betrayer in the words: <i>Let his days be few, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
genhqhtwsan ai hmerai autou oligai</font><i>, </i>and it might also be believed 
that the death by falling headlong also was gathered from Ps. lxix. 22, where it 
is said: <i>Let their table became a snare before them,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">
genhqhtw h trapeza autwn</font>—<font FACE="Symbol">eiV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">skandalon [</font><i>Heb. letters</i><font FACE="Symbol">]
</font>(<b>lmoqesh</b>)<i>.</p>
</i>
<p>Thus we scarcely know with certainty concerning Judas even so much as that he 
came to a violent and untimely death, for if, as was natural, after his 
departure from the community of Jesus, he retired, so far as the knowledge of 
its members was concerned, into an obscurity in which all historical information 
as to his further fate was extinguished: the primitive Christian legend might 
without hindrance represent as being fulfilled in him all that the prophecies 
and types of the Old Testament threatened to the false friend of the Son of 
David, and might even associate the memory of his crime with a well-known 
desecrated place in the vicinity of Jerusalem.* </p>
<p>§ 131. JESUS BEFORE PILATE AND HEROD.</p>
<p>According to all the Evangelists it was in the morning when the Jewish 
magistrates, after having declared Jesus worthy of death,<sup>† </sup>caused him 
to be led away to the Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate (Matt. xxvii. 1 ff<i>.
</i>parall.; John xviii. 28). According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus was bound 
preparatory to his being conducted before Pilate, according to John xviii. I2, 
immediately on his arrest in the garden; Luke says nothing of his being bound. 
To this measure of sending him to Pilate they were compelled, according to John 
xviii. 31, by the circumstance that the Sanhedrim was deprived of the authority 
to execute the punishment of death (without the concurrence of the Roman 
government) :<sup>‡</sup> but at all events the Jewish rulers must in this 
instance have been anxious to call in the agency of the Romans, since only their 
power could afford security against an <i>uproar among the people</i>
<font FACE="Symbol">qoruboV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">en tw law</font><i>, </i>
which the former feared as a result of the execution of Jesus during the feast 
time (Matt. xxvi. 5 parall.).</p>
<p>Arrived at the Prætorium, the Jews, according to the representation of the 
fourth gospel, remained without, from fear of Levitical defilement, but Jesus 
was led into the interior of the building: so that Pilate must alternately have 
come out when he would speak to the Jews, and have gone in again when he 
proceeded to question Jesus (xviii. 28<i> </i>ff.). The synoptists in the sequel 
represent Jesus as in the same locality with Pilate and the Jews, for in them 
Jesus immediately hears the accusations of the Jews, and answers them in the 
presence of Pilate. Since they, as well as John, make the condemnation take 
place in the open air (after the condemnation they represent Jesus as being led 
into the Prætorium, Matt. xxvii. 27<i>, </i>and Matthew, like John, xix. 13, 
describes Pilate ascending the <i>judgment seat </i><font FACE="Symbol">bhma</font><i>,
</i>which according to Josephus<sup>§ </sup>stood in the open air), without 
mentioning any change of place in connexion with the trial: they apparently 
conceived the whole transaction to have passed on the outer place, and supposed, 
in divergency from John, that Jesus himself was there.</p>
<p>The first question of Pilate to Jesus is according to all the gospels: <i>Art 
thou the king of the Jews?</i><font FACE="Symbol">su ei o basileuV twn Ioudaiwn</font>, 
i.e. the Messiah? In the two first Evangelists this question is not introduced 
by any accusation on the part of the Jews (Matt. v. 11 ; Mark v. <i>2); </i>in 
John, Pilate, stepping out of the Prætorium, asks the Jews what accusation they 
have to bring against Jesus (xviii. 29), on which they insolently reply: <i>If 
he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee: </i>an 
answer by which they could not expect to facilitate their obtaining from the 
Roman a ratification of their sentence,|| but only to embitter him. After 
Pilate, with surprising mildness, has rejoined that they may take him and judge 
him according to their law— apparently not supposing a crime involving death—and 
the Jews have opposed to this permission their inability to administer the 
punishment of death: the procurator re-enters and addresses to Jesus the 
definite question: </p>

<sup>
<p>† </sup>According to Babl. Sanhedrin, ap. Lightfoot, p. 486, this mode of 
procedure would have been illegal. It is there said <i>:Judicia de capitalibus 
finiunt eodem die si sint ad absolutionem; si vero sint ad damnationem, 
finiuntur die sequente.</p>
</i><sup>
<p>‡ </sup>Besides this passage of John: , <font FACE="Symbol">hmin ouk exestin 
apokteinai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">oudena</font><i> , it is not lawful for us 
to put any man to death, </i>there is no other authority for the existence of 
this state of things than an obscure and variously interpreted tradition, Avoda 
Zara f. viii. 2 (Lightfoot, p. 1123 f<i>.): Rabh Cahna dicit, curn aegrotaret R. 
Isinael bar Jose, miserunt ad eum, dicentes: dic nobi, o Domine, duo aut tria, 
quæ aliquando dixisti nobis nomine patris tui. Dicit iis —quadraginta annis ante 
excidium templi migravit Synedrium et sedit in tabernis. Quid sibi vult haec 
traditio? Rabh Isaac, bar Abdimi dicit: non judicarunt judicia mulctativa. Dixit 
R. Nathman bar Isaac: ne dicat, quod non judicarunt judicia mulctativa, sed quod 
non judicarunt judicia capitalia. </i>With this may be compared moreover the 
information given by Josephus, Antiq. xx. ix. 1, that it <i>was not lawful for 
Ananus </i>(the high priest) <i>to assemble the Sanhedrim without the consent of 
the procurator. </i>On the other hand the execution of Stephen (Acts vii.) 
without the sanction of the Romans might seem to speak to the contrary; but this 
was a tumultuary act, undertaken perhaps in the confidence that Pilate was 
absent. Compare on this point Lücke, 2, s. 631 ff.</p>
<sup>
<p>§ </sup>De bell. Jud. II. ix. 3.</p>
<sup>
<p>|| </sup>As Lücke supposes, s. 631.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">762</p>
<i>
<p>Art thou the king of the Jews? </i>which thus here likewise has no suitable 
introduction. This is the case only in Luke, who first adduces the accusations 
of the Sanhedrists against Jesus, that he stirred up the people and encouraged 
them to refuse tribute to Cæsar, giving himself out to be <i>Christ a king;
<font FACE="Symbol">Criston basileian </font></i>(xxiii. <i>2).</p>
</i>
<p>If in this manner the narrative of Luke enables us to understand how Pilate 
could at once put to Jesus the question whether he were the king of the Jews; it 
leaves us in all the greater darkness as to how Pilate, immediately on the 
affirmative answer of Jesus, could without any further inquiries declare to the 
accusers that he found no fault in the accused, He must first have ascertained 
the grounds or the want of grounds for the charge of exciting the populace, and 
also have imformed himself as to the sense in which Jesus claimed the title of
<i>king of the Jews, </i>before he could pronounce the words: <i>I find no fault 
in this man. </i>In Matthew and Mark, it is true, to the affirmation of Jesus 
that he is the king of the Jews is added his silence, in opposition to the 
manifold accusations of the Sanhedrists—a silence which surprises Pilate: and 
this is not followed by a precise declaration that no fault is to be found in 
Jesus, but merely by the procurator’s attempt to set Jesus at liberty by 
coupling him with Barabbas; still what should move him even to this attempt does 
not appear from the above gospels. On the other hand, this point is sufficiently 
clear in the fourth gospel. It is certainly surprising that when Pilate asks 
whether he be really the King of the Jews, Jesus should reply by the 
counter-question, whether he say this of himself or at the suggestion of 
another. In an accused person, however conscious of innocence, such a question 
cannot be held warrantable, and hence it has been sought in every possible way 
to give the words of Jesus a sense more consonant with propriety: but the 
question of Jesus is too definite to be a mere repulse of the accusation as 
absurd,* and too indefinite to be regarded as an inquiry, whether the Procurator 
intended the title <font FACE="Symbol">basileuV twn Ioudaiwn </font>in<i> </i>
the Roman sense (<font FACE="Symbol">af</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">eautou)
</font>or in the Jewish (<font FACE="Symbol">alloi soi eipon</font>).<sup>†</sup> 
And Pilate does not so understand it, but as an unwarrantable question to which 
it is a mark of his indulgence that he replies ;—in the first instance, it is 
true, with some impatience, by the second counter-question, whether he be a Jew, 
and thus able of himself to have information concerning a crime so specifically 
Jewish; but hereupon he good-naturedly adds that it is the Jews and their rulers 
by whom Jesus has been delivered to him, and that he is therefore at liberty to 
speak more particularly of the crime which these lay to his charge. Now<i> </i>
on this Jesus gives Pilate an answer which, added to the impression of his whole 
appearance, might certainly induce in the Procurator a conviction of his 
innocence. He replies, namely, that his <i>kingdom </i><font FACE="Symbol">
basileia<i> </i></font>is not <i>of this world </i><font FACE="Symbol">ek tou 
kosmou toutou</font><i>, </i>and adduces as a proof of this, the peaceful, 
passive conduct of his adherents on his </p>

<p>* </sup>Calvin, in loc.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Lücke and Tholuck, in loc.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">763</p>
<p>arrest (v. 36). On the further question of Pilate, whether, since Jesus has 
thus ascribed to himself a kingdom, although no earthly one, he then claims to 
be a king? he replies that certainly he is so, but only in so far as he is born 
to be a witness to the truth: whereupon follows the famous question of Pilate:
<i>What is truth?</i><font FACE="Symbol">ti estin alhqeia</font>;<i> </i>
Although in this latter reply of Jesus we cannot but be struck by its presenting 
the peculiar hue of thought whlch characterizes the author of the fourth gospel, 
in the use of the idea of <i>truth </i><font FACE="Symbol">alhqeia</font><i>,
</i>as we were before surprised at the unwarrantable nature of the 
counter-question of Jesus; still this account in John renders it conceivable how 
Pilate could immediately step forth and declare to the Jews that he found no 
fault in Jesus. But another point might easily create suspicion against this 
narrative of John. According to him the trial of Jesus went forward in the 
interior of the Prætorium, which no Jew would venture to enter; who then are we 
to suppose heard the conversation of the Procurator with Jesus, and was the 
informant who communicated it to the author of the fourth gospel? The opinion of 
the older commentators that Jesus himself narrated these conversations to his 
disciples after the resurrection is renounced as extravagant; the more modern 
idea that perhaps Pilate himself was the source of the information concerning 
the trial, is scarcely less improbable, and rather than take refuge, with Lücke, 
in the supposition that Jesus remained at the entrance of the Prætorium, so that 
those standing immediately without might with some attention and stillness (?) 
have heard the conversation, I should prefer appealing to the attendants of the 
Procurator, who would scarcely be alone with Jesus. Meanwhile it is easily 
conceivable that we have here a conversation, which owes its origin solely to 
the Evangelist’s own combination, and in this case we need not bestow so much 
labour in ascertaining the precise sense of Pilate’s question <i>: what is 
truth? </i>since this would only be an example of the fourth Evangelist’s 
favourite form of dialogue, the contrast of profound communications on the part 
of Jesus, with questions either of misapprehension or of total unintelligence on 
the part of the hearers, as xii.<i> </i>34, the Jews ask <i>who is this Son of 
man?</i><font FACE="Symbol">tiV estin outoV o uioV t. a.;</font><i> </i>so here 
Pilate: <font FACE="Symbol">ti estin</font> <font FACE="Symbol">alhqeia</font><i> 
what is truth?</i><font FACE="Symbol"> ti estin alhqeia</font> ;<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>Before the introduction of Barabbas, which in all the other Evangelists comes 
next in order, Luke has an episode peculiar to himself. On the declaration of 
Pilate that he finds no guilt in the accused, the chief priests and their 
adherents among the multitude persist in asserting that Jesus stirred up the 
people by his agency as a teacher from Galilee to Jerusalem: Pilate notices the 
word Galilee, asks whether the accused be a Galilean, and when this is 
confirmed, he seizes it as a welcome pretext for ridding himself of the 
ungrateful business, and sends Jesus to the Tetrarch of Galilee, Herod Antipas, 
at that time in Jerusalem in observance of the feast; </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Comp. Kaiser, bibl. Theol.1, s. 252<i>.</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">765</p>
<p>perhaps also designing as a secondary object, what at least was the result, 
to conciliate the petty prince by this show of respect for his jurisdiction. 
This measure, it is said, gave great satisfaction to Herod, because having heard 
much of Jesus, he had long been desirous to see him, in the hope that he would 
perhaps perform a miracle. The Tetrarch addressed various questions to him, the 
Sanhedrists urged vehement accusations against him, but Jesus gave no answer; 
whereupon Herod with his soldiers betook themselves to mockery, and at length, 
after arraying him in a gorgeous robe, sent him back to Pilate (xxiii. 4 ff<i>.).
</i>This narrative of Luke’s, whether we consider it in itself or in its 
relation to the other gospels, has much to astonish us. If Jesus as a Galilean 
really belonged to the jurisdiction of Herod, as Pilate, by delivering the 
accused to him, appears to acknowledge: how came Jesus (and the question is 
equally difficult whether we regard him as the sinless Jesus of the orthodox 
system, or as the one who in the history of the tribute-penny manifested his 
subjection to the existing authorities) to withhold from him the answer which 
was his due? and how was it that Herod, without any further procedures, sent him 
away again from his tribunal? To say, with Olshausen, that the interrogation 
before Herod had elicited the fact that Jesus was not born in Nazareth and 
Galilee, but in Bethlehem, and consequently in Judæa, is on the one hand an 
inadmissible appeal to the history of the birth of Jesus, of the statements in 
which there is no further trace in the whole subsequent course of Luke’s gospel; 
and on the other hand, a totally accidental birth in Judæa, such as that 
represented by Luke, the parents of Jesus, and even Jesus himself, being both 
before and after resident in Galilee, would not have constituted Jesus a Judæan; 
but above all we must ask, through whom was the Judæan origin of Jesus brought 
to light, since it is said of Jesus that he gave no answer, while according to 
all the information we possess, that origin was totally unknown to the Jews? It 
would be preferable to explain the silence of Jesus by the unbecoming manner of 
Herod’s interrogation, which manifested, not the seriousness of the judge, but 
mere curiosity; and to account for his being sent back to Pilate by the fact, 
that not only the arrest, but also a part of the ministry of Jesus had occurred 
within the jurisdiction of Pilate. But why do the rest of the Evangelists say 
nothing of the entire episode? Especially when the author of the fourth gospel 
is regarded as the Apostle John, it is not easy to see how this omission can be 
explained. The common plea, that he supposed the fact sufficiently known from 
the synoptists, will not serve here, since Luke is the sole Evangelist who 
narrates the incident, and thus it does not appear to have been very widely 
spread; the conjecture, that it may probably have appeared to him too 
unimportant,* loses all foundation when it is considered that John does not 
scorn to mention the leading away to Annas, which nevertheless was equally 
indecisive; and in general, the narrative of these events in John is, as 
Schleiermacher himself confesses, so consecutive that it nowhere presents a 
break in which such an episode could be inserted. Hence even Schleiermacher at 
last takes refuge in the conjecture that possibly the sending to Herod may have 
escaped the notice of John, because it happened on an opposite side to that on 
which the disciple stood, through a back door; and that it came to the knowledge 
of Luke because his informant had an acquaintance in the household of Herod, as 
John had in that of Annas: the former conjecture, however, is figuratively as 
well as literally nothing more than a back door; the latter, a fiction which is 
but the effort of despair. Certainly if we renounce the presupposition that the 
author of the fourth gospel was an apostle, we lose the ground of attack against 
the narrative of Luke, which in any case, since Justin knows of the consignment 
to Herod,<sup>†</sup> is of very early origin. Nevertheless, first, the silence 
of the other Evangelists in a portion of their common history, in which, with 
this exception, there prevails an agreement as to the principal stages in the 
development of the fate of Jesus; and secondly, the internal difficulties of the 
narrative, remain so suspicious, that it must still be open to us to conjecture, 
that the anecdote arose out of the effort to place Jesus before all the 
tribunals that could possibly be gathered together in Jerusalem; to make every 
authority not hierarchical, though treating him with ignominy, still either 
explicitly or tacitly acknowledge his innocence; and to represent him as 
maintaining his equable demeanour and dignity before all. If this be probable 
with respect to the present narrative, in which the third Evangelist stands 
alone, a similar conjecture concerning the leading away to Annas, in which we 
have seen that the fourth Evangelist stands alone, would only be warded off by 
the circumstance that this scene is not described in detail, and hence presents 
no internal difficulties.</p>
<p>After Jesus, being sent back by Herod, was returned upon his hands, Pilate, 
according to Luke, once more called together the Sanhedrists and the people, and 
declared, alleging in his support the judgment of Herod as accordant with his 
own, his wish to dismiss Jesus with chastisement; for which purpose he might 
avail himself of the custom of releasing a prisoner at the feast of the 
passover.<sup>‡</sup> This circumstance, which is somewhat abridged in Luke, is 
more fully exhibited in the other Evangelists, especially in Matthew. As the 
privilege to entreat the release of a prisoner belonged to the people, Pilate, 
well knowing that Jesus was persecuted by the rulers out of jealousy, sought to 
turn to his advantage the better disposition of the people towards him; and in 
order virtually to oblige them to free Jesus, whom, partly out of mockery of the 
Jews, partly </p>

nothing but for the N. T., was of Roman or Jewish origin; comp. Fritzsche and

<p ALIGN="CENTER">766</p>
<p>to deter them from his execution as degrading to themselves, he named the 
Messiah or King of the Jews, he reminded them that their choice lay between him 
and a <i>notable prisoner, </i><font FACE="Symbol">desmioV epishmoV</font>, 
Barabbas* whom John designates as a <i>robber, </i><font FACE="Symbol">lhsthV</font>, 
but Mark and Luke as one who was imprisoned for insurrection and murder. This 
plan however failed, for the people, suborned, as the two first Evangelists 
observe, by their rulers, with one voice desired the release of Barabbas and the 
crucifixion of Jesus.</p>
<p>As a circumstance which had especial weight with Pilate in favour of Jesus, 
and moved him to make the proposal relative to Barabbas as urgently as possible, 
it is stated by Matthew that while the procurator sat on his tribunal, his wife,<sup>†</sup> 
in consequence of a disturbing dream, sent to him a warning to incur no 
responsibility in relation to that just man (xxvii. 19). Not only Paulus, but 
even Olshausen, explains this dream as a natural result of what Pilate’s wife 
might have heard of Jesus and of his capture on the preceding evening; to which 
may be added as an explanatory conjecture, the notice of the <i>Evangelium 
Nicodemi, </i>that she was <i>pious, </i><font FACE="Symbol">qeosebhV</font>, 
and <i>judaizing,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">ioudaizousa</font><i>.</i><sup>‡ </sup>
Nevertheless, as constantly in the New Testament, and particularly in the Gospel 
of Matthew, dreams are regarded as a special dispensation from heaven, so this 
assuredly in the opinion of the narrator happened <i>non sine numine; </i>and 
hence it should be possible to conceive a motive and an object for the 
dispensation. If the dream were really intended to prevent the death of Jesus, 
taking the orthodox point of view, in which this death was necessary for the 
salvation of man, we must be led to the opinion of some of the ancients, that it 
may have been the devil who suggested that dream to the wife of the procurator, 
in order to hinder the propitiatory death;<sup>§</sup> if on the contrary, the 
dream were not intended to prevent the death of Jesus, its object must have been 
limited to Pilate or his wife. But as far as Pilate was concerned, so late a 
warning could only aggravate his guilt, without sufficing to deter him from the 
step already half taken; while that his wife was converted by means of this 
dream, as many have supposed,|| is totally unattested by history or tradition, 
and such an object is not intimated in the narrative. But, as the part which 
Pilate himself plays in the evangelical narrative is such as to exhibit the 
blind </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>According to one reading, the full name of this man was <i>Jesus 
Barabbas, </i>which we mention here merely because Olshausen finds it 
&quot;remarkable.&quot; <i>Bar Abba </i>meaning <i>Son of the father, </i>Olshausen 
exclaims: All that was essential in the Saviour appears in the murderer as 
caricature! and he quotes as applicable to this case the verse : <i>ludit in 
humanis divina potentia rebus. </i>For our own part, we can only see in this 
idea of Olshausen’s a <i>lusus humanæ impotentiæ.</p>

<p>hatred of the fellow-countrymen of Jesus in contrast with the impartial 
judgment of a Gentile; so his wife is made to render a testimony to Jesus, in 
order that, not only out of the mouth of <i>babes and sucklings </i>(Matt. xxi. 
16), but also out of the mouth of a weak woman, praise might be prepared for 
him; and to increase its importance it is traced to a significant dream. To give 
this an appearance of probability, similar instances are adduced from profane 
history of dreams which have acted as presentiments and warnings before a 
sanguinary catastrophe * but the more numerous are these analogous cases, the 
more is the suspicion excited that as the majority of these; so also the dream 
in our evangelical passage, may have been fabricated after the event, for the 
sake of heightening its tragical effect.</p>
<p>When the Jews, in reply to the repeated questions of Pilate, vehemently and 
obstinately demand the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion of Jesus, the two 
intermediate Evangelists represent him as at once yielding to their desire; but 
Matthew first interposes a ceremony and a colloquy (xxvii. 24 ff.). According to 
him Pilate calls for water, washes his hands before the people, and declares 
himself innocent of the blood of this just man. The washing of the hands, as a 
protestation of purity from the guilt of shedding blood, was a custom 
specifically Jewish, according to Deut. xxi. 6 f.<sup>†</sup> It has been 
thought improbable that the Roman should have here intentionally imitated this 
Jewish custom, and hence it has been contended, that to any one who wished so 
solemnly to declare his innocence nothing would more readily suggest itself than 
the act of washing the hands.<sup>‡</sup> But that an individual, apart from any 
allusion to a known usage, should invent extemporaneously a symbolical act, or 
even that he should merely fall in with the custom of a foreign nation, would 
require him to be deeply interested in the fact which he intends to symbolize. 
That Pilate, however, should be deeply interested in attesting his innocence of 
the execution of Jesus, is not so probable as that the Chnstians should have 
been deeply interested in thus gaining a testimony to the innocence of their 
Messiah whence there arises a suspicion that perhaps Pilate’s act of washing his 
hands owes its origin to them alone. This conjecture is confirmed, when we 
consider the declaration with which Pilate accompanies his symbolical act: <i>I 
am innocent of the blood of this just man, </i><font FACE="Symbol">aqwoV eimi 
apo tou aimatoV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">tou dikaiou toutou</font><i>. </i>For 
that the judge should publicly and emphatically designate as a <i>just man, </i>
&amp;acatoc, one whom he was nevertheless delivering over to the severest mnflic 
tionof the law,—this even Paulus finds so contradictory that he here, contrary 
to his usual mode of exposition, supposes that the narrator himself expresses in 
these words his own interpretation of Pilate’s symbolical act. It is surprising 
that he is not </p>

<p>‡ </sup>Fritzsche, in Matth., p. 808.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">768</p>
<p>also struck by the equal improbability of the answer which is attributed to 
the Jews on this occasion. After Pilate has declared himself guiltless of the 
blood of Jesus, and by the addition: <i>see ye to it, </i>has laid the 
responsibility on the Jews, it is said in Matthew that <i>all the people </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">paV o laoV</font>, cried: <i>His blood be on us and on our 
children, </i><font FACE="Symbol">to aima autouef</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">hmaV 
kai ta tekna hmwn. </font>But this is obviously spoken from the point of view of 
the Christians, who in the miseries which shortly after the death of Jesus fell 
with continually increasing weight on the Jewish nation, saw nothing else than 
the payment of the debt of blood which they had incurred by the crucifixion of 
Jesus: so that this whole episode, which is peculiar to the first gospel, is in 
the highest degree suspicious.</p>
<p>According to Matthew and Mark, Pilate now caused Jesus to be scourged, 
preparatory to his being led away to crucifixion. Here the scourging appears to 
correspond to the <i>virgis cædere, </i>which according to Roman usage preceded 
the <i>securi percutere, </i>and to the scourging of slaves prior to 
crucifixion.* In Luke it has a totally different character. While in the two 
former Evangelists it is said: <i>When he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him 
to be crucified,</i>;<i> </i>in Luke, Pilate repeatedly (v. 16 and 22) makes the 
proposal : <i>having chastised him I will let him go,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">
paideusaV auton apolusw</font><i>: </i>i. e. while there the scourging has the 
appearance of a mere accessory of the crucifixion, here it appears to be 
intended as a substitute for the crucifixion: Pilate wishes by this chastisement 
to appease the hatred of the enemies of Jesus, and induce them to desist from 
demanding his execution. Again, while in Luke the scourging does not actually 
take place,—because the Jews will in nowise accede to the repeated proposal of 
Pilate: in John the latter causes Jesus to be scourged, exhibits him to the 
people with the purple robe and the crown of thorns and tries whether his 
pitiable aspect, together with the repeated declaration of his innocence, will 
not mollify their embittered minds : this, however, proving also in vain (xix. 1 
ff.). Thus there exists a contradiction between the Evangelists in relation to 
the scourging of Jesus, which is not to be conciliated after the method of 
Paulus, namely by paraphrasing the words <font FACE="Symbol">ton de I. 
fragellwsaV paredwken ina staurwqh</font> in Matthew and Mark thus : Jesus, whom 
he had already before scourged in order to save him, suffered this in vain, 
since he was still delivered over to crucifixion. But, acknowledging the 
difference in the accounts, we must only ask, which of the two has the advantage 
as regards historical probability? Although it is certainly not to be proved 
that scourging before crucifixion was a Roman custom admitting no exception: 
still, on the other hand, it is a purely harmonistic effort to allege, that 
scourging was only made to precede crucifixion in cases where the punishment was 
intended to be particularly severe,<sup>†</sup> and that consequently Pilate,

<p>† </sup>Paulus, ut sup. s, 647.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">769</p>
<p>who had no wish to be cruel to Jesus, can only have caused him to be scourged 
with the special design which Luke and John mention, and which is also to be 
understood in the narratives of their predecessors. It is far more probable that 
in reality the scourging only took place as it is described by the two first 
Evangelists, namely, as an introduction to the crucifixion, and that the 
Christian legend (to which that side of Pilate’s character, in virtue of which 
he endeavoured in various ways to save Jesus, was particularly welcome as a 
testimony against the Jews) gave such a turn even to the fact of the scourging 
as to obtain from it a new attempt at release on the part of Pilate. This use of 
the fact is only incipient in the third gospel, for here the scourging is a mere 
proposal of Pilate : whereas in the fourth, the scourging actually takes place, 
and becomes an additional act in the drama.</p>
<p>With the scourging is connected in the two first gospels and the fourth, the 
maltreatment and mockery of Jesus by the soldiers, who attired him in a purple 
robe, placed a crown of thorns on his head,* put, according to Matthew, a reed 
in his hand, and in this disguise first greeted him as King of the Jews, and 
then smote and maltreated him.<sup>†</sup> Luke does not mention any derision on 
the part of the soldiers here, but he has something similar in his narrative of 
the interrogation of Jesus before Herod, for he represents this prince <i>with 
his men of war </i><font FACE="Symbol">sun toiV strateumasin autou</font>, as 
mocking Jesus, and sending him back to Pilate in a <i>gorgeous robe, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">esqhV lampra</font><i>. </i>Many suppose that this was the 
same purple robe which was afterwards put on Jesus by the soldiers of Pilate; 
but it must rather have been thrice that Jesus had to wear this disguise, if we 
take the narrative of John into the account and at the same time refuse to 
attribute error to any of the synoptists: first in the presence of Herod (Luke); 
secondly, before Pilate brought Jesus forth to the Jews, that he might excite 
their compassion with the words: <i>Behold the man, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ide 
o anqrwpoV </font>(John); thirdly, after he was delivered to the soldiers for 
crucifixion (Matthew and Mark). This repetition is as improbable as it is 
probable that the one disguising of Jesus, which had come to the knowledge of 
the Evangelists, was assigned by them to different places and times, and 
ascribed to different persons.</p>
<p>While in the two first gospels the process of trial is already concluded 
before the scourging, and in the third, on the rejection of his proposal to 
scourge and release Jesus by the Jews, Pilate forthwith delivers him to be 
crucified: in the fourth Evangelist the scene of the trial is further developed 
in the following manner. When even the exhibition of Jesus scourged and 
disguised avails nothing, but his crucifixion is obstinately demanded, the 
Procurator is incensed, </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>From the explanation of Paulus, s. 649 f., it appears highly probable 
that the <font FACE="Symbol">stefanoV ex akanqwn </font>was not a crown of sharp 
thorns, but one taken from the nearest hedge, in order to deride Jesus by the <i>
vilissima corona, spineola</i>. (Plin<i>. </i>H. N. xxi. 10).</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>A similar disguising of a man, in derision of a third party, is 
adduced by Wetstein, (p. 533 f.) from Philo, in Flaccum.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">770</p>
<p>and cries to the Jews, that they may take him and crucify him themselves, for 
he finds no fault in him. The Jews reply that according to their law, he must 
die, since he had made himself the <i>Son of God </i><font FACE="Symbol">uioV 
qeou</font>; a remark which affects Pilate with a superstitious fear, whence he 
once more leads Jesus into the Prætorium, and inquires concerning his origin 
(whether it be really heavenly), on which Jesus gives him no answer, and when 
the procurator seeks to alarm him by reminding him of the power which he 
possesses over his life, refers to the higher source from whence he had this 
power. Pilate, after this reply, seeks (yet more earnestly than before) to 
release Jesus; but at last the Jews hit upon the right means of making him 
accede to their will, by throwing out the intimation that, if he release Jesus 
who has opposed himself to Cæsar as an usurper, he cannot be <i>Cæsar’s friend.
</i>Thus, intimidated by the possibility of his being calumniated to Tiberius, 
he mounts the tribunal, and, since he cannot prosecute his will, betakes himself 
to derision of the Jews in the question, whether they then wish that he should 
crucify their king? Whereupon they, keeping to the position which they had last 
taken with such evident effect, protest that they will have no king but Cæsar. 
The procurator now consents to deliver Jesus to be crucified, for which purpose, 
as the two first Evangelists remark, the purple mantle was removed, and he was 
again attired in his own clothes.</p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p>§ </font>132. THE CRUCIFIXION.</p>
<p>Even concerning the progress of Jesus to the place of crucifixion there is a 
divergency between the synoptists and John, for according to the latter Jesus 
himself carried his cross thither (xix. 17), while the former state that one 
Simon a Cyrenian bore it in his stead (Matt. xxvii. 32 parall.). The 
commentators indeed, as if a real agreement were assumed as a matter of course, 
reconcile these statements thus : at first Jesus himself endeavoured to bear the 
cross, but as the attempt made it obvious that he was too much exhausted, it was 
laid on Simon.* But when John says: <i>And he bearing his cross went forth into
</i><font FACE="Arial">— </font><i>Golgotha, where they crucified him, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">kai bastazwn ton stauron autou exhlqen</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">eiV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">Golgoqa</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">opou auton estaurwsan</font><i>: </i>he plainly presupposes 
that the cross was borne by Jesus on the way thither.<sup>†</sup> But the 
statement so unanimously given by the synoptists respecting the substitution of 
Simon appears the less capable of being rejected, the more difficult it is to 
discover a motive which might lead to its fabrication. On the contrary, this 
individual trait might very probably have remained unknown in the circle in 
which the fourth gospel had its origin, and the author might </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Thus Paulus, Kuinöl, Tholuck and Olshausen in their Commentaries; 
Neander, L. J. Chr., s. 634.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Fritzsche, in Marc. 684 <i>Significat Joannes, Jesum suam crucein 
portavisse, donec ad Calvariæ locurn pervenisset</i>.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">771</p>
<p>have thought that, according to the general custom, Jesus must have carried 
his cross. All the synoptists designate this Simon as a <i>Cyrenian, </i>i.e. 
probably one who had come to Jerusalem to the feast, from the Libyan city of 
Cyrene, where many Jews resided.* According to all, the carrying of the cross 
was forced upon him, a circumstance which can as little be urged for as against 
the opinion that he was favourable to Jesus.<sup>†</sup> According to Luke and 
Mark, the man came directly <i>out of the country, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ap</font>’
<font FACE="Symbol">agrou</font>, and as he attempted to pass by the crowd 
advancing to the place of crucifixion, he was made use of to relieve Jesus. Mark 
designates him yet more particularly as <i>the father of Alexander and Rufus,
</i>who appear to have been noted persons in the primitive church (comp. Rom. 
xvi. 1; Acts xix. 33 (?)<i>; </i>1<i> </i>Tim. i. <i>20 </i>(?); 2<i> </i>Tim. 
iv. 14 (?) ).<sup>‡</sup> </p>
<p>On the way to the place of execution, according to Luke, there followed 
Jesus, lamenting him, a great company, consisting especially of women, whom he 
however admonished to weep rather for themselves and their children, in prospect 
of the terrible time, which would soon come upon them (xxiii. 27 ff.). The 
details are taken partly from the discourse on the second advent, Luke xxi. 23; 
for as there it is said, <font FACE="Symbol">Ouai de taiV en gastri ecousaiV, 
kai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">taiV qhlazousaiV, en ekeinaiV taiV hmeraiV</font><i>,
</i>so here Jesus says, that the days are coming in which <font FACE="Symbol">ai 
steirai kai koiliai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ai ouk egennhsan, kai mastoi oi 
ouk eqhlasan</font><i>, </i>will be pronounced blessed; partly from Hosea x. 8, 
for the words <font FACE="Symbol">tote</font> <font FACE="Symbol">arxontai 
legein toiV oresi k. t. l. </font><i>(then shall they begin to say to the 
mountains, </i>etc.) are almost exactly the Alexandrian translation of that 
passage.</p>
<p>The place of execution is named by all the Evangelists <i>Golgotha, </i>the 
Chaldaic [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>gulgalta’</b> and they all interpret this 
designation by <font FACE="Symbol">kraniou topoV </font><i>the place of a skull,
</i>or <font FACE="Symbol">kranion</font><i> a skull </i>(Matt. v<i>. </i>33 
parall.). From the latter name it might appear that the place was so called 
because it resembled a skull in form; whereas the former interpretation, and 
indeed the nature of the case, renders it probable that it owed its name to its 
destination as a place of execution, and to the bones and skulls of the executed 
which were heaped up there. Where this place was situated is not known, but 
doubtless it was out of the city; even that it was a hill, is a mere conjecture.<sup>§
</p>
</sup>
<p>The course of events after the arrival at the place of execution is narrated 
by Matthew (v. 34 ff.) in a somewhat singular order. First, he mentions the 
beverage offered to Jesus; next, he says that after they had nailed him to the 
tross, the soldiers shared his clothes among them; then, that they sat down and 
watched him; after this he notices the superscription on the cross, and at 
length, and not as if supplying a previous omission, but with a particle 
expressive of succession in time (<font FACE="Symbol">tote</font>)<i>, </i>the 
fact that two thieves were crucified with him. Mark follows Matthew, except that 
instead of the statement </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">772</p>
<p>about the watching of the cross, he has a determination of the time at which 
Jesus was crucified: while Luke more correctly relates first the crucifixion of 
the two malefactors with Jesus, and then the casting of lots for the clothes; 
and the same order is observed by John. But it is inadmissible on this account 
to transpose the verses in Matthew (34,<font FACE="Arial"> </font>37, 38, <i>35,
</i>36), as has been proposed ;<sup>* </sup>and we must rather abandon the 
author of the first gospel to the charge, that in his anxiety not to omit any of 
the chief events at the crucifixion of Jesus, he has neglected the natural order 
of time.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>As regards the mode of the crucifixion there is now scarcely any debated 
point, if we except the question, whether the feet as well as the hands were 
nailed to the cross. As it lay in the interest of the orthodox view to prove the 
affirmative: so it was equally important to the rationalistic system to maintain 
the negative. From Justin Martyr <sup>‡ </sup>down to Hengstenberg <sup>§ </sup>
and Olshausen, the orthodox find in the nailing of the feet of Jesus to the 
cross a fulfilment of the prophecy Ps. xxii. 17<i>, </i>which the LXX. 
translates: <font FACE="Symbol">wruxan</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ceiraV mou kai 
podaV</font>, but it is doubtful whether the original text really speaks of 
piercing, and in no case does it allude to crucifixion: moreover the passage is 
nowhere applied to Christ in the New Testament. To the rationalists, on the 
contrary, it is at once more easy to explain the death of Jesus as a merely 
apparent death, and only possible to conceive how he could walk immediately 
after the resurrection, when it is supposed that his feet were left unwounded; 
but the case should rather be stated thus: if the historical evidence go to 
prove that the feet also of Jesus were nailed, it must be concluded that the 
resuscitation and the power of walking shortly after, either happened 
supernaturally or not at all. Of late there have stood opposed to each other two 
learned and profound investigations of this point, the one by Paulus against, 
the other by Bähr, in favour of the nailing of the feet. <sup>|| </sup>From the 
evangelical narrative, the former opinion can principally allege in its support, 
that neither is the above passage in the Psalms anywhere used by the 
Evangelists, though on the presupposition of a nailing of the feet it was so 
entirely suited to their mode of accounting for facts, nor in the history of the 
resurrection is there any mention of wounds in the feet, together with the 
wounds in the hands and side (John xx. 20, 25, 27).<font FACE="Arial"><i> </i>
</font>The other opinion appeals not without reason to Luke xxiv. 39, where 
Jesus invites the disciples to behold his hands and his feet (<font FACE="Symbol">idete</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">taV ceiraV mou kai touV podaV mou)</font><i>: </i>it is 
certainly not here said that the feet were pierced, but it is difficult to 
understand </p>

<p>how Jesus should have pointed out his feet merely to produce a conviction of 
the reality of his body. The fact that among the fathers of the church, those 
who, living before Constantine, might be acquainted with the mode of crucifixion 
from personal observation, as Justin and Tertullian, suppose the feet of Jesus 
to have been nailed, is of weight. it might indeed be concluded from the remark 
of the latter: <i>Qui (Christus) solus a populo tam insigniter crucifixus est,<sup>*
</sup></i>that for the sake of the passage in the Psalms these fathers supposed 
that in the crucifixion of Christ his feet also were pierced by way of 
exception; but, as Tertuilian had before called the piercing of the hands and 
feet the <i>propria atrocia crucis, </i>it is plain that the above words imply, 
not a special manner of crucifixion, but the special manner of death by 
crucifixion, which does not occur in the Old Testament, and by which therefore 
Jesus was distinguished from all the characters therein celebrated. Among the 
passages in profane writers, the most important is that of Plautus, in which, to 
mark a crucifixion as extraordinarily severe, it is said: <i>offigantur bis 
pedes, bis brachia.</i><sup>†<i> </i></sup>Here the question is: does the 
extraordinary feature lie in the <i>bis, </i>so that the nailing of the feet as 
well as of the hands only once is presupposed as the ordinary usage; or was the
<i>bis offigere </i>of the hands, i.e. the nailing of both the hands, the usual 
practice, and the nailing of the feet an extraordinary aggravation of the 
punishment? Every one will pronounce the former alternative to be the most 
accordant with the words. Hence it appears to me at present, that the balance of 
historical evidence is on the side of those who maintain that the feet as well 
as the hands of Jesus were nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>It was before the crucifixion, according to the two first Evangelists, that 
there was offered to Jesus a beverage, which Matthew (v. 34) describes as <i>
vinegar mingled with gall, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oxoV meta colhV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">memigmenon</font><i>, </i>Mark (v. 23) as <i>wine mingled 
with myrrh, </i><font FACE="Symbol">esmurnismenon oinon</font>, but which, 
according to both, Jesus (Matthew says, after having tasted it) refused to 
accept. As it is not understood with what object gall could be mixed with the 
vinegar, the <font FACE="Symbol">colh </font>of Matthew is usually explained, by 
the aid of the <font FACE="Symbol">esmurnismenon</font> of Mark, as implying 
bitter vegetable ingredients, especially myrrh; and then either
<font FACE="Symbol">oinon </font><i>wine </i>is actually substituted for
<font FACE="Symbol">oxoV</font> <i>vinegar, </i>or the latter is understood as 
sour wine ;<sup>‡ </sup>in order that the beverage offered to Jesus may thus 
appear to have been the stupefying draught consisting of wine and strong spices, 
which, according to Jewish usage, was presented to those about to be executed, 
for the purpose of blunting their susceptibility to pain.<sup>§ </sup>But even 
if the text admitted of this reading, and the words of this interpretation, 
Matthew would assuredly protest strongly against the real gall and the vinegar 
being thus </p>

<p>explained away from his narrative, because by this means he would lose the 
fulfilment of the passage in the psalm of lamentation elsewhere used 
messianically: (LXX.) <font FACE="Symbol">kai edwkan</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
eiV to brwma mou colhn, kai eiV thn diyan mou epotisan</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">me oxoV</font>, <i>they gave me also gall for my meat, and 
in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink </i>(Ps. lxix. 21). Matthew 
incontestably means, in accordance with this prophecy, real gall with vinegar, 
and the comparison with Mark is only calculated to suggest the question, whether 
it be more probable that Mark presents the incident in its original form, which 
Matthew has remodelled into a closer accordance with the prophecy; or that 
Matthew originally drew the particular from the passage in the Psalm, and that 
Mark so modified it as to give it an appearance of greater historical 
probability?</p>
<p>In order to come to a decision on this question we must take the two other 
Evangelists into consideration. The presentation to Jesus of a drink mingled 
with vinegar is mentioned by all four, and even the two who have the vinegar 
mingled with gall, or the myrrhed wine, as the first drink offered to Jesus, 
mention afterwards the offering of simple vinegar. According to Luke, this <i>
offering of vinegar, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oxoV prosferein, </font>was an act 
of derision committed by the soldiers not very long after the crucifixion, and 
before the commencement of the darkness (v. 36 f.); according to Mark, shortly 
before the end, three hours after the darkness came on, one of the bystanders, 
on hearing the cry of Jesus: <i>my God, my God</i>, etc., presented vinegar to 
him, likewise in derision, by means of a sponge fixed on a reed (v. 36); 
according to Matthew, one of the bystanders, on the same cry, and in the same 
manner, presented vinegar to him, but with a benevolent intention, as we gather 
from the circumstance that the scoffers wished to deter him from the act (v. 48 
f.);<sup>* </sup>whereas in John it is on the exclamation: <i>.I thirst, </i>
that some fill a sponge with vinegar from a vessel standing near, and raise it 
on a stem of hyssop to the mouth of Jesus (v. 29).<i> </i>Hence it has been 
supposed that there were three separate attempts to give a beverage to Jesus: 
the first before the crucifixion, with the stupefying drink (Matthew and Mark); 
the second after the crucifixion, when the soldiers in mockery offered him some 
of their ordinary beverage, a mixture of vinegar and water called <i>posca<sup>†
</sup></i>(Luke); and the third, on the complaining cry of Jesus (Matt., Mark 
and John).<sup>‡ </sup>But if the principle of considering every divergent 
narrative as a separate event be once admitted, it must be consistently carried 
out: if the beverage mentioned by Luke must be distinguished from that of 
Matthew and Mark on account of a difference in the time, then must that of 
Matthew be distinguished from that of Mark on account of the difference in the 
design; and, again, the beverage mentioned by John must not be regarded as the 
same with that of the two first synoptists, since it follows a totally different 
exclamation. Thus </p>
<sup>

<sup>
<p>† </sup>Camp. Paulus, in loc.</p>
<sup>
<p>‡ </sup>Thus Kuinöl, in Luc., p. 710 f.; Tholuck, s. 316.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">775</p>
<p>we should obtain in all five instances in which a drink was offered to Jesus, 
and we should at least be at a loss to understand why Jesus after vinegar had 
already been thrice presented to his lips, should yet a fourth time have desired 
to drink. If then we must resort to simplification, it is by no means only the 
beverage in the two first gospels, and that in the fourth, which, on account of 
the agreement in the time and manner of presentation, are to be understood as 
one; but also that of Mark (and through this the others) must be pronounced 
identical with that of Luke, on account of their being alike offered in 
derision. Thus there remain two instances of a drink being offered to Jesus, the 
one before the crucifixion, the other after; and both have a presumptive support 
from history, the former in the Jewish custom of giving a stupefying draught to 
persons about to be executed, the other in the Roman custom, according to which 
the soldiers on their expeditions,—and the completing an execution was 
considered as such,—-were in the habit of taking with them their <i>posca. </i>
But together with this possible historical root, there is a possible prophetic 
one in Ps. lxix., and the two have an opposite influence: the latter excites a 
suspicion that the narrative may not have anything historical at its foundation; 
the former throws doubt on the explanation that the whole story has been spun 
out of the prophecies.</p>
<p>On once more glancing over the various narratives, we shall at least find 
that their divergencies are precisely of a nature to have arisen from a various 
application of the passage in the Psalms. The eating of gall and the drinking of 
vinegar being there spoken of, it appears as if in the first instance the former 
particular had been set aside as inconceivable, and the fulfilment of the 
prophecy found in the circumstance (very possibly historical, since it is 
mentioned by all the four Evangelists), that Jesus had vinegar presented to him 
when on the cross. This might either be regarded as an act of compassion, as by 
Matthew and John, or of mockery, with Mark and Luke. In this manner the words:
<i>they gave me vinegar to drink, </i><font FACE="Symbol">epotisan me oxoV</font>, 
were indeed literally fulfilled, but not the preceding phrase: <i>in my thirst,</i><font FACE="Symbol">eiV 
thn diyan mou</font>; hence the author of the fourth gospel might think it 
probable that Jesus actually complained of thirst, i.e.cried, <i>I thirst, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">diyw</font><i>, </i>an exclamation, which he expressly 
designates as a fulfilment of the <i>scripture, </i><font FACE="Symbol">grafh</font><i>,
</i>by which we are doubtless to understand the above passage in the Psalms 
(comp. Ps. xxii. 16); nay, since he introduces the <font FACE="Symbol">ina 
teleiwqh h grafh</font><i>, that the scripture might be fulfilled, </i>by
<font FACE="Symbol">eidwV o IhsouV oti panta hdh tetlestai</font><i>, Jesus. 
knowing that all things were now accomplished, </i>he almost appears to mean 
that the fulfilment of the prophecy was the sole object of Jesus in uttering 
that exclamation: but a man suspended on the cross in the agonies of death is 
not the one to occupy himself with such typological trifling—this is only the 
part of his biographer who finds himself in perfect ease. Even this addition, 
however, only showed the fulfilment of </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">776</p>
<p>one half of the messianic verse, that relating to the vinegar: there still 
remained what was said of the gall, which, as the concentration of all 
bitterness, was peculiarly adapted to be placed in relation to the suffering 
Messiah. It is true that the presentation of the <i>gall,</i>
<font FACE="Symbol">colh </font>as <i>meat </i><font FACE="Symbol">brwma</font>, 
which the prophecy strictly taken required, was still suppressed as 
inconceivable: but it appeared to the first Evangelist, or to the authority 
which he here follows, quite practicable to introduce the gall as an ingredient 
in the vinegar, a mixture which Jesus might certainly be unable to drink, from 
its unpalatableness. More concerned about historical probability than prophetic 
connexion, the second Evangelist, with reference to a Jewish custom, and perhaps 
in accordance with historical fact, converted the vinegar mingled with gall, 
into wine mingled with myrrh, and made Jesus reject this, doubtless from a wish 
to avoid stupefaction. As however the narrative of the vinegar mingled with gall 
reached these two Evangelists in company with the original one of the 
presentation of simple vinegar to Jesus; they were unwilling that this should be 
excluded by the former, and hence placed the two side by side. But in making 
these observations, as has been before remarked, it is not intended to deny that 
such a beverage may have been offered to Jesus before the crucifixion, and 
afterwards vinegar also, since the former was apparently customary, and the 
latter, from the thirst which tormented the crucified, natural: it is merely 
intended to show, that the Evangelists do not narrate this circumstance, and 
under such various forms, because they knew historically that it occurred in 
this or that manner, but because they were convinced dogmatically that it must 
have occurred according to the above prophecy, which however they applied in 
different ways.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>During or immediately after the crucifixion Luke represents Jesus as saying:
<i>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do </i>(v. 34); an 
intercession which is by some limited to the soldiers who crucified him,<sup>†
</sup>by others, extended to the real authors of his death, the Sanhedrists and 
Pilate.<sup>‡ </sup>However accordant such a prayer may be with the principles 
concerning love to enemies elsewhere inculcated by Jesus (Matt. v. 44), and 
however great the internal probability of Luke’s statement viewed in this light: 
still it is to be observed, especially as he stands alone in giving this 
particular, that it may possibly have been taken from the reputed messianic 
chapter, Isa. liii., where in the last verse, the same from which the words: <i>
he was numbered with the transgressors </i><font FACE="Symbol">meta anomwn</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">elogisqh </font>are borrowed, it is said : [Heb. letters] <b>
wlapposh‘iym yapgiya‘</b><i>(he made intercession for the transgressors), </i>
which the LXX. erroneously translate <font FACE="Symbol">dia taV anomiaV autwn 
paredoqh</font><i><font FACE="Arial">, </font>he was delivered for their 
transgressions, </i>but which already the <i>Targum Jonathan </i>renders by <i>
pro peccatis </i>(it should be <i>peccatoribus) deprecatus est. </p>

<p>All the Evangelists agree in stating that two malefactors <font FACE="Symbol">
duo kakourgoi </font>(Matthew and Mark call them <font FACE="Symbol">lhstaV
</font><i>thieves) </i>were crucified, one on each side of Jesus; and Mark, if 
his 28th verse be genuine, sees in this a literal fulfilment of the words: <i>he 
was numbered with the transgressors, </i>which, according to Luke xxii. 37, 
Jesus had the evening before quoted as a prophecy about to be accomplished in 
him. Of the further demeanour of these fellow-sufferers, John says nothing; the 
two first Evangelists represent them as reviling Jesus (Matt. xxvii. 44; Mark 
xv. 32): whereas Luke narrates that only one of them was guilty of this offence, 
and that he was rebuked by the other (xxiii. 39 ff.). In order to reconcile this 
difference, commentators have advanced the supposition, that at first both 
criminals reviled Jesus, but that subsequently one of them was converted by the 
marvellous darkness ; <sup>* </sup>more modern ones have resorted to the 
supposition of an <i>enallage numeri:<sup>† </sup></i>but without doubt those 
only are right who admit a real difference between Luke and his predecessors.<sup>‡
</sup>It is plain that the two first Evangelists knew nothing of the more 
precise details which Luke presents concerning the relation of the two 
malefactors to Jesus. He narrates, namely, that when one of them derided Jesus 
by calling upon him, if he were the Messiah, to deliver himself and them, the 
other earnestly rebuked such mockery of one with whom he was sharing a like 
fate, and moreover as a guilty one with the guiltless, entreating for his own 
part that Jesus would remember him when he should come into his <i>kingdom </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">basileia</font><i>: </i>whereupon Jesus gave him the promise 
that he should that very day be with him <i>in Paradise </i><font FACE="Symbol">
en tw paradeisw</font><i>. </i>In this scene there is nothing to create 
difficulty, until we come to the words which the second malefactor addresses to 
Jesus. For to expect from one suspended on the cross a future coming to 
establish the messianic kingdom, would presuppose the conception of the whole 
system of a dying Messiah, which before the resurrection the apostles themselves 
could not comprehend, and which therefore, according to the above representation 
of Luke, a <i>thief </i>must have been beforehand with them in embracing. This 
is so improbable, that it cannot excite surprise to find many regarding the 
conversion of the thief on the cross as a miracle,<sup>§ </sup>and the 
supposition which commentators call in to their aid,<i> </i>namely, that the man 
was no common criminal, but a political one, perhaps concerned in the 
insurrection of Barabbas,<sup>|| </sup>only serves to render the incident still 
more inconceivable. For if he was an Israelite inclined to rebellion, and bent 
on liberating his nation from the Roman yoke, his idea of the Messiah was 
assuredly the most incompatible with the acknowledgment as such, </p>

<p>of one so completely annihilated in a political view, as Jesus then was. 
Hence we are led to the question, whether we have here a real history and not 
rather a creation of the legend? Two malefactors were crucified with Jesus: thus 
much was indubitably presented by history (or did even this owe its origin to 
the prophecy, Isa. liii. 12?). At first they were suspended by the side of Jesus 
as mute figures, and thus we find them in the narrative of the fourth 
Evangelist, into whose region of tradition only the simple statement, that they 
were crucified with Jesus, had penetrated. But it was not possible for the 
legend long to rest contented with so slight a use of them : it opened their 
mouths, and as only insults were reported to have proceeded from the bystanders, 
the two malefactors were at first made to join in the general derision of Jesus, 
without any more particular account being given of their words (Matt. and Mark). 
But the malefactors admitted of a still better use. If Pilate had borne witness 
in favour of Jesus; if shortly after, a Roman centurion—nay, all nature by its 
miraculous convulsions—had attested his exalted character: so his two 
fellow-sufferers, although criminals, could not remain entirely impervious to 
the impression of his greatness, but, though one of them did indeed revile Jesus 
agreeably to the original form of the legend, the other must have expressed an 
opposite state of feeling, and have shown faith in Jesus as the Messiah (Luke). 
The address of the latter to Jesus and his answer are besides conceived entirely 
in the spirit of Jewish thought and expression; for according to the idea then 
prevalent, paradise was that part of the nether world which was to harbour the 
souls of the pious in the interval between their death and the resurrection: a 
place. in paradise and a favourable remembrance in the future age were the 
object of the Israelite’s petition to God, as here to the Messiah <sup>* </sup>
and it was believed concerning a man distinguished for piety that he could 
conduct those who were present at the hour of his death into paradise.<sup>† </p>

<p>To the cross of Jesus was affixed, according to the Roman custom,<sup>‡ </sup>
a <i>superscriptiion </i><font FACE="Symbol">epigrafh </font>(Mark and Luke), or

consisting according to all the Evangelists in the words: <font FACE="Symbol">o

that this superscription was couched in three different tongues, and the latter 
informs us that the Jewish rulers were fully alive to the derision which this 
form of superscription reflected on their nation, and on this account entreated 
Pilate, but in vain, for an alteration of the terms (v. 21 f.).</p>

<p>Of the soldiers, according to John four in number, who crucified Jesus, the 
Evangelists unanimously relate that they parted the clothes of Jesus among 
themselves by lot. According to the Roman law <i>de bonis damnatorum </i><sup>*</sup> 
the vestments of the executed fell as <i>spolia </i>to the executioners, and in 
so far that statement of the Evangelists has a point of contact with history. 
But, like most of the features in this last scene of the life of Jesus, it has 
also a point of contact with prophecy. It is true that in Matthew the quotation 
of the passage Ps. xxii. 18 is doubtless an interpolation; but on the other hand 
the same quotation is undoubtedly genuine in John (xix. 24)<i>: </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">ina h grafh</font> <font FACE="Symbol">plhrwqh h legousa
</font>(verbally after the LXX.) <font FACE="Symbol">mou eautoiV, kai epi ton 
imatismon mou ebalon</font> <font FACE="Symbol">klhron</font><i>, that the 
scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and 
for my vesture they did cast lots. </i>Here also, according to the assertion of 
orthodox expositors, David the author of the psalm, under divine guidance, in 
the moments of inspiration chose such figurative expressions as had a literal 
fulfilment in Christ.<sup>† </sup>Rather we must say, David, or whoever else may 
have been the author of the psalm, as a man of poetical imagination used those 
expressions as mere metaphors to denote a total defeat; but the petty, prosaic 
spirit of Jewish interpretation, which the Evangelists shared without any fault 
of theirs, and from which orthodox theologians, by their own fault however, have 
not perfectly liberated themselves after the lapse of eighteen centuries, led to 
the belief that those words must be understood literally, and in this sense must 
be shown to be fulfilled in the Messiah. Whether the Evangelists drew the 
circumstance of the casting of lots for the clothes more from historical 
information which stood at their command, or from the prophetic passage which 
they variously interpreted, must be decided by a comparison of their narratives. 
These present the divergency, that while according to the synoptists all the 
clothes were parted by lot, as is evident from the words: <font FACE="Symbol">
diemerisanto</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ta imatia autou, ballonteV klhron</font><i>, 
they parted his garment, casting lots, </i>in Matthew (v. <i>35), </i>and the 
similar turn of expression in Luke (v. 34), but still more decidedly from the 
addition of Mark: <font FACE="Symbol">tiV ti arh</font>, <i>what every man 
should take </i>(v. <i>24): </i>in John it is the <i>coat </i>or <i>tunic, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">citwn </font>alone for which lots are cast, the other 
garments being parted equally (v. 23<i> </i>f.). This divergency is commonly 
thought of much too lightly, and is tacitly treated as if the synoptical 
representation were related to that of John as the indefinite to the definite. 
Kuinöl in consideration of John translates the words <font FACE="Symbol">
diemerizanto ballonteV </font>of Matthew thus: <i>partim dividebant, partim in 
sortem conjiciebant: </i>but the meaning is not to be thus distributed, for the
<font FACE="Symbol">diemerizonto</font><i>, they parted, </i>states <i>what </i>
they did, the <font FACE="Symbol">ballonteV klhron</font><i>, casting lots, how
</i>they did it: besides Kuinöl passes in total silence over the words
<font FACE="Symbol">tiV ti arh, </font>because they undeniably </p>

<p>imply that lots were cast for several articles: while according to John the 
lots had reference only to one garment. If it be now asked, which of the two 
contradictory narratives is the correct one, the answer given from the point of 
view to which the comparative criticism of the gospels has at present attained 
is, that the eye-witness John gives the correct particulars, but the synoptists 
had merely received the indefinite information, that in parting the clothes of 
Jesus the soldiers made use of the lot, and this, from unacquaintance with the 
more minute particulars, they understood as if lots had been cast for all the 
garments of Jesus.<sup>* </sup>But not only does the circumstance that it is 
John alone who expressly cites the passage in the Psalms prove that he had an 
especial view to that passage: but, in general, this divergency of the 
Evangelists is precisely what might be expected from a difference in the 
interpretation of that supposed prophecy. When the psalm speaks of the parting 
of the garments and a casting of lots for the vesture: the second particular is, 
according to the genius of the Hebrew language which abounds in parallelism, 
only a more precise definition of the first, and the synoptists, correctly 
understanding this, make one of the two verbs a participle. One however who did 
not bear in mind this peculiarity of the Hebrew style, or had an interest in 
exhibiting the second feature of the prophecy as specially fulfilled, might 
understand the <i>and, </i>which in reality was indicative only of more precise 
definition, as denoting addition, and thus regard the casting, of lots and the 
distribution as separate acts. Then the <font FACE="Symbol">imatismoV [</font><i>Heb. 
letters</i><font FACE="Symbol">] (</font><b>l<sup>e</sup>bush</b><font FACE="Symbol">)</font><i>
</i>which was originally a synonyme of <font FACE="Symbol">imatia [</font><i>Heb. 
letters</i><font FACE="Symbol">] </font><i>(</i><b>b<sup>e</sup>gadiym</b><i>)
</i>must become a distinct garment, the closer particularization of which, since 
it was not in any way conveyed in the word itself, was left to choice. The 
fourth Evangelist determined it to be the <font FACE="Symbol">citwn </font><i>
tunic, </i>and because he believed it due to his readers to show some cause for 
a mode of procedure with respect to this garment, so different from the equal 
distribution of the others, he intimated that the reason why it was chosen to 
cast lots for the tunic rather than to divide it, probably was that it had no 
seam (<font FACE="Symbol">arrafoV</font>) which might render separation easy, 
but was woven in one piece (<font FACE="Symbol">ufantoV di</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">olou</font>).
<sup>† </sup>Thus we should have in the fourth Evangelist exactly the same 
procedure as we have found on the side of the first, in the history of the 
entrance into Jerusalem: in both cases the doubling of a trait originally 
single, owing to a false interpretation of the in the Hebrew parallelism; the 
only difference being that the first Evangelist in the passage referred to is 
less arbitrary than the fourth is here, for he at least spares us the tracing 
out of the reason why two asses must then have been required for one rider. The 
more evident it thus becomes that the representation of the point in question in 
the different </p>

<p>Evangelists is dependent on the manner in which each interpreted that 
supposed prophecy in the Psalms: the less does a sure historical knowledge 
appear to have had any share in their representation, and hence we remain 
ignorant whether lots were cast on the distribution of the clothes of Jesus, nay 
whether in general a distribution of clothes took place under the cross of 
Jesus; confidently as Justin appeals in support of this very particular to the 
Acts of Pilate, which he had never seen.<sup>* </p>

<p>Of the conduct of the Jews who were present at the crucifixion of Jesus, John 
tells us nothing; Luke represents the people as standing to look on, and only 
the <i>rulers </i><font FACE="Symbol">arconteV </font>and the soldiers as 
deriding Jesus by the summons to save himself if he were the Messiah, to which 
the latter adds the offer of the vinegar (v. 35 ff.); Matthew and Mark have 
nothing here of mockery on the part of the soldiers, but in compensation they 
make not only the <i>chief priests, scribes, </i>and <i>elder; </i>but also the
<i>passers by, </i><font FACE="Symbol">paraporeomenoi </font>vent insults 
against Jesus (v. 39 ff., 29 ff.)<i>. </i>The expressions of these people partly 
refer to former discourses and actions of Jesus; thus, the sarcasm: <i>Thou that 
destroyest the temple and buildest it again in three days, save thyself </i>
(Matt. and Mark), is an allusion to the words of that tenor ascribed to Jesus; 
while the reproach: <i>he saved others, himself he cannot save, </i>or <i>
<font FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">save </font>thyself </i>(in all three), refers 
to his cures. Partly however the conduct of the Jews towards Jesus on the cross, 
is depicted after the same psalm of which Tertullian justly says that it 
contains <i>totam Christi passionem.<sup>† </sup></i>When it is said in Matthew 
and Mark: <i>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads and 
saying: </i><font FACE="Symbol">oi de paraporeuomenoi ablasfhmoun ayton, 
kinonteV taV kefalaV autwn kai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">legonteV</font> (Luke 
says of the <i>rulers </i><font FACE="Symbol">arconteV </font><i>they derided 
him</p>
</i><font FACE="Symbol">
<p>exemukthrizon</font>),<i> </i>this is certainly nothing else than a mere 
reproduction of what stands in Ps. xxii. 8 (LXX.): <i>All they that see me laugh 
me to scorn, they shoot out the lip and shake the head:</i> <font FACE="Symbol">
panteV oi qewrounteV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">me exemukthrisan me, elalhsan en 
ceilesin, ekinhsan</font> <font FACE="Symbol">kefalhn</font><i>; </i>and the 
words which are hereupon lent to the Sanhedrists in Matthew: <i>He trusted in 
God; let him deliver him now if he will have him, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
pepoiqen epi ton qeon, pusasqw nun</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ei qelei auton</font><i>,
</i>are the same with those of the following verse in that Psalm: <i>He trusted 
in the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted 
in him, </i><font FACE="Symbol">hlpusen epi</font> <font FACE="Symbol">Kurion,</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">rusasqw auton, swsatw auton, oti qelei auton</font><i>. </i>
Now though the taunts and shaking of the head on the part of the enemies of 
Jesus may, notwithstanding that the description of them is drawn according to 
the above Old Testament passage, still very probably have really happened: it is 
quite otherwise with the words which are attributed to these mockers. Words 
which, like those above quoted, are in the Old Testameut put into the mouth of 
the enemies of the godly, could not be adopted by the Sanhedrists without their

<p>assuming the character of the ungodly: which they would surely have taken 
care to avoid. Only the Christian legend, if it once applied the Psalm to the 
sufferings of Jesus, and especially to his last hours, could attribute these 
words to the Jewish rulers, and find therein the fulfilment of a prophecy.</p>
<p>The two first Evangelists do not tell us that any one of the twelve was 
present at the crucifixion of Jesus: they mention merely several Galilean women, 
three of whom they particularize: namely, Mary Magdalene; Mary the mother of 
James the Less and of Joses; and, as the third, according to Matthew, the mother 
of the sons of Zebedee, according to Mark, Salome, both which designations are 
commonly understood to relate to the same person (Matt. v. <i>55 </i>f.; Mark v. 
40 f.): according to these Evangelists the twelve appear not yet to have 
reassembled after their flight on the arrest of Jesus.<sup>* </sup>In Luke, on 
the contrary, among <i>all his acquaintance, </i><font FACE="Symbol">panteV oi 
gnwstoi autou</font><i>, </i>whom he represents as beholding the crucifixion (v. 
49) the twelve would seem to be included: but the fourth gospel expressly 
singles out from among the disciples the one <i>whom Jesus loved, </i>i.e. John, 
as present, and among the women, together with Mary Magdalene and the wife of Cl 
eopas, names instead of the mother of James and John, and the mother of Jesus 
himself. Moreover, while according to all the other accounts the acquaintances 
of Jesus stood <i>afar off , </i><font FACE="Symbol">makroqen</font><i>, </i>
according to the fourth gospel John and the mother of Jesus must have been in 
the closest proximity to the cross, since it represents Jesus as addressing them 
from the cross, and appointing John to be his substitute in the filial relation 
to his mother (v. 25 ff.). Olshausen believes that he can remove the 
contradiction which exists between the synoptical statement and the 
presupposition of the fourth gospel as to the position of the friends of Jesus, 
by the conjecture that at first they did indeed stand at a distance, but that 
subsequently some approached near to the cross: it is to be observed, however, 
in opposition to this, that the synoptists mention that position of the 
adherents of Jesus just at the close of the scene of crucifixion and death, 
immediately before the taking down from the cross, and thus presuppose that they 
had retained this position until the end of the scene; a state of the case which 
cannot but be held entirely consistent with the alarm which filled the minds of 
the disciples during those days, and still more with feminine timidity. If the 
heroism of a nearer approach might perhaps be expected from maternal tenderness: 
still, the total silence of the synoptists, as the interpreters of the common 
evangelical tradition, renders the historical reality of that particular 
doubtful. The synoptists cannot have known anything of the presence of the 
mother of Jesus at the cross, otherwise they would have mentioned her as the 
chief person, before all the other women; nor does anything appear to have been 
known of a more intimate relation between her and John: at least in the Acts (i. 
12 f.) the mother of Jesus is supposed to be with the twelve in general, his 
brothers, and the women of the society. It is at least not so easy to understand 
how the memory of that affecting presence and remarkable relation could be lost, 
as to conceive how the idea of them might originate in the circle from which the 
fourth gospel proceeded. If this circle be imagined as one in which the Apostle 
John enjoyed peculiar veneration, on which account our gospel drew him out of 
the trio of the more confidential associates of Jesus, and isolated him as the 
beloved disciple : it will appear that nothing could be more strikingly adapted 
to confirm this relation than the statement that Jesus bequeathed, as it were, 
the dearest legacy, his mother (in reference to whom, as well as to the alleged 
beloved disciple, it must have been a natural question, whether she had left the 
side of Jesus in this last trial), to John, and thus placed this disciple in his 
stead,—made him <i>vicarius Christi.</p>
</i>
<p>As the address of Jesus to his mother and the favourite disciple is peculiar 
to the fourth gospel: so, on the other hand, the exclamation, <i>My God, my God, 
why hast thou forsaken me </i><font FACE="Symbol">hli,</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">hli, lama sabacqani</font><i>; </i>is only found in the two 
first gospels (Matt. v. 46; Mark v. 34). This exclamation, with the mental state 
from which it proceeded, like the agony in Gethsemane, constitutes in the 
opinion of the church a part of the vicarious suffering of Christ. As however in 
this instance also it was impossible to be blind to the difficulties of the 
supposition, that the mere corporeal suffering, united with the external 
depression of his cause, overwhelmed Jesus to such a degree that he felt himself 
forsaken by God, while there have been both before and after him persons who, 
under sufferings equally severe, have yet preserved composure and fortitude: the 
opinion of the church has here also, in addition to the natural corporeal and 
spiritual affliction, supposed as the true cause of that state of mind in Jesus, 
a withdrawal of God from his soul, a consciousness of the divine wrath, which it 
was decreed that he should bear in the stead of mankind, by whom it was deserved 
as a punishment.<sup>† </sup>How, presupposing the dogma of the church 
concerning the person of Christ, a withdrawal of God from his soul is 
conceivable, it is the part of the defenders of this opinion themselves, to 
decide. Was it the human nature in him which felt so forsaken? Then would its 
unity with the divine have been interrupted, and thus the very basis of the 
personality of Christ, according to the above system, removed. Or the divine? In 
that case the second person in the Godhead would have been separated from the 
first. As little can it have been the God-man, consisting of both natures, that 
felt forsaken by God, since the very essence of this is the unity and 
inseparableness of the divine and the human. Thus urged by the 
self-contradiction of this supranaturalistic explanation, to fall </p>

<p>* </sup>Justin, Apol. 1. 50, and elsewhere, even speaks of apostacy and 
denial on the part of all the disciples after the crucifixion.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">784</p>
<p>back on the natural mode of accounting for the above exclamation by the sense 
of external suffering, and yet repelled from the idea that Jesus should have 
been so completely subdued by this, commentators have attempted to mollify the 
sense of the exclamation. It consists of the opening words of Ps. xxii., a 
passage which is classical for this last scene in the life of Jesus. Now this 
psalm begins with a complaining description of the deepest suffering, but in the 
course of its progress soars into joyful hope of deliverance; hence it has been 
supposed that the words which Jesus immediately utters do not give his entire 
experience, and that in thus reciting the first verse he at the same time quotes 
the whole psalm and especially its exulting close, just as if he meant to say: 
It is true that I, like the author of this psalm, appear now forsaken of God, 
but in me, as in him, the divine succour will only be so much the more 
glorified.<sup>* </sup>But if Jesus uttered this exclamation with a view to the 
bystanders, and in order to assure them that his affliction would soon be merged 
in triumph, he would have chosen the means the least adapted to his purpose, if 
he had uttered precisely those words of the Psalm which express the deepest 
misery; and instead of the first verse he would rather have chosen one from the 
10th to the 12th, or from the 20th to the end. If however in that exclamation he 
meant merely to give vent to his own feeling, he would not have chosen this 
verse if his actual experience in these moments had been, not what is there 
expressed, but what is described in the succeeding verses. Now if this 
experience was his own, and if, all supernatural grounds of explanation being 
dismissed, it proceeded from his external calamities; we must observe that one 
who, as the gospels narrate of Jesus, had long included suffering and death in 
his idea of the Messiah, and hence had regarded them as a part of the divine 
arrangements, could scarcely complain of them when they actually arrived as an 
abandonment by God; rather, on the above supposition, we should be led to think 
that Jesus had found himself deceived in the expectations which he had 
previously cherished, and thus believed himself forsaken by God in the 
prosecution of his plan.<sup>† </sup>But we could only resort to snch 
conjectures if the above exclamation of Jesus were shown to have an historical 
foundation. In this respect the silence of Luke and John would not, it is true, 
be so serious a difficulty in our eyes, that we should take refuge in 
explanations like the following: John suppressed the exclamation, lest it should 
serve to countenance the Gnostic opinion, by admitting the inference that the 
Æon which was insusceptible of suffering, departed from Jesus in that moment.<sup>‡
</sup>But the relation of the words of Jesus to the 22nd Psalm does certainly 
render this particular suspicious. If the Messiah was once conceived of as 
suffering, and </p>

Fragments, von Zweck Jesu und seiner Jünger, s. 153.</p>
<p>‡ Schneckenburger, Beiträge, s. 66 f.</p>
<sup>
<p>§ </sup>According to Olshausen, s 495<i>, </i>there is no syllable in this 
speech by which such a meaning is intimated; on the contrary, a secret horror 
had already diffused itself over the minds of the scoffers, and they trembled at 
the thought that Elias might appear in the storm. But when one who attempts to 
give a beverage to Jesus is dissuaded under the pretext of waiting to see <i>if 
Elias would come to save film, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ei ercetai HliaV swswn 
auton</font><i>, </i>this pretext is plainly enough shown to be meant in 
derision, and hence the horror and trembling belong only to the unscientific 
animus of the biblical commentator, which makes him contemplate the history of 
the passion above all else, as a <i>mysterium tremendum, </i>and causes him to 
discover even in Pilate a depth of feeling which is nowhere attributed to this 
Roman in the gospels.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">785</p>
<p>if that psalm was used as a sort of programme of his suffering
<font FACE="Arial">— </font>for which it was by no means necessary as an 
inducement that Jesus should have really quoted one of its verses on the cross 
:—the opening words of the psalm which are expressive of the deepest suffering 
must appear singularly adapted to be put into the mouth of the crucified 
Messiah. In this case the derisive speech<sup>§ </sup>of the bystanders, <i>he 
calleth for Elias, </i>etc., can have had no other origin than this—that the 
wish for a variety of taunts to complete this scene after the model of the 
psalm, was met by the similarity of sound between the <font FACE="Symbol">hli
</font>in the exclamation lent to Jesus, and the name of Elias which was 
associated with the Messiah.*</p>
<p>Concerning the last words which the expiring Jesus was heard to utter, the 
Evangelists differ. According to Matthew and Mark, it was merely a <i>loud 
voice, </i><font FACE="Symbol">fwnh megalh, </font>with which he departed <i>(v. 
50, </i>37); according to Luke it was the petition: <i>Father, into thy hands I 
commend my spirit, </i><font FACE="Symbol">pater, eiV ceiraV sou paraqhsomai</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">to pneuma mou </font>(v. 46); while according to John it was 
on the brief expression: <i>it is finished, </i><font FACE="Symbol">tetelestai</font><i>,
</i>that he bowed his head and expired (v. 30). Here it is possible to reconcile 
the two first Evangelists with one or other of the succeeding ones by the 
supposition, that what the former describe indefinitely as a loud cry, and what 
according to their representation might be taken for an inarticulate expression 
of anguish, the others, with more particularity, give in its precise verbal 
form. It is more difficult to reconcile the two last gospels. For whether we 
suppose that Jesus first commended his soul to God, and hereupon cried: <i>it is 
finished; </i>or vice versa; both collocations are alike opposed to the 
intention of the Evangelists, for the expression of Luke <i>,</i><font FACE="Symbol">kai 
tauta eipwn</font> <font FACE="Symbol">exepneusen</font><i> </i>cannot be 
rendered, as Paulus would have it, by:<i> soon </i>after he had said this, he 
expired; and the very words of the exclamation in John define it as the last 
utterance of Jesus ; the two writers forming different conceptions of the 
closing words. In the account of Luke, the common form of expression for the 
death of Jesus: <font FACE="Symbol">paredwke to pneuma </font><i>(he delivered 
up his spirit) </i>appears to have been interpreted as an actual commending of 
his soul to God on the part of Jesus, and to have been further developed with 
reference to the passage Ps. xxxi. <i>5: (Lord) into thy hands I commend my 
spirit, </i><font FACE="Symbol">(kurie) eiV ceiraV sou</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">paraqhsomai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">to pneuma mou </font>
(LXX.),—a passage which from the strong resemblance of this Psalm to the 22nd 
would be </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">786</p>
<p>apt to suggest itself.<sup>*</sup> Whereas the author of the fourth gospel 
appears to have lent to Jesus an expression more immediately proceeding from his 
position in relation to his messianic office, making him express in the word
<font FACE="Symbol">tetelestai </font><i>is finished </i>the completion of his 
work, or the fulfilment of all the prophecies (with the exception, of course, of 
what could only be completed and fulfilled in the resurrection).</p>
<p>Not only these last words, however, but also the earlier expressions of Jesus 
on the cross, will<sup> </sup>not admit of being ranged in the succession in 
which they are generally supposed. The speeches of Jesus on the cross are 
commonly reckoned to be seven; but so many are not mentioned by any single 
Evangelist, for the two first have only one: the exclamation <i>my God, my God,
</i>etc. <font FACE="Symbol">hli, hli,</font> <font FACE="Symbol">k. t. l.</font> 
Luke has three; the prayer of Jesus for his enemies, the<i> </i>promise to the 
thief, and the commending of his spirit into the hands of the Father; John has 
likewise three, but all different: the address to his mother and the disciple, 
with the exclamations, <font FACE="Symbol">diyw </font>and <i>it is finished </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">tetelestai</font><i>. </i>Now the intercessory prayer, the 
promise and the recommendation of Mary to the care of the disciple, might 
certainly be conceived as following each other: but the <font FACE="Symbol">diyw
</font>and the <font FACE="Symbol">hli </font>come into collision, since both 
exclamations are followed by the same incident, the offering of vinegar by means 
of a sponge on a reed. When to this we add the entanglement of the
<font FACE="Symbol">tetelestai </font>with the <font FACE="Symbol">pater, k. t. 
l.</font>, it should surely be seen and admitted, that no one of the 
Evangelists, in attributing words to Jesus when on the cross, knew or took into 
consideration those lent to him by the others; that on the contrary each 
depicted this scene in his own manner, according as he, or the legend which 
stood at his command, had developed the conception of it to suit this or that 
prophecy or design.</p>
<p>A special difficulty is here caused by the computation of the hours. 
According to all the synoptists the darkness prevailed <i>from the sixth hour 
until the ninth hour, </i><font FACE="Symbol">apo ekthV wraV ewV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">wtaV ennathV </font>(in our reckoning, from twelve at midday 
to three in the afternoon); according to Matthew and Mark, it was about the 
ninth hour that Jesus complained of being forsaken by God, and shortly after 
yielded up the ghost; according to Mark it was <i>the third hour </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">wra trith </font>(nine in the morning) when Jesus was 
crucified (v. 25). On the other hand, John says (xix. 14.) that it was about the 
sixth hour (when according to Mark Jesus had already hung three hours on the 
cross) that Pilate first sat in judgment over him. Unless we are to suppose that 
the sun-dial went backward, as in the time of Hezekiah, this is a contradiction 
which is not to be removed by a violent alteration of the reading, nor by 
appealing to the <font FACE="Symbol">wsei </font>(about) in John, or to the 
inability of the disciples to take note of the hours under such afflictive 
circumstances; at the utmost it might perhaps </p>
