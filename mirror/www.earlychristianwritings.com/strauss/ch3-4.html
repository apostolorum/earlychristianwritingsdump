<p align="center"><font size="4">DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS.</font></p>
<p>§ 133. PRODIGIES ATTENDANT ON THE DEATH OF JESUS.</p>
<p>According to the evangelical accounts, the death of Jesus was accompanied by 
extraordinary phenomena. Three hours before, we are told, a darkness diffused 
itself and lasted until Jesus expired (Matt. xxvii. 45 parall.); in the moment 
of his death the veil of the temple was torn asunder from the top to the bottom, 
the earth quaked, the rocks were rent, the graves were opened, and many bodies 
of departed saints arose, entered into the city, and appeared to many (Mall v. 
51 ff. parall.). These details are very unequally distributed among the 
Evangelists: the first alone has them all; the second and third merely the 
darkness and the rending of the veil: while the fourth knows nothing of all 
these marvels.</p>
<p>We will examine them singly according to their order. The <i>dærkness </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">skotoV </font>which is said to have arisen while Jesus hung 
on the cross,, cannot have been an ordinary eclipse of the sun, caused by the 
interposition of the moon between his disc and the earth,<sup>* </sup>since it 
happened during the Passover, and consequently about the time of the full moon. 
The gospels however do not directly use the terms <font FACE="Symbol">ekleiyiV 
tou hliou </font><i>(eclipse of the sun), </i>the two first speaking only of <i>
darkness </i><font FACE="Symbol">skotoV</font> in general; and though the third 
adds with somewhat more particularity: <font FACE="Symbol">kai eskotisqh o hlioV</font><i>, 
and the sun was darkened, </i>still this might be said of any species of widely 
extended obscuration. Hence it was an explanation which lay near at hand to 
refer this darkness to an atmospheric, instead of an astronomical cause, and to 
suppose that it proceeded from obscuring vapours in the air, such as are 
especially wont to precede earthquakes.<sup>† </sup>That such obscurations of 
the atmospheaæ may be diffused over whole, countries, is true; but not only is 
the statement that the one </p>
<p>* The Evang. Nicodemi makes the Jews very absurdly maintain: <i>there 
happened an eclipse of the sun in the ordinary course </i><font FACE="Symbol">
ekleiyiV hliou gegone kata to eiwqoV</font><i>, </i>c. xi. p. 592, ap. Thilo.</p>
<p>† Thus Paulus and Kuinöl, in loc.; Hase, L. J. § 143; Neander, L. J. Chr s. 
639 f.</p>
<p align="center">788</p>
<p>in question extended <font FACE="Symbol">epi pasan </font>or
<font FACE="Symbol">olhn</font> <font FACE="Symbol">thn ghn</font><i>, </i>i.e., 
according to the most natural explanation, over the entire globe, to be 
subtracted as an exaggeration of the narrator :<sup>* </sup>but also the 
presupposition, evident in the whole tenor of their representation, that the 
darkness had a supernatural cause, appears destitute of foundation from the want 
of any adequate object for such a miracle. Since then, with these accessory 
features the event does not in itself at once carry the conviction of its 
credibility, it is natural to inquire if it have any extrinsic confirmation. The 
fathers of the church appeal in its support to the testimony of heathen writers, 
among whom Phlegon especially in his <font FACE="Symbol">cronikoiV </font>is 
alleged to have noticed the above darkness:<sup>† </sup>but on comparing the 
passage preserved by Eusebius, which is apparently the one of Phiegon alluded 
to, we find that it determines merely the Olympiad, scarcely the year, and in no 
case the season and day of this darkness.<sup>‡ </sup>More modern apologists 
appeal to similar cases in ancient history, of which Wetstein in particular has 
made a copious collection. He adduces from Greek and Roman writers the notices 
of the eclipses of the sun which occurred at the disappearance of Romulus, the 
death of Cæsar,<sup>§ </sup>and similar events; he cites declarations which 
contain the idea that eclipses of the sun betoken the fall of kingdoms and the 
death of kings; lastly he points to Old Testament passages (Isa. l. 3; Joel iii. 
20; Amos viii. 9; comp. Jer. xv. 9) and rabbinical dicta, in which either the 
obscuring of the light of day is described as the mourning garb of God,<sup>||
</sup>or the death of great teachers compared with the sinking of the sun at 
mid-day,<sup>¶ </sup>or the opinion advanced that at the death of exalted 
hierarchical personages, if the last honours are not paid to them, the sun is 
wont to be darkened.<sup>* </sup>But these parallels, instead of being supports 
to the credibility of the evangelical narrative, are so many premises to the 
conclusion, that we have here also nothing more than the mythical offspring of 
universally prevalent ideas,—a Christian legend, which would make all nature put 
on the weeds of mourning to solemnize the tragic death of the Messiah.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>The second prodigy is the rending of the veil of the temple, doubtless the 
inner veil before the Holy of Holies, since the word <font FACE="Symbol">[</font><i>Heb. 
letters</i><font FACE="Symbol">] </font><b>paroketh</b>, used to designate this, 
is generally rendered in the LXX. by <font FACE="Symbol">katapetasma</font><i>.
</i>It was thought possible to interpret this rending of the veil also as a 
natural event, by regarding it as an effect of the earthquake. But, as Lightfoot 
has already justly observed, it is more conceivable that an earthquake should 
rend stationary fixed bodies such as the rocks subsequently mentioned, than that 
it should </p>

<p>tear a pliant, loosely hung curtain. Hence Paulus supposes that the veil of 
the temple was stretched and fastened not only above but also below and at the 
sides. But first, this is a mere conjecture: and secondly, if the earthquake 
shook the walls of the temple so violently, as to tear a veil which even though 
stretched, was still pliant: such a convulsion would rather have caused a part 
of the building to fall, as is said to have been the case in the Gospel of the 
Hebrews : <sup>* </sup>unless it be chosen to add, with Kuinöl, the conjecture 
that the veil was tender from age, and might therefore be torn by a slight 
concussion. That our narrators had no such causes in their minds is proved by 
the fact that the second and third Evangelists are silent concerning the 
earthquake, and that the first does not mention it until after the rending of 
the veil. Thus if this event really happened we must regard it as a miracle. Now 
the object of the divine Providence in effecting such a miracle could only have 
been this: to produce in the Jewish cotemporaries of Jesus a deep impression of 
the importance of his death, and to furnish the first promulgators of the gospel 
with a fact to which they might appeal in support of their cause. But, as 
Schleiermacher has shown, nowhere else in the New Testament, either in the 
apostolic epistles or in the Acts, or even in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in 
connexion with the subject of which it could scarcely fail to be suggested, is 
this event mentioned: on the contrary, with the exception of this bare 
synoptical notice, every trace of it is lost ; which could scarcely have been 
the case if it had really formed a ground of apostolical argument. Thus the 
divine purpose in ordaining this miracle must have totally failed; or, since 
this is inconceivable, it cannot have been ordained for this object— in other 
words, since neither any other object of the miracle, nor yet a mode in which 
the event might happen naturally can be discovered, it cannot have happened at 
all. In another way, certainly, a peculiar relation of Jesus to the veil of the 
temple is treated of in the Epistle to the Hebrews. While before Christ, only 
the priests had access into the holy place, and into the Holy of Holies only the 
high priest might enter once in the year with the blood of atonement; Christ, as 
the eternal high priest, entered by his own blood <i>into the holy place within 
the veil, </i>into the Holy of Holies in heaven, whereby he became the <i>
forerunner, </i><font FACE="Symbol">prodromoV</font><i>, </i>of Christians, and 
opened access to them also, founding an <i>eternal redemption</i>
<font FACE="Symbol">aiwnion</font> <font FACE="Symbol">lutrwsin</font><i> </i>
(vi. 19 f., ix. 6, 12, x. 19 f.). Even Paulus finds in these metaphors so close 
an affinity to our narrative, that he thinks it possible to number the latter 
among those fables which according to Henke’s definitions are to be derived <i>e 
figurato genere dicendi;</i><sup>†</sup><i> </i>at least the event, even if it
</p>
<p>* Hieron. ad Hedib. ep. cxlix. 8 (comp. his Comm. in loc.): <i>In evangelio 
autem, quod hebraicis literis scriptum est, legimus, non velum templi scissum, 
sed superliminare templi mirae magnitudinis corruisse.</p>
</i>
<p>† The possibility of this is admitted by Neander also, but with the 
presupposition of some fact as a groundwork (s. 640 f.).</p>
<p align="center">790</p>
<p>really happened, must have been especially important to the Christians on 
account of its symbolical significance, as interpreted by the images in the 
Epistle to the Hebrews: namely, that by Christ’s death the veil of the Jewish 
worship was rent asunder, and access to God opened to all by means of <i>worship 
in the Spirit. </i>But if, as has been shown, the historical probability of the 
event in question is extremely weak, and on the other hand, the causes which 
might lead to the formation of such a narrative without historical foundation 
very powerful; it is more consistent, with Schleiermacher, entirely to renounce 
the incident as historical, on the ground that so soon as it began to be the 
practice to represent the office of Christ under the images which reign 
throughout the Epistle to the Hebrews, nay, in the very earliest dawn of this 
kind of doctrine, on the first reception of the Gentiles, who were left free 
from the burthen of Jewish observances, and who thus remained without 
participation in the Jewish sacrifices, such representations must have entered 
into the Christian hymns (and the evangelical narratives). <sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>On the succeeding particulars of the earthquake and the rending of the rocks, 
we can only pronounce a judgment in connexion with those already examined. An 
earthquake by which rocks are disparted, is not unprecedented as a natural 
phenomenon: but it also not seldom occurs as a poetical or mythical 
embellishment of the death of a distinguished man; as, for example, on the death 
of Cæsar, Virgil is not content with eclipsing the sun, but also makes the Alps 
tremble with unwonted commotion.<sup>† </sup>Now as we have only been able to 
view the prodigies previously mentioned in the latter light, and as, besides, 
the historical validity of the one before us is weakened by the fact that it 
rests solely on the testimony of Matthew; we must pronounce upon this also in 
the words of Fritzsche: <i>Messiæ obitum atrocibus ostentis, quibus, quantus vir 
quummaxime exspirasset, orbi terrarum indicaretur, illustrem esse oporlebat</i>.<sup>‡
</p>
</sup>
<p>The last miraculous sign at the death of Jesus, likewise peculiar to the 
first Evangelist, is the opening of the graves, the resurrection of many dead 
persons, and their appearance in Jerusalem. To render this incident conceivable 
is a matter of unusual difficulty. It is neither in itself clear how it is 
supposed to have fared with these ancient Hebrew <i>saints, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">agioiV</font><i>,</i><sup>§ </sup>after their resurrection
<sup>|| </sup>nor </p>
<p>* Ueber den Lukas, s.<i> </i>293. Comp. De Wette, exeg. Handb., 1, 1, s. 240.</p>
<p>† Georg. i. 463 ff.</p>
<p>‡ When Hase, § 143, writes: &quot;The earth trembled, mourning for her greatest 
Son,&quot; we see how the historian in speaking of this feature, which he maintains 
to be historical, involuntarily becomes a poet ; and when in the second edition 
the author qualifies the phrase by the addition of an &quot;as it were:&quot; it is 
further evident that his historical conscience had not failed to reproach him 
for the license.</p>
<p>§ Only such must be here thought of, and not <i>sectatores Christi, </i>as 
Kuinöl maintains. In the Evang. Nicodemi, c. xvii., there are indeed adherents 
of Jesus, namely, Simeon (Luke ii.) and his two sons, among those who come to 
life on this occasion; but the majority in this apocryphal book also, and as 
well in the <font FACE="Symbol">anafora</font> <font FACE="Symbol">Pilatou</font><i>,
</i>(Thilo, p. 810), according to Epiphanius, orat. in sepulchrum Chr. 275, 
Jgnat. ad Magnes. ix. and others (comp. Thilo, p. 780 ff.), are Old Testament 
persons, as Adam and Eve, the patriarchs and prophets.</p>
<p>|| Comp. the various opinions in Thilo, p. 783 f.</p>
<p align="center">791</p>
<p>is anything satisfactory to be discovered concerning a possible object for so 
extraordinary a dispensation.<sup>* </sup>Purely in the resuscitated themselves 
the object cannot apparently have lain, for had it been so, there is no 
conceivable ground why they should be all awaked precisely in the moment of the 
death of Jesus, and not each at the period prescribed by the course of his own 
development. But if the conviction of others was the object, this was still less 
attained than in the miracle of the rending of the veil, for not only is any 
appeal to the apparition of the saints totally wanting in the apostolic epistles 
and discourses, but also among the Evangelists, Matthew is the only one by whom 
it is recorded. A special difficulty arises from the position which the 
determination of time: <i>after his resurrection, </i><font FACE="Symbol">meta 
thn egersin</font> <font FACE="Symbol">autou</font><i>, </i>occupies between the 
apparently consecutive stages of the event. For if we connect these words with 
what precedes, and thus suppose that at the moment of the death of Jesus, the 
deceased saints were only reanimated, and did not come out of their graves until 
after his resurrection,— this would have been a torment for the damned rather 
than a guerdon for the holy; if, on the contrary, we unite that determination of 
time to what follows, and thus interpret the Evangelist’s meaning to be, that 
the resuscitated saints did indeed come out of their graves immediately on their 
being reanimated at the moment that Jesus died, but did not go into the city 
until after his resurrection,—any reason for the latter particular is sought in 
vain. It is but an inartificial way of avoiding these difficulties to pronounce 
the whole passage an interpolation, without any critical grounds for such a 
decision.<sup>† </sup>A more dexterous course is pursued by the rationalistic 
expositors, when they endeavour to subtract the miraculous from the event, and 
by this means indirectly to remove the other difficulties. Here, as in relation 
to the rending of the veil, the earthquake is regarded as the chief agent: this, 
it is said, laid open several tombs, particularly those of some prophets, which 
were found empty, because the bodies had either been removed by the shock, or 
become decomposed, or fallen a prey to wild beasts. After the resurrection of 
Jesus, those who were friendly to him in Jerusalem being filled with thoughts of 
resurrection from the dead, these thoughts, together with the circumstance of 
the graves being found empty, excited in them dreams and visions in which they 
believed that they beheld the pious ancestors who had been interred in those 
graves.<sup>‡ </sup>But the fact of the graves being found empty would scarcely, 
even united with the news of the resurrection of Jesus, have sufficed to produce 
such visions, unless there had previously prevailed among the Jews the 
expectation that the Messiah would recall to life the departed saints </p>
<p>* Comp. especially Eichhorn, Einl. in d. N. T. 1, s. 446 ff.</p>
<p>† Stroth, von Interpolationen im Evang. Matth. In Eichhorn’s Repertorium, 9, 
s. 139. It is hardly a preferable expedient to regard the passage as an addition 
of the Greek translator. See Kern, Ueber den Urspr. des Evang. Matth. s. 25 and 
100.</p>
<p>‡<i> </i>Thus Paulus and Kuinöl, in loc. The latter calls this explanation a 
mythical one.</p>
<p align="center">792</p>
<p>of Israel. If however this expectation existed, it would more probably give 
birth to the legend of a resurrection of the saints coincident with the death of 
Jesus than to dreams; whence Hase wisely discards the supposition of dreams, and 
attempts to find a sufficient explanation of the narrative in the emptiness of 
the graves on the one hand, and the above Jewish expectation on the other.<sup>*
</sup>But on a nearer view it appears that if once this Jewish idea existed 
there needed no real opening of the graves in order to give rise to such a 
mythus:<sup>† </sup>accordingly Schneckenburger has left the emptiness of the 
graves out of his calculation. <sup>‡ </sup>When, however, he yet speaks of 
visionary appearances whtch were seen by the adherents of Jesus in Jerusalem, 
under the excitement produced by his resurrection, he is not less inconsequent 
than Hase, when he omits the dreams and yet retains the laying open of the 
graves; for these two particulars being connected as cause and effect, if one of 
them be renounced as unhistorical so also must the other.</p>
<p>In opposition to this view it is remarked, not without an appearance of 
reason, that the above Jewish expectation does not suffice to explain the origin 
of such a mythus<sup>§ </sup>The actual expectation may be more correctly stated 
thus. From the epistles of Paul (i Thess. iv. 16,; comp. i Cor. xv. 22 f.) and 
more decidedly from the Apocalypse (xx. 4 f.), we gather that the first 
Christians anticipated, as a concomitant of the return of Christ, a resurrection 
of the saints, who would thenceforth reign with Christ a thousand years; only at 
the end of this period, it was thought, would the rest of the dead arise, and 
from this second resurrection the former was distinguished as <i>the first 
resurrection </i><font FACE="Symbol">h anastasiV h prwth</font><i>, </i>or <i>
the resurrection of the just </i><font FACE="Symbol">twn dikaiwn</font>(Luke 
xiv. 14 ?), in place of which Justin has <i>the holy resurrection </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">h agia anastasiV</font><i>.</i><sup>|| </sup>But this is the 
Christianized form of the Jewish idea; for the latter referred, not to the 
return, but to the first advent of the Messiah, and to a resurrection of 
Israelites only.<sup> </sup>Now in the statement of Matthew likewise, that 
resurrection is assigned to the first appearance of the Messiah; for what 
reason, however, it is there connected with his death, there is certainly no 
indication in the Jewish expectation taken in and by itself, while in the 
modification introduced by the adherents of Jesus there would appear rather to 
have lain an inducement to unite the resurrection of the saints with his own; 
especially as the connecting of it with his death seems to be in contradiction 
with the primitive Christian idea elsewhere expressed, that Jesus was the <i>
first-begotten from the dead, </i><font FACE="Symbol">prwtotokoV ek twn nekrwn
</font>(Col. i. 18; Rev. 1. 5), <i>the firstfruits of them that sleep, </i>

<p>motives which might in other cases lead to the representation that already at 
the death of Jesus there was a resurrection of saints. First there was an 
external motive: among the prodigies at the death of Jesus an earthquake is 
mentioned, and in describing its violence it was natural to add to the rending 
of the rocks another feature which appears elsewhere in accounts of violent 
earthquakes,<sup>* </sup>namely, the opening of the graves:</p>
<p>here then was an inviting hinge for the resurrection of the saints. But there 
was also an internal motive: according to the ideas early developed in the 
Christian community, the death of Jesus was the specially efficacious point in 
the work of redemption, and in particular the descent into Hades connected with 
it (i Pet. iii. 19 f.) was the means of delivering the previously deceased from 
this abode; <sup>† </sup>hence from these ideas there might result an inducement 
to represent the bonds of the grave as having been burst asunder for the ancient 
saints precisely in the moment of the death of Jesus. Besides, by this position, 
yet more decidedly than by a connexion with the resurrection of Jesus, the 
resuscitation of the righteous was assigned to the first appearance of the 
Messiah, in accordance with the Jewish idea, which might very naturally be 
echoed in such a narrative, in the Judaizing circles of primitive Christendom; 
while at the same time Paul and also the author of the Apocalypse already 
assigned the <i>first resurrection </i>to the second and still future advent of 
the Messiah. It was then apparently with reference to this more developed idea, 
that the words <i>after his resurrection </i>were added as a restriction, 
probably by the author of the first gospel himself.</p>
<p>The synoptists conclude their description of the events at the death of 
Jesus, with an account of the impression which they made more immediately on the 
Roman centurion whose office it was to watch the crucifixion. According to Luke 
(v. 47) this impression was produced by <font FACE="Symbol">to genomenon </font>
<i>(what was done), </i>i.e., since he had beforehand mentioned the darkness, by 
the departure of Jesus with an audible prayer, that being the particular which 
he had last noticed; indeed Mark, as if expounding Luke, represents the 
exclamation: <i>truly this man was the Son of God </i>as being called forth from 
the centurion by the circumstance that Jesus <i>so cried out, and gave up the 
ghost, </i><font FACE="Symbol">outw kraxaV exepneusen</font> (v. 39). Now in 
Luke, who gives a prayer as the last utterance of Jesus, it is possible to 
conceive that this edifying end might impress the centurion with a favourable 
opinion of Jesus: but how the fact of his expiring with a loud cry could lead to 
the inference that he was the Son of God, will in no way appear. Matthew however 
gives the most suitable relation to the words of the centurion, when he 
represents them as being called forth by the earthquake and the other prodigies 
which accompanied the death of Jesus:</p>
<p>were it not that the historical reality of this speech of the centurion must 
stand or fall with its </p>
<p>* See the passages collected by Wetstein.</p>
<p>† See this idea further developed in the Evang. Nicod. c xviii. ff.</p>
<p align="center">794</p>
<p>alleged causes. In Matthew and Mark this officer expresses the conviction 
that Jesus is in truth the <i>Son of God, </i>in Luke, that he is a <i>righteous 
man. </i>The Evangelists in citing the former expression evidently intend to 
convey the idea that a Gentile bore witness to the Messiahship of Jesus; but in 
this specifically Jewish sense the words cannot well have been understood by the 
Roman soldier: we might rather suppose that he regarded Jesus as a son of God in 
the heathen sense, or as an innocent man unjustly put to death, were it not that 
the credibility of the whole synoptical account of the events which signalized 
the death of Jesus being shaken, this, which forms the top stone as it were, 
must also be of doubtful security; especially when we look at the narrative of 
Luke, who besides the impression on the centurion adds that on the rest of the 
spectators, and makes them return to the city with repentance and mourning—a 
trait which appears to, represent, not so probably what the Jews actually felt 
and did, as what in the opinion of the Christians they <i>ought </i>to have felt 
and done.</p>
<p>§ 134. THE WOUND BY A SPEAR IN THE SIDE OF JESUS.</p>
<p>While the synoptists represent Jesus as hanging on the cross from the
<font FACE="Symbol">wra ennath</font><i>, </i>i.e. three in the afternoon, when 
he expired, until the <font FACE="Symbol">oyia</font><i>, </i>i.e. probably 
about six in the evening, without anything further happening to him: the fourth 
Evangelist interposes a remarkable episode. According to him, the Jews, in order 
to prevent the desecration of the coming sabbath, which was a peculiarly 
hallowed one, by the continued exposure of the bodies on the cross, besought the 
Procurator that their legs might be broken and that they might forthwith be 
carried away. The soldiers, to whom this task was committed, executed it on the 
two criminals crucified with Jesus; but when they perceived in the latter the 
signs of life having already become extinct, they held such a measure 
superfluous in his case, and contented themselves with thrusting a spear into 
his side, whereupon there came forth blood and water (xix. 31— 37).</p>
<p>This event is ordinarily regarded as the chief voucher for the reality of the 
death of Jesus, and in relation to it the proof to be drawn from the synoptists 
is held inadequate. According to the reckoning which gives the longest space of 
time, that of Mark, Jesus hung on the cross from the third to the ninth hour, 
that is, six hours, before he died; if, as to many it has appeared probable, in 
the two other synoptists the commencement of the darkness at the sixth hour 
marks also the commencement of the crucifixion, Jesus, according to them, hung 
only three hours living on the cross; and if we presuppose in John the ordinary 
Jewish mode of reckoning the hours, and attribute to him the same opinion as to 
the period of the death of Jesus, it follows, since he makes Pilate pronounce 
judgment on him only about the sixth hour, that Jesus must have died after </p>
<p align="center">795</p>
<p>hanging on the cross not much more than two hours. But crucifixion does not 
in other cases kill thus speedily. This may be inferred from the nature of the 
punishment, which does not consist in the infliction of severe wounds so as to 
cause a rapid loss of blood, but rather in the stretching of the limbs, so as to 
produce a gradual rigidity; moreover it is evident from the statements of the 
Evangelists themselves, for according to them Jesus, immediately before the 
moment which they regard as the last, had yet strength to utter a loud cry, and 
the two thieves crucified with him were still alive after that time; lastly, 
this opinion is supported by examples of individuals whose life has lasted for 
several days on the cross, and who have only at length expired from hunger and 
similar causes.<sup>* </sup>Hence fathers of the church and older theologians 
advanced the opinion, that the death of Jesus, which would not have ensued so 
quickly in a natural way, was accelerated supernaturally, either by himself or 
by God; <sup>† </sup>physicians and more modern theologians have appealed to the 
accumulated corporeal and spiritual sufferings of Jesus on the evening of the 
night prior to his crucifixion ; <sup>‡ </sup>but they also for the most part 
leave open the possibility that what appeared to the Evangelists the 
supervention of death itself, was only a swoon produced by the stoppage of the 
circulation, and that the wound with the spear in the side first consummated the 
death of Jesus.</p>
<p>But concerning this wound itself, the place, the instrument, and the manner 
of its infliction—concerning its object and effects, there has always been a 
great diversity of opinion. The instrument is called by the Evangelist a
<font FACE="Symbol">logch</font><i>, </i>which may equally signify either the 
light javelin or the heavy lance; so that we are left in uncertainty as to the 
extent of the wound. The manner in which the wound was inflicted he describes by 
the verb <font FACE="Symbol">nussein</font><i>, </i>which sometimes denotes a 
mortal wound, sometimes a slight scratch, nay, even a thrust which does not so 
much as draw blood; hence we are ignorant of the depth of the wound : though 
since Jesus, after the restirrection, makes Thomas lay only his fingers in the 
print of the nails, but, in or even merely on the wound in the side, his hand 
(John xx. 27),<i> </i>the stroke of the spear seems to have made a considerable 
wound. But the question turns mainly on the place in which the wound was made. 
This John describes as the <font FACE="Symbol">pleura </font><i>side, </i>and 
certainly if the spear entered the left side between the ribs and penetrated 
into the heart, death must inevitably have ensued: but the above expression may 
just as properly imply the right side as the left, and in either side any spot 
from the shoulder to the hip. Most of these points indeed would be at once 
decided, if the object of the soldier had been to kill Jesus, supposing he 
should not be already dead; in this case he would doubtless have pierced Jesus 
in the </p>
<p>* The instances are collected in Paulus, exeg. Handb., 3, b. s. 781 ff.<i>;
</i>Winer, bibl. Realwörterb. 1, s. 672 ff.; and Hase, § 144.</p>

<p>most fatal place, and as deeply as possible, or rather, have broken his legs, 
as was done to the two thieves: but since he treated Jesus otherwise than his 
fellow sufferers, it is evident that in relation to him he had a different 
object, namely, in the first place to ascertain by this stroke of the spear, 
whether death had really taken place—a conclusion which he believed might 
securely be drawn from the flowing of blood and water out of the wound.</p>
<p>But this result of the wound is in fact the subject on which there is the 
least unanimity. The fathers of the Church, on the ground that blood no longer 
flows from corpses, regarded the <i>blood and water, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
aima kai udwr</font><i>, </i>which flowed from the corpse of Jesus as a miracle, 
a sign of his superhuman nature.<sup>* </sup>More modern theologians, founding 
on the same experience, have interpreted the expression as a hendiadys, implying 
that the blood still flowed, and that this was a sign that death had not yet, or 
not until now taken place.<sup>† </sup>As, however, blood is itself a fluid, the
<i>water </i><font FACE="Symbol">udwr</font> added to the <i>blood </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">aima </font>cannot signify merely the fluid state of the 
latter, but must denote a peculiar admixture which the blood flowing from the 
side of Jesus contained. To explain this to themselves, and at the same time 
obtain the most infallible proof of death, others have fallen on the idea that 
the water mixed with the blood came out of the pericardium, which had been 
pierced by the spear, and in which, especially in such as die under severe 
anguish, a quantity of fluid is said to be accumulated.<sup>‡ </sup>But—besides 
that the piercing of the pericardium is a mere supposition—on the one hand, the 
quantity of such fluid, where no dropsy exists, is so trifling, that its 
emission would not be perceptible ; and on the other hand, it is only a single 
small spot in front of the breast where the pericardium can be so struck that an 
emission outward is possible: in all other cases, whatever was emitted would be 
poured into the cavity of the thorax.<sup>§ </p>
</sup>
<p>Without doubt the idea which was present in the Evangelist’s mind was rather 
the fact, which may be observed in every instance of blood-letting, that the 
blood, so soon as it has ceased to take part in the vital process, begins to 
divide itself into <i>placenta </i>and <i>serum; </i>and he intended by 
representing this separation as having already taken place in the blood of 
Jesus, to adduce a proof of his real death.<sup>|| </sup>But whether this 
outflow of blood and water in perceptible separation be a possible proof of 
death,—whether Hase and Winer be right when they maintain that on deep incisions 
in corpses the blood sometimes flows in this decomposed state; or the fathers, 
when they deem this so unprecedented that it must be regarded as a miracle in 
Jesus,—this is another question. A distinguished anatomist has explained the 
state of the fact to me in the </p>

<p align="center">797</p>
<p>following manner : <sup>* </sup>Ordinarily, within an hour after death the 
blood begins to coagulate in the vessels, and consequently no longer to flow on 
incisions; only by way of exception in certain species of death, as nervous 
fevers, or suffocation, does the blood retain its fluidity in the corpse. Now if 
it be chosen to place the death on the cross under the category of 
suffocation—which, however, from the length of time that crucified persons have 
often remained alive, and in relation to Jesus especially, from his being said 
to have spoken to the last, appears impracticable; or if it be supposed that the 
wound in the side followed so quickly on the instant of death that it found the 
blood still fluid,—a supposition which is discordant with the narratives, for 
they state Jesus to have been already dead at three in the afternoon, while the 
bodies must have been taken away only at six in the evening: then, if the spear 
struck one of the larger blood vessels, blood would have flowed, but without 
water; if, however, Jesus had already been dead about an hour, and his corpse 
was in the ordinary state: nothing at all would have flowed. Thus either blood 
or nothing: in no case blood and water, because the <i>serum </i>and <i>placenta
</i>are not separated in the vessels of the corpse as in the basin after 
blood-letting. Hardly then had the author of this trait in the fourth gospel 
himself seen the <font FACE="Symbol">aima kai udwr </font>flowing out of the 
side of Jesus, as a sign that his death had taken place; rather, because after 
blood-letting he had seen the above separation take place in the blood as it 
lost its vitality, and because he was desirous to show a certain proof of the 
death of Jesus, he represented those separate ingredients as flowing out of his 
wounded corpse.</p>
<p>The Evangelist assures us, with the most solicitous earnestness, that this 
really happened to Jesus, and that his account is trustworthy, as being founded 
on personal observation (v. 35). According to some, he gives this testimony in 
opposition to docetic Gnostics, who denied the true corporeality of Jesus:<sup>†
</sup>but wherefore then the mention of the <i>water? </i>According to others, 
on account of the noteworthy fulfilment of two prophecies by that procedure with 
respect to the body of Jesus<sup>‡ </sup>But, as Lücke himself says, though John 
does certainly elsewhere, even in subordinate points, seek a fulfilment of 
prophecy, he nowhere attaches to it so extraordinary a weight as he would here 
have done according to this supposition. Hence it appears the most natural 
supposition that the Evangelist intended by those assurances to confirm the 
truth of the death of Jesus,<sup>§ </sup>and that he merely appended the 
reference to the fulfilment of Scripture as a secondary illustrative addition.

<p>of the fourth gospel, there existed a suspicion that the death of Jesus was 
only apparent, does not suffice, in the paucity of information at our command 
concerning that period, to prove that a suspicion so easy of suggestion had not 
actually to be combated in the circle in which the above gospel arose, and that 
it may not have given occasion to the adduction of proofs not only of the 
resurrection of Jesus, but also of his death.<sup>* </sup>Even in the Gospel of 
Mark a similar effort is visible. When this Evangelist, in narrating Joseph’s 
entreaty for the body of Jesus, says: <i>And Pilate marvelled if he were alreadj 
dead </i>(v. 44): this suggests the idea that he lent to Pilate an astonishment 
which he must have heard expressed by many of his cotemporaries concerning the 
rapidity with which the death of Jesus had ensued; and when he proceeds to state 
that the procurator obtained from the centurion certain information that Jesus
<i>had been some time dead,</i><font FACE="Symbol">palai apeqane</font><i>: </i>
it appears as if he wished, in silencing the doubt of Pilate, to silence that of 
his cotemporaries also; but in that case he can have known nothing of a wound 
with a spear, and its consequences, otherwise he would not have left unnoticed 
this securest warrant of death having really taken place: so that the 
representation in John has the appearance of being a fuller development of a 
tendency of the legend already visible in Mark. </p>
<p>This view of John’s narrative is further confirmed by his citation of Old 
Testament passages, as fulfilled in this event. In the stroke of the spear he 
sees the fulfilment of Zech. xii. 10 (better translated by John than by the 
LXX.), where Jehovah says to the Israelites [Heb. letters] <b>w<sup>e</sup>hibbiytu 
’elay ’eth ’asher</b> <i>they shall look on him whom they have pierced, </i>in 
the sense, that they will one day return to him whom they had so grievously 
offended.<sup>† </sup>The word [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>daqar</b> <i>to pierce,
</i>understood literally, expresses an act which appears more capable of being 
directed against a man than against Jehovah: this interpretation is supported by 
the variation in the reading [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>’elayu</b> ; and it must 
have been confirmed by the succeeding context, which proceeds in the third 
person thus: <i>and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, 
and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his 
first-born. </i>Hence the Rabbins interpreted this passage of the Messiah <i>ben 
Joseph, </i>who would be pierced by the sword in battle,<sup>‡ </sup>and the 
Christians might refer it, as they did so many passages in Psalms of 
lamentation, to their Messiah, at first understanding the piercing either 
figuratively or as implying the nailing of the hands (and feet) in crucifixion 
(comp. Rev. i. 7); until at last some one, who desired a more decisive proof of 
death than crucifixion in itself afforded, interpreted it as a special piercing 
with the spear.</p>
<p>If then this trait of the piercing with the spear proceeded from the combined 
interests of obtaining a proof of death, and a literal </p>

</i>
<p align="center">799</p>
<p>fulfilment of a prophecy: the rest must be regarded as merely its preparatory 
groundwork. The piercing was only needful as a test of death, if Jesus had to be 
early taken down from the cross, which according to Jewish law (Deut. xxi. 22; 
Josh. viii, 29, x. 26, f.—an exception occurs in 2<i> </i>Sam. xxi. 6 ff.<sup>*
</sup>) must in any case be before night; but in particular in the present 
instance (a special circumstance which John alone notes), before the 
commencement of the passover. If Jesus died unusually soon, and if the two who 
were crucified with him were yet to be taken down at the same time, the death of 
the latter must be hastened by violent means. This might be done likewise by 
means of a stroke of the spear: but then the piercing, which in Zech. xii. 10 
was predicted specially of the Messiah, would equally happen to others. Thus in 
their case it would be better to choose the breaking of the legs, which would 
not, indeed, instantaneously superinduce death, but which yet made it ultimately 
certain as a consequence of the mortification produced by the fracture. It is 
true that the <i>crurifragium </i>appears nowhere else in connexion with 
crucifixion among the Romans, but only as a separate punishment for slaves, 
prisoners of war, and the like.<sup>† </sup>But it was not the less suitable in 
a prophetic point of view; for was it not said of the Paschal lamb with which 
Jesus was elsewhere also compared (x Cor. V. <i>7): not a bone of him shall be 
broken </i>(Exod. xii. 46)? So that both the prophecies were fulfilled, the one 
determining what should happen exclusively to Jesus, the other what should 
happen to his fellow-sufferers, but not to him.</p>
<p>§ 135.<i> </i>BURIAL OF JESUS.</p>
<p>According to Roman custom the body of Jesus must have remained suspended 
until consumed by the weather, birds of prey, and corruption; <sup>‡ </sup>
according to the Jewish, it must have been interred in the dishonourable burying 
place assigned to the executed : <sup>§ </sup>but the evangelical accounts 
inform us that a distinguished adherent of the deceased begged his body of the<i>
</i>procurator, which, agreeably to the Roman law,<sup>|| </sup>was not refused, 
but was immediately delivered to him (Matt. xxvii. 57<i> </i>parall.). This man, 
who in all the gospels is named Joseph, and said to be derived from Arimathea, 
was according to Matthew a rich man and a disciple of Jesus, but the latter, as 
John adds, only in secret; the two intermediate Evangelists describe him as an 
honourable member of the high council, in which character, Luke remarks, he had 
not given his voice for the condemnation of Jesus, and they both represent him 
as cherishing messianic expectations. That we have here a personal description 
gradually developed into more and more preciseness is evident. In </p>

<p align="center">800</p>
<p>the first gospel Joseph is a disciple of Jesus—and such must have been the 
man who under circumstances so unfavourable did not hesitate to take charge of 
his body; that, according to the same gospel, he was a <i>rich man </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">anqrwpoV plousioV </font>already reminds us of Isa. liii. 9, 
where it is said [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>wayyitten ’eth-resha‘iym qibro 
w’eth-‘ashiyr bemothayw</b> which might possibly be understood of a burial with 
the rich, and thus become the source at least of this predicate of Joseph of 
Arimathea. That he entertained messianic ideas, as Luke and Mark add, followed 
of course from his relation to Jesus; that he was a <i>counsellor, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">bouleuthV</font>, as the same Evangelists declare, is 
certainly a new piece of information: but that as such he could not have 
concurred in the condemnation of Jesus was again a matter of course; lastly, 
that he had hitherto kept his adherence to Jesus a secret, as John observes, 
accords with the peculiar position in relation to Jesus which this Evangelist 
gives to certain exalted adherents, especially to Nicodemus, who is subsequently 
associated with Joseph. Hence it must not he at once supposed that the 
additional particulars which each succeeding Evangelist gives, rest on 
historical information which he possessed over and above that of his 
predecessors.</p>
<p>While the synoptists represent the interment of Jesus as being performed by 
Joseph alone, with no other beholders than the women, John, as we have observed, 
introduces Nicodemus as an assistant; a particular, the authenticity of which 
has been already considered in connexion with the first appearance of Nicodemus.<sup>*
</sup>This individual brings spices for the purpose of embalming Jesus; a 
mixture of myrrh and aloes, in the quantity of about a hundred pounds. In vain 
have commentators laboured to withdraw from the word <font FACE="Symbol">litra</font><i>,
</i>which John here uses, the signification of the Latin <i>libra, </i>and to 
substitute a smaller weight: <sup>† </sup>the above surprising quantity is, 
however, satisfactorily accounted for by the remark of Olshausen, that the 
superfluity was a natural expression of the veneration of those men for Jesus. 
In the fourth gospel the two men perform the office of embalming immediately 
after the taking down of the body from the cross, winding it in linen clothes 
after the Jewish practice; in Luke the women, on their return home from the 
grave of Jesus, provide spices and ointments, in order to commence the embalming 
after the sabbath (xxiii. 16, xxiv. 1); in Mark they do not buy the <i>sweet 
spices </i><font FACE="Symbol">arwmata </font>until the sabbath is past (xvi. 
1); while in Matthew there is no mention of an embalming of the body of Jesus, 
but only of its being wrapped in a <i>clean linen cloth </i>(xxvii. 59).</p>
<p>Here it has been thought possible to reconcile the difference between Mark 
and Luke in relation to the time of the purchase of the spices, by drawing over 
one of the two narrators to the side of the other. It appeared the most easy to 
accommodate Mark to Luke by the supposition of an <i>enallage temporum; </i>his 
verb </p>

<font FACE="Symbol">
<p>hgorasan</font><i>, they bought, </i>used in connexion with the day after the 
sabbath, being taken as the pluperfect, and understood to imply, in accordance 
with the statement of Luke, that the women had the spices in readiness from the 
evening of the burial.<sup>* </sup>But against this reconciliation it has 
already been remarked with triumphant indignation by the Fragmentist, that the 
aorist, standing between a determination of time and the statement of an object, 
cannot possibly signify anything else than what happened at that time in 
relation to that object, and thus the words <font FACE="Symbol">hgorasan arwmata</font><i>, 
they bought sweet spices, </i>placed between <font FACE="Symbol">diagenomenou

and <font FACE="Symbol">ina elqousai</font> <font FACE="Symbol">aleiywsin auton</font><i>, 
that they might come and anoint him, </i>can only signify a purchase made after 
the sabbath had elapsed.<sup>† </sup>Hence Michaelis, who undertook to vindicate 
the histories of the burial and resurrection from the charge of contradiction 
urged by the Fragmentist, betook himself to the opposite measure, and sought to 
conform Luke to Mark. When Luke writes: <font FACE="Symbol">upostreyasai de 
htoimasan arwmata kai mura</font><i>, and they returned, and bought sweet spices 
and ointments, </i>he does not, we are told, mean that they had made this 
purchase immediately after their return, and consequently on the evening of the 
burial: on the contrary, by the addition <font FACE="Symbol">kai to men sabbatov 
hsucasan</font> <font FACE="Symbol">kata thn entolhn</font><i>, and rested the 
sabbath day, according to the commandment, </i>he himself gives us to understand 
that it did not happen until the sabbath was past, since between their return 
from the grave and the commencement of the sabbath at six in the evening, there 
was no time left for the purchase.<sup>‡ </sup>But when Luke places his
<font FACE="Symbol">htoimasan </font><i>(they prepared) </i>between

signify something occurring after the rest of the sabbath, as in Mark the 
similarly placed word <font FACE="Symbol">hgorasan </font>can signify something 
which had happened before the sabbath. Hence more recent theologians have 
perceived that each of these two Evangelists must be allowed to retain the 
direct sense of his words; nevertheless they have believed it possible to free 
both the one and the other from the appearance of error by the supposition that 
the spices prepared before the sabbath were not sufficient, and that the women, 
agreeably to Mark’s statement, really bought an additional stock after the 
sabbath.<sup>§ </sup>But there must have been an enormous requirement of spices 
if first the hundred pounds weight contributed by Nicodemus had not sufficed, 
and on this account the women on the evening before the sabbath had laid ready 
more spices, and then these too were found insufficient, so that they had to buy 
yet more on the morning after the sabbath.</p>

<p>contradiction which exists between the two intermediate Evangelists unitedly 
and the fourth, namely, that according to the latter Jesus was embalmed with a 
hundred weight of ointment before being laid in the grave, while according to 
the former the embalming was deferred until after the sabbath. But as far as the 
quantity was concerned, the hundred pounds of myrrh and aloes were more than 
enough: that which was wanting, and had to be supplied after the sabbath, could 
only relate to the manner, <i>i.e. </i>that the spices had not yet been applied 
to the body in the right way—because the process had been interrupted by the 
arrival of the sabbath.<sup>* </sup>But, if we listen to John, the interment of 
Jesus on the evening of his death was performed <font FACE="Symbol">kaqwV eqoV 
esti</font> <font FACE="Symbol">toiV IoudaioiV entafiazein</font><i>, as the 
manner of the Jews is to bury, </i>i.e. <i>rite, </i>in due form, the corpse 
being wound in the <i>linen clothes </i><font FACE="Symbol">oqonia </font><i>
with the spices</i><font FACE="Symbol"> meta twn arwmatwn </font>(v. 40), which 
constituted the whole of Jewish embalming, so that according to John nothing was 
wanting in relation to the manner ;<sup>† </sup>not to mention that if the 
women, as Mark and Luke state, bought fresh spices and placed them in readiness, 
the embalming of Nicodemus must have been defective as to quantity also. Thus in 
the burial of Jesus as narrated by John nothing objective was wanting: 
nevertheless, it has been maintained that subjectively, as regarded the women, 
it had not been performed, i.e. they were ignorant that Jesus had already been 
embalmed by Nicodemus and Joseph.<sup>‡ </sup>One is astonished that such a 
position can be advanced, since the synoptists expressly state that the women 
were present at the interment of Jesus, and beheld, not merely the place (<font FACE="Symbol">pou 
tiqetai</font><i>, </i>Mark), but also the manner in which he was interred (<font FACE="Symbol">wV 
eteqh</font>, Luke).</p>
<p>There is a third divergency relative to this point between Matthew and the 
rest of the Evangelists, in so far as the former mentions no embalming either 
before or after the sabbath. This divergency, as it consists merely in the 
silence of one narrator, has been hitherto little regarded, and even the 
Fragmentist admits that the wrapping of the body in a clean linen cloth, 
mentioned by Matthew, involves also the Jewish method of embalming. But in this 
instance there might easily be drawn an argument <i>ex silentio. </i>When we 
read in the narrative of the anointing at Bethany the declaration of Jesus, that 
the woman by this deed had anointed his body for burial (Matt. xxvi. 12 
parall.): this has indeed its significance in all the narratives, but a 
peculiarly striking one in Matthew, according to whose subsequent narrative no 
anointing took place at the burial of Jesus,<sup>§ </sup>and this fact appears 
to be the only sufficient explanation of the special importance which the 
Evangelical tradition attached to the action of the woman. if he who was revered 
as the Messiah did not, under the pressure of unfavourable circumstances, 
receive at </p>

<p align="center">803</p>
<p>his burial the due honour of embalmment: then must the thoughts of his 
adherents revert with peculiar complacency to an event in the latter part of his 
life, in which a humble-minded female votary, as if foreboding that this honour 
would be denied to him when dead, rendered it to him while yet living. Viewed in 
this light the different representation of the anointing in the other 
Evangelists would have the appearance of a gradual development of the legend. In 
Mark and Luke it still remains, as in Matthew, that the corpse of Jesus is not 
really embalmed: but, said the legend, already outstepping the narrative of the 
first gospel, the embalming was designed for him,—this intention was the motive 
for the resort of the women to his grave on the morning after the sabbath, and 
its execution was only prevented by the resurrection. In the fourth gospel, on 
the other hand, this anointing, from being first performed on him by 
anticipation while he was yet living, and then intended for him when dead, 
resolved itself into an actual embalming of his body after death: in conjunction 
with which, however, after the manner of legendary formations, the reference of 
the earlier anointing to the burial of Jesus was left standing.</p>
<p>The body of Jesus, according to all the narrators, was forthwith deposited in 
a tomb hewn out of a rock, and closed with a great stone. Matthew describes this 
tomb as <font FACE="Symbol">kainon</font><i>, new; </i>an epithet which Luke and 
John more closely determine by stating that no man had yet been laid therein. We 
may observe in passing, that there is as much reason for suspicion with respect 
to this newness of the grave, as with respect to the unridden ass in the history 
of the entrance of Jesus, since here in the same way as there, the temptation 
lay irresistibly near, even without historical grounds, to represent the sacred 
receptacle of the body of Jesus as never having been polluted by any corpse. But 
even in relation to this tomb the Evangelists exhibit a divergency. According to 
Matthew it was the property of Joseph, who had himself caused it to be hewn in 
the rock; and the two other synoptists also, since they make Joseph 
unhesitatingly dispose of the grave, appear to proceed on the same 
presupposition. According to John, on the contrary, Joseph’s right of property 
in the grave was not the reason that Jesus was laid there; but because time 
pressed, he was deposited in the new sepulchre, which happened to be in a 
neighbouring garden. Here again the harmonists have tried their art on both 
sides. Matthew was to be brought into agreement with John by the observation, 
that a manuscript of his gospel omits the <font FACE="Symbol">autou</font> <i>
(his own) </i>after <font FACE="Symbol">mnhmeiw</font>; while an ancient 
translation read, instead of <font FACE="Symbol">o elatomhsen </font><i>(which 
he had hewn</i>),—<font FACE="Symbol">o hn</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
lelatomenon</font><i> (which was hewn) </i>:<sup>* </sup>as if these alterations 
were not obviously owing already to harmonizing efforts. Hence the opposite side 
has been taken, and it has been remarked that the words of John by no means 
exclude the possibility that Joseph may have been the owner of the tomb, since 
both reasons—the </p>
<p>* Michaclis, ut sup. s. <i>45 </i>ff<i>.</p>
</i>
<p align="center">804</p>
<p>vicinity, and the fact that the grave belonged to Joseph—may have 
co-operated.<sup>* </sup>But the contrary is rather the truth:</p>
<p>namely, that the vicinity of the grave when alleged as a motive, excludes the 
fact of possession: a house in which I should take shelter from a shower, 
because it is near, would not be my own; unless indeed I were the owner of two 
houses, one near and one more distant, of which the latter was my proper 
dwelling: and in like manner a grave, in which a person lays a relative or 
friend who does not himself possess one, because it is near, cannot be his own, 
unless he possess more than one, and intend at greater leisure to convey the 
deceased into the other; which however in our case, since the near grave was 
from its newness adapted above all others for the interment of Jesus, is not 
easily conceivable. If according to this the contradiction subsists, there does 
not appear in the narratives themselves any ground for decision in favour of the 
one or of the other.<sup>† </p>

<p>§ 136. THE WATCH AT THE GRAVE OF JESUS.</p>
<p>On the following day, the Sabbath,<sup>‡ </sup>the chief priests and 
Pharisees, according to Matthew (xxvii. 62 ff.) came to Pilate, and with 
reference to the prediction of Jesus, that he should rise again after three 
days, requested him to place a watch by his grave, lest his disciples should 
take occasion from the expectation which that prediction had awakened, to steal 
his body and then spread a report that he was risen again. Pilate granted their 
request, and accordingly they went away, sealed the stone, and placed the watch 
before the grave. The subsequent resurrection of Jesus (we must here anticipate 
so far), and the angelic appearances which accompanied it, so terrified the 
guards, that they became <i>as dead men, </i><font FACE="Symbol">wsei nekroi</font>,—forthwith, 
however, hastened to the city and gave an account of the event to the chief 
priests. The latter, after having deliberated on the subject in an assembly with 
the elders, bribed the soldiers to pretend that the disciples had stolen the 
body by night; whence, the narrator adds, this report was disseminated, and was 
persisted in up to his time (xxviii. 4, 11 ff.).</p>
<p>In this narrative, peculiar to the first gospel, critics have found all kinds 
of difficulties, which have been exposed with the most acumen by the author of 
the Wolfenbüttel Fragments, and after him </p>
<p>* Kuinöl, in Matth. p. 786; Hase, § 145; Tholuck, Comm. s. 320.</p>
<p>† A confusion of the <font FACE="Symbol">khpoV </font><i>garde;: </i>near to 
the place of execution, where according to John Jesus was buried, with the 
garden of Gethsemane, where he was taken prisoner, appears to have given rise to 
the statement of the Evang. Nicodemi, that Jesus was crucified
<font FACE="Symbol">en tw khpw, opou epiasqh </font><i>in the garden where he 
was apprehended. </i>C. ix. p. 580, ap. Thilo.</p>
<p>‡ <font FACE="Symbol">Th epaurion, htiV esti meta thn paraskeuhn </font><i>
(the next day, that followed the day of the preparation), </i>is certainly a 
singular periphrasis for the Sabbath, for it is a strangely inappropriate mode 
of expression to designate a solemn day, as the day after the previous day: 
nevertheless we must abide by this meaning so long as we are unable to evade it 
in a more natural manner than Schneckenburger in his chronology of the Passion 
week, Beitrage, s. 3 ff.</p>
<p align="center">805</p>
<p>by Paulus.<sup>* </sup>The difficulties lie first of all in this: that 
neither the requisite conditions of the event, nor its necessary consequences, 
are presented in the rest of the New Testament history. As regards the former, 
it is not to be conceived how the Sanhedrists could obtain the information, that 
Jesus was to return to life three days after his death: since there is no trace 
of such an idea having existed even among his disciples. They say: <i>We 
remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, </i>etc. If we are to 
understand from this that they remembered to have heard him speak to that 
effect; Jesus, according to the evangelical accounts, never spoke plainly of his 
resurrection in the presence of his enemies; and the figurative discourses which 
remained unintelligible to his confidential disciples, could still less be 
understood by the Jewish hierarchs, who were less accustomed to his mode of 
thought and expression. If, however, the Sanhedrists merely intend to say, that 
they had heard from others of his having given such a promise: this intelligence 
could only have proceeded from the disciples; but as these had not, either 
before or after the death of Jesus, the slightest anticipation of his 
resurrection, they could not have excited such an anticipation in others ;—not 
to mention that we have been obliged to reject as unhistorical the whole of the 
predictions of the resurrection lent to Jesus in the gospels. Equally 
incomprehensible with this knowledge on the part of the enemies of Jesus, is the 
silence of his friends, the Apostles and the other Evangelists besides Matthew, 
concerning a circumstance so favourable to their cause. It is certainly applying 
too modern a standard to the conduct of the disciples to say with the 
Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist, that they must have entreated from Pilate a letter 
under his seal in attestation of the fact that a watch had been set over the 
grave: but it must be held surprising that in none of the apostolic speeches is 
there anywhere an appeal to so striking a fact, and that even in the gospels, 
with the exception of the first, it has left no discoverable trace An attempt 
has been made to explain this silence from the consideration, that the bribing 
of the guards by the Sanhedrim had rendered an appeal to them fruitless : <sup>†
</sup>but truth is not so readily surrendered to such obvious falsehoods, and at 
all events, when the adherents of Jesus had to defend themselves before the 
Sanhedrim, the mention of such a fact must have been a powerful weapon. The 
cause is already half given up when its advocates retreat to the position, that 
the disciples probably did not become acquainted with the true cause of the 
event immediately, but only later, when the soldiers began to betray the secret.<sup>‡
</sup>For even if the guards in the first instance merely set afloat the tale of 
the theft, and thus admitted that they had been placed by the grave, the 
adherents of Jesus could already construe for themselves the real state of the 
case, and might boldly </p>

</i>506.</p>
<p>‡ Michaclis, ut sup.</p>
<p align="center">806</p>
<p>appeal to the guards, who must have been witnesses of something quite 
different from the theft of a corpse. But lest we be told of the invalidity of 
an argument drawn from the merely negative fact of silence, there is something 
positive narrated concerning a part of the adherents of Jesus, namely, the 
women, which is not reconcilable with the fact of a watch being placed at the 
grave. Not only do the women who resort to the grave on the morning after the 
Sabbath, intend to complete the embalming which they could not hope to be 
permitted to do, if they knew that a watch was placed before the grave, and that 
this was besides sealed : <sup>* </sup>but according to Mark their whole 
perplexity on their way to the grave turns upon the question, who will roll away 
the stone for them from the grave; a clear proof that they knew nothing of the 
guards, since these either would not have allowed them to remove the stone, 
however light, or if they would have allowed this, would also have helped them 
to roll away a heavier one; so that in any case the difficulty as to the weight 
of the stone would have been superfluous. But that the placing of the watch 
should have remained unknown to the women is, from the attention which 
everything relative to the end of Jesus excited in Jerusalem (Luke xxiv. 18), 
highly improbable.</p>
<p>But within the narrative also, every feature is full of difficulties, for, 
according to the expression of Paulus, no one of the persons who appear in it, 
acts in accordance with his character. That Pilate should have granted the 
request of the Jewish magistrates for a watch, I will not say without 
hesitation, but so entirely without ridicule, must be held surprising after his 
previous conduct <sup>† </sup>such minor particulars might however be merely 
passed over by Matthew in his summary mode of recounting the incidents. It is 
more astonishing that the guards should have been so easily induced to tell a 
falsehood which the severity of Roman discipline made so dangerous, as that they 
had failed in their duty by sleeping on their post; especially as, from the bad 
understanding which existed between the Sanhedrim and the procurator, they could 
not know how far the mediation promised by the former would avail. But the most 
inconceivable feature is the alleged conduct of the Sanhedrim. The difficulty 
which lies in their going to the heathen procurator on the Sabbath, defiling 
themselves by approaching the grave, and placing a watch, has certainly been 
overstrained by the Fragmentist; but their conduct, when the guards, returning 
from the grave, apprised them of the resurrection of Jesus, is truly impossible. 
They believe the assertion of the soldiers that Jesus had arisen out of his 
grave in a miraculous manner. How could the council, many of whose members were 
Sadducees, receive this as credible? Even the Pharisees in the Sanhedrim, though 
they held in theory the possibility </p>
<p>* Olshausen overlooks the latter point when he (ut sup.) says the watch had 
not received the command to prevent the completion of the interment.</p>
<p>† Olshausen indeed is here still so smitten with awe, that he supposes Pilate 
to have been penetrated with an indescribable feeling of dread on hearing this 
communication from the Sanhedrists, s. 505.</p>
<p>807</p>
<p>of a resurrection, would not, with the mean opinion which they entertained.of 
Jesus, be inclined to believe in his resurrection; especially as the assertion 
in the mouth of the guards sounded just like a falsehood invented to screen a 
failure in duty. The real Sanhedrists, on hearing such an assertion from the 
soldiers, would have replied with exasperation: You lie! you have slept and 
allowed him to be stolen; but you will have to pay dearly for this, when it 
comes to be investigated by the procurator. But instead of this, the Sanhedrists 
in our gospel speak them fair, and entreat them thus: Tell a lie, say that you 
have slept and allowed him to be stolen: moreover, they pay them richly for the 
falsehood, and promise to exculpate them to the procurator. This is evidently 
spoken entirely on the Christian presupposition of the reality of the 
resurrection of Jesus; a presupposition however which is quite incorrectly 
attributed to the members of the Sanhedrim. It is also a difficulty, not merely 
searched out by the Fragmentist, but even acknowledged by orthodox expositors,<sup>*
</sup>that the Sanhedrim, in a regular assembly, and after a formal 
consultation, should have resolved to corrupt the soldiers and put a lie into 
their mouths. That in this manner a college of seventy men should have 
officially decided on suggesting and rewarding the utterance of a falsehood, is, 
as Olshausen justly observes, too widely at variance with the decorum, the sense 
of propriety, inseparable from such an assembly. The expedient of supposing that 
it was merely a private meeting, since only the <i>chief priests </i>and <i>
elders, </i>not the <i>scribes, </i>are said to have embraced the resolution of 
bribing the soldiers,<sup>† </sup>would involve the singularity, that in this 
assembly the <i>scribes </i>were absent, while in the shortly previous interview 
with the procurator, where the <i>scribes </i>are represented by the Pharisees 
who formed their majority, the <i>elders </i>were wanting: whence it is evident 
rather that, it being inconvenient invariably to designate the Sanhedrim by a 
full enumeration of its constituent parts, it was not seldom indicated by the 
mention of only some or one of these. If it therefore remains that according to 
Matthew the high council must in a formal session have resolved on bribing the 
guards: such an act of baseness could only be attributed to the council as such, 
by the rancour of the primitive Christians, among whom our anecdote arose.</p>
<p>These difficulties in the present narrative of the first gospel have been 
felt to be so pressing, that it has been attempted to remove them by the 
suppoposition of interpolation; <sup>‡ </sup>which has lately been moderated 
into the opinion, that while the anecdote did not indeed proceed from the 
Apostle Matthew himself, it was not however added by a hand otherwise alien to 
our gospel, but was inserted by the Greek translator of the Hebrew Matthew.<sup>§
</sup>Against the former </p>

the Charakteristiken u. Kritiken, s. 280.</p>
<p align="center">808</p>
<p>supposition the absence of all critical authority is decisive; the appeal of 
those who advance the other opinion to the unapostolic character of the 
anecdote, would not warrant its separation from the context of the main 
narrative, unless that narrative itself were already proved to be of apostolic 
origin; while the anecdote is so far from presenting any want of connexion with 
the rest, that, on the contrary, Paulus is right in his remark that an 
interpolator (or inserting translator) would scarcely have given himself the 
trouble to distribute his interpolation in three different places (xxvii. 62—66; 
xxviii. 4, 11<i>—</i>15)<i>, </i>but would have compressed it into one passage, 
or at most two. Neither can the question be settled so cheaply as Olshausen 
imagines, when he concludes that the entire narrative is apostolic and correct, 
save that the Evangelist erred in representing the corruption of the guards as 
being resolved on in full council, whereas the affair was probably managed in 
secret by Caiaphas alone: as if this assembly of the council were the sole 
difficulty of the narrative, and as if, when errors had insinuated themselves in 
relation to this particular, they might not extend to others also.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>Paulus correctly points out how Matthew himself, by the statement: <i>and 
this saying is commonly reported among the Jews to this day</i>,—indicates a 
calumnious Jewish report as the source of his narrative. But when this 
theologian expresses the opinion that the Jews themselves propagated the story, 
that they had placed a watch at the grave of Jesus, but that the guards had 
permitted his body to be stolen: this is as perverted a view as that of Hase, 
when he conjectures that the report in question proceeded first of all from the 
friends of Jesus, and was afterwards modified by his enemies. For as regards the 
former supposition, Kuinöl has already correctly remarked, that Matthew merely 
designates the assertion respecting the theft of the corpse as a Jewish report, 
not the entire narrative of the placing of a watch; neither is there any reason 
to be conceived why the Jews should have fabricated such a report as that a 
watch was set at the grave of Jesus: Paulus says, it was hoped thereby to render 
the assertion that the body of Jesus was stolen by his disciples more easy of 
acceptation with the credulous: but those must indeed have been very credulous 
who did not observe, that the placing of the watch was the very thing to render 
a furtive removal of the body of Jesus improbable. Paulus appears to represent 
the matter to himself thus: the Jews wished to obtain witnesses as it were to 
the accusation of a theft, and for this purpose fabricated the story of the 
guard being placed by the grave. But that the guards with open eyes quietly 
beheld. the disciples of Jesus carry away his body, no one could credit: while, 
if they saw nothing of this, because they slept, they gave no testimony, since 
they could then only by inference arrive at the conclusion, that the body might 
have been stolen: a conclusion which could be drawn just as well without them. 
Thus in no way can the watch have belonged to the </p>
<p>* Hase, L. J., § 145.</p>
<p align="center">809</p>
<p>Jewish basis of the present narrative; but the report disseminated among the 
Jews consisted, as the text also says, merely in the assertion that the 
disciples had stolen the body. As the Christians wished to oppose this calumny, 
there was formed among them the legend of a watch placed at the grave of Jesus, 
and now they could boldly confront their slanderers with the question: how can 
the body have been carried away, since you placed a watch at the grave and 
sealed the stone? And because, as we have ourselves proved in the course of our 
inquiry, a legend is not fully convicted of groundlessness until it has been 
shown how it could arise even without historical grounds: it was attempted on 
the side of the Christians, in showing what was supposed to be the true state of 
the case, to expose also the origin of the false legend, by deriving the 
falsehood propagated among the Jews from the contrivance of the Sanhedrim, and 
their corruption of the guards. Thus the truth is precisely the reverse of what 
Hase says, namely, that the legend probably arose among the friends of Jesus and 
was modified by his enemies :—the friends first had an inducement to the fiction 
of the watch, when the enemies had already spoken of a theft.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>§ 137. FIRST TIDINGS OF THE RESURRECTION.</p>
<p>That the first news of the grave of Jesus being opened and empty on the 
second morning after his burial, came to the disciples by the mouth of women, is 
unanimously stated by the four Evangelists: but in all the more particular 
circumstances they diverge from each other, in a way which has presented the 
richest material for the polemic of the Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist, and on the 
other hand has given abundant work to the harmonists and apologists, without 
there having been hitherto any successful attempt at a satisfactory mediation 
between the two parties.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>Leaving behind the difference which is connected with the divergencies in the 
history of the burial, as to the object of the women in resorting to the 
grave,—namely, that according to the two intermediate Evangelists they intended 
to embalm the body of Jesus, according to the two others merely to pay a visit 
to the grave,—we find, first, a very complicated divergency relative to the 
number of the women who made this visit. Luke merely speaks indefinitely of many 
women; not alone those whom he describes xxiii. 55, as having come with Jesus 
from Galilee, and of whom he mentions by name, Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary 
the mother of James, but also <i>certain others with them </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">tineV sun</font> <font FACE="Symbol">autaiV</font><i> </i>
(xxiv. 1). Mark has merely three women; two of those whom Luke also names, but 
as the third, Salome instead of Joanna (xvi. 1). Matthew has not this third 
woman, respecting whom the two intermediate Evangelists </p>
<p>* Comp. Theile, zur Biogr. Jesu, § 37; Weisse, die Evang. Gesch. 2, s. 343 f.</p>
<p>† Comp. Theile, ut sup.</p>
<p align="center">810</p>
<p>differ, but merely the two Maries concerning whom they agree (xxviii. 1). 
Lastly, John has only one of these, Mary Magdalene (xx. 1). The time at which 
the women go to the grave is likewise not determined with uniformity; for even 
if the words of Matthew, <i>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn 
toward the first day of the week, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oye sabbatown</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">th epifwskoush eiV mian sabbatwn</font><i>, </i>make no 
difference,<sup>* </sup>still the addition of Mark : <i>at the rising of/he sun,
</i><font FACE="Symbol">anateilantoV tou</font> <font FACE="Symbol">hliou</font><i>,
</i>are in contradiction with the expressions <i>when it was yet dark, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">skotiaV eti oushV</font><i>, </i>in John, and <i>very early 
in the morning, </i><font FACE="Symbol">orqroubaqeiV</font><i>, </i>in Luke.—In 
relation to the circumstances in which the women first saw the grave there may 
appear to be a difference, at least between Matthew and the three other 
Evangelists. According to the latter, as they approach and look towards the 
grave, they see that the stone has already been rolled away by an unknown hand: 
whereas the narrative of the first Evangelist has appeared to many to imply that 
the women themselves beheld the stone rolled away by an angel.—Manifold are the 
divergencies as to what the women further saw and learned at the grave, 
According to Luke they enter into the grave, find that the body of Jesus is not 
there, and are hence in perplexity, until they see standing, by them two men in 
shining garments, who announce to them his resurrection. In Mark, who also makes 
them enter into the grave, they see only one young man in a long white garment, 
not standing, but sitting on the right side, who gives them the same 
intelligence. In Matthew they receive this information before they enter into 
the grave, from the angel, who after rolling away the stone had sat upon it. 
Lastly, according to John, Mary Magdalene, as soon as she sees the stone taken 
away, and without witnessing any angelic appearance, runs back into the 
city.—Moreover the relation in which the disciples of Jesus are placed with 
respect to the first news of his resurrection is a different one in the 
different gospels. According to Mark, the women, out of fear, tell no one of the 
angelic appearance which they have beheld; according to John, Mary Magdalene has 
nothing more to say to John and Peter, to whom she hastens from the grave, than 
that Jesus is taken away; according to Luke, the women report the appearance to 
the disciples in general, and not merely to two of them; while according to 
Matthew, as they were in the act of hastening to the disciples, Jesus himself 
met them, and they were able to communicate this also to the disciples. In the 
two first gospels nothing is said of one of the disciples himself going to the 
grave on hearing the report of the women; according to Luke, Peter went thither, 
found it empty and returned wondering, and from Luke xxiv. 24 it appears that 
other disciples besides him went thither in a similar manner; according to the 
fourth gospel Peter was accompanied by John, who on this occasion was convinced 
of the resurrection of Jesus. Luke says that Peter made his visit to the 
sepulchre after he had already been </p>
<p>* Comp. Fritzsche, in loc., and Kern, Tüb. Zeitschr. 1834, 2, s. 102 f.</p>
<p align="center">811</p>
<p>informed by the women of the angelic appearance; but in the fourth gospel the 
two disciples go to the grave before Mary Magdalene can have told them of such 
an appearance; it was only when she had proceeded a second time to the grave 
with the two disciples, and when they had returned home again, that, stooping 
into the sepulchre, she saw, according to this gospel, <i>two angels in white, 
sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body ofJesus 
had lain, </i>by whom she was asked, why she wept? and on turning round she 
beheld Jesus himself; a particular of which there is a fragmentary notice in 
Mark v. 9, with the additional remark, that she communicated this news to his 
former companions.</p>
<p>It has been thought possible to reconcile the greater part of these 
divergencies by supposing, instead of one scene variously described, a 
multiplicity of different scenes; for which purpose the ordinary grammatical and 
other artifices of the harmonists were pressed into the service. That Mark might 
not contradict the <font FACE="Symbol">skotiaV eti oushV </font><i>while it was 
yet dark </i>of John, the apologists did not scruple to translate the words
<font FACE="Symbol">anateilantoV tou</font> <font FACE="Symbol">hliou </font>by
<i>orituro sole; </i>the contradiction between Matthew and the rest, when the 
former appears to say that the women saw the stone rolled away by the angel, 
seemed to be more easy of solution, not indeed by supposing, with Michaelis,<sup>*
</sup>that , <font FACE="Symbol">kai idou</font> <i>(and behold!) </i>denotes a 
recurrence to a previous event, and that <font FACE="Symbol">apekulise </font>
has the signification of a pluperfect (an expedient which has been justly 
combated by modern criticism in opposition to Lessing, who was inclined to admit 
it) ; <sup>† </sup>but by understanding the <font FACE="Symbol">hlqe </font>v. 1 
to express a yet unfinished progress of the women towards the grave, in which 
case the <font FACE="Symbol">kai idou </font>and what follows may, in accordance 
with its proper meaning, relate something that happened after the departure of 
the women from their home, but before their arrival at the grave.<sup>‡ </sup>In 
relation to the number and the visit of the women, it was in the first place 
urged that even according to John, although he mentions only Mary Magdalene by 
name,—several women must have accompanied her to the grave, since he makes her 
say after her return to the two disciples: <i>we know not where they have laid 
him ; </i><sup>§ </sup>a plural, which certainly intimates the presence of other 
but unspecified persons, with whom Mary Magdalene, whether at the grave itself 
or on her return, had conversed on the subject before she came to the Apostles. 
Thus, it is said, Mary Magdalene went to the grave with the other women, more or 
fewer of whom are mentioned by the other Evangelists. As however she returned 
without having, like the other women, seen an angel, it is supposed that she ran 
back alone as soon as she saw the stone rolled away: which is accounted for by 
her impetuous temperament, she having been formerly a demoniac.<sup>|| </sup>

<p>hastened back to the city, the other women saw the appearances of which the 
synoptists speak.—To all it is maintained, the angels appeared within the grave; 
for the statement in Matthew that one sat outside on the stone, is only a 
pluperfect: when the women came he had already withdrawn into the sepulchre, and 
accordingly, after their conversation with him, the women are described as <i>
departing from the sepulchre, </i><font FACE="Symbol">exelqousai ek tou mnhmeiou<i>
</i></font>(v. 8): <sup>* </sup>in which observation it is only overlooked that 
between the first address of the angel and the above expression, there stands 
his invitation to the women to come with him into the grave and see the place 
where Jesus had lain. In relation to the difference that according to the two 
first Evangelists the women see only one angel, according to the third, two, 
even Calvin resorts to the miserable expedient of supposing a synecdoche, namely 
that all the Evangelists certainly knew of two angels, but Matthew and Mark 
mention only the one who acted as speaker. Others make different women see 
different appearances: some, of whom Matthew and Mark speak, seeing only one 
angel; the others, to whom Luke refers, and who came earlier or perhaps later 
than the above, seeing two <sup>† </sup>but Luke makes the same two Maries who, 
according to his predecessors, had seen only one angel, narrate to the Apostles 
an appearance of two angels. It is also said that the women returned in separate 
groups, so that Jesus might meet those of whom Matthew speaks without being seen 
by those of Luke; and though those of Mark at first tell no one from fear, the 
rest, and they themselves afterwards, might communicate what they had seen to 
the disciples. <sup>‡ </sup>—On hearing the report brought by several women, 
Peter, according to Luke, straightway goes to the grave, finds it empty and 
turns away wondering. But according to the hypothesis which we are now 
detailing, Mary Magdalene had run back a considerable time before the other 
women, and had brought with her to the grave Peter and John. Thus Peter, first 
on hearing the imperfect intelligence of Mary Magdalene that the grave was 
empty, must have gone thither with John; and subsequently, on the account of the 
angelic appearance brought by the other women, he must have gone a second time 
alone: in which case it would be particularly surprising that while his 
companion arrived at a belief in the resurrection of Jesus on the very first 
visit, he himself had not attained further than wonder even on the second. 
Besides, as the Fragmentist has already ably shown, the narrative in the third 
gospel of the visit of Peter alone, and that in the fourth of the visit of Peter 
and John, are so strikingly similar even in words,<sup>§ </sup>that the majority 
of commentators regard them as referring </p>

<p>to a single visit, Luke having only omitted to notice the companion of Peter: 
in support of which opinion they can appeal to Luke xxiv. 24. But if the visit 
of the two Apostles, occasioned by the return of Mary Magdalene, be one and the 
same with that occasioned by the return of the other women, then the return of 
the women is also not a double one; if however they returned in company with 
each other, we have a contradiction. After the two Apostles are returned without 
having seen an angel, Mary, who remains behind, as she looks into the grave, all 
at once sees two. What a strange playing at hide and seek must there have been 
on the part of the angels, according to the harmonistic combination of these 
narratives! First only one shows himself to one group of women, to another group 
two show themselves; both forthwith conceal themselves from the disciples; but 
after their departure both again become visible. To remove these intermissions 
Paulus has placed the appearance presented to Mary Magdalene before the arrival 
of the two disciples: but by this violent transposition of the order chosen by 
the narrator, he has only confessed the impossibility of thus incorporating the 
various Evangelists with each other. Hereupon, as Mary Magdalene raises herself 
from looking into the grave and turns round, she sees Jesus standing behind her. 
According to Matthew, Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, when 
they had already set out on their way to the city, consequently when they were 
at some distance from the grave. Thus Jesus would have first appeared to Mary 
Magdalene alone, close to the grave, and a second time when she was on her way 
from thence, in the company of another woman. In order to avoid the want of 
purpose attaching to the repetition of an appearance of Jesus after so short an 
interval, commentators have here called in the above supposition, that Mary 
Magdalene had previously separated herself from the women of whom Matthew speaks 
: <sup>* </sup>but in that case,, since Matthew has besides Mary Magdalene only 
the other Mary, it would have been only one woman to whom Jesus appeared on the 
way from the grave: whereas Matthew throughout speaks of several
<font FACE="Symbol">(aphnthsen autaiV).</p>
</font>
<p>To escape from this restless running to and fro of the disciples and the 
women, this phantasmagoric appearance, disappearance, and reappearance of the 
angels, and the useless repetition of the appearances of Jesus before the same 
person, which result from this harmonistic method, we must consider each 
Evangelist by himself: we then obtain from each a quiet picture with simple 
dignified features; one visit of the women to the grave, or according to John, 
two; one </p>
<p>* Kuinöl, in Matth., p. 800 f.</p>
<p align="center">814</p>
<p>angelic appearance; one appearance of Jesus, according toJohn and Matthew; 
and one visit to the grave by one or two of the disciples, according to Luke and 
John.</p>
<p>But with the above difficulties of the harmonistic method of incorporation as 
to the substance, there is associated a difficulty as to form, in the question,. 
how comes it, under the presuppositions of this mode of viewing the gospels, 
that from the entire series of occurrences, each narrator has selected a 
separate portion for himself,—that of the many visits and appearances not one 
Evangelist relates all, and scarcely one the same as his neighbour, but for the 
most part each has chosen only one for representation, and each again a 
different one? The most plausible answer to this question has been given by 
Griesbach in a special treatise on this subject.<sup>* </sup>He supposes that 
each Evangelist recounts the resurrection of Jesus in the manner in which it 
first,. became known to him: John received the first information from Mary 
Magdalene, and hence he narrates only what he learned from her; to Matthew (for 
without doubt the disciples, as strangers visiting the feast, resided in 
different quarters of the city), the first news was communicated by those women 
to whom Jesus himself appeared on their way from the grave, and hence he relates 
only what these had experienced. But here this explanation already founders on 
the facts, that in Matthew, of the women who see Jesus on their way homeward, 
Mary Magdalene is one; and that in John, Mary Magdalene, after her second visit 
to the grave, in which Jesus. appeared to her, no longer went to John and Peter 
alone, but to the disciples in general, and communicated to them the appearance 
she had seen and the commission she had received: so that Matthew in any case 
must also have known of the appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene.<sup>† </sup>
Further, when, according to this hypothesis, Mark narrates the history of the 
resurrection as. he had learned it in the house of his mother who lived in 
Jerusalem (Acts xii. 12); Luke, as he had received it from Joanna, whom he alone 
mentions: we cannot but wonder at the tenacity with which, according to this, 
each must have clung to the narrative which he had happened first to receive, 
since the resurrection of Jesus must have been the subject of all others on 
which there was the most lively interchange of narratives among his adherents, 
so that the ideas concerning the first tidings of the event must have found 
their level. To remove these difficulties, Griesbach has further supposed, that 
the disciples had it in their intention to compare the discordant accounts of 
the women and reduce them to order; when, however, the resuscitated Jesus 
himself appeared in the midst of them, they neglected this, because they now no 
longer founded their faith on the assertions of the women, but on the 
appearances which they had themselves witnessed: but the more the information of 
the women </p>

<p>† Comp. Schneckenburger, ut sup. s. 64 f., Anm.</p>
<p align="center">815</p>
<p>fell into the background, the less conceivable is it, how in the sequel each 
could so obstinately cling to what this or that woman. had chanced first to 
communicate to him.</p>
<p>If then the plan of incorporation will not lead to the desired end,<sup>*
</sup>we must try that of selection, and inquire whether we must not adhere to 
one of the four accounts, as pre-eminently apostolic, and by this rectify the 
others; in which inquiry here as elsewhere, from the essential equality of the 
external evidence, only the internal character of the separate narratives can 
decide.</p>
<p>From the number of those accounts concerning the first intelligence of the 
resurrection of Jesus which have any claim to the rank of autoptical 
testimonies, modern criticism has excluded that of the first gospel <sup>† </sup>
and we cannot, as in other instances, complain of this disfavour as an 
injustice. For in many respects the narrative of the first gospel here betrays 
itself to have been carried a step farther in traditional development than that 
of the other gospels. First, that the miraculous opening of the grave is seen by 
the women—if indeed Matthew intends to say this—could scarcely, had it really 
been the case, have been so entirely lost from remembrance as it is in the other 
Evangelists, but might very well be formed gradually in tradition; further, that 
the rolling away of the stone was effected by the angel, evidently rests only on 
the combination of one who did not know any better means of answering the 
question, how the great stone was removed from the grave, and the guards taken 
out of the way, than to use for both purposes the angel presented to him in the 
current narratives of the appearance witnessed by the women; to which he added 
the earthquake as a further embellishment of the scene. But besides this, there 
is in the narrative of Matthew yet another trait, which has anything but an 
historical aspect. After the angel has already announced the resurrection of 
Jesus to the women, and charged them to deliver to the disciples the message 
that they should go into Galilee, where they would see the risen one: Jesus 
himself meets them and repeats the message which they are to deliver to the 
disciples. This is a singular superfluity. Jesus had nothing to add to the 
purport of the message which the angel had given to the women; hence he could 
only wish to confirm it and render it more authentic. But to the women it needed 
no further confirmation, for they were already filled with <i>great joy</i> by 
the tidings of the angel, and thus were believing; while for the disciples even 
that confirmation did not suffice, for they remained incredulous even to the 
account of those who assured them that they had seen Jesus, until they had seen 
him themselves. Thus it appears that two different narrations, as to the first 
news of the resurrection, have here become entangled with each other; the one 
representing angels, the other Jesus himself, as the medium by which </p>

ff.</p>
<p align="center">816</p>
<p>the women were informed of the event and sent with a message to the disciples 
:—the latter evidently the later tradition.</p>
<p>The pre-eminence in originality denied to the narrative of Matthew, is here 
as elsewhere awarded to that of John. Traits so characteristic, says Lücke, as 
that on the visit to the grave the <i>other disciple </i>went faster than Peter 
and came to the spot before him, attest the authenticity of the gospel even to 
the most sceptical. But the matter has yet another aspect. It has been already 
remarked, at an earlier point of our inquiry, that this particular belongs to 
the effort, which the fourth gospel exhibits in a peculiar manner, to place John 
above Peter.<sup>* </sup>We may now discuss the point with more particularity, 
by comparing the account in Luke already mentioned of the visit of Peter to the 
grave, with the account in the fourth gospel of the visit of the two disciples. 
According to Luke (xxiv. 12), Peter runs to the grave: according to John (xx. 3 
ff.), Peter and the favourite disciple go together, but so that the latter runs 
faster, and comes first to the grave. In the third gospel, Peter stoops down, 
looks into the sepulchre, and sees the linen clothes: in the fourth, John does 
this, and sees the same. In the third gospel, nothing is said of an entering 
into the grave: but the fourth makes Peter enter first, and look more closely at 
the linen clothes, then John also, and the latter with the result that he begins 
to believe in the resurrection of Jesus.<sup>† </sup>That in these two 
narratives we have one and the same incident, has been above shown probable from 
their similarity even in the expressions. Thus the only question is: which is 
the original narrative, the one nearest to the fact? If that of John: then must 
his name have been gradually lost out of the narrative in the course of 
tradition, and the visit to the grave ascribed to Peter only; which, since the 
importance of Peter threw all others into the shade, is easily conceivable. We 
might rest contented with this conclusion, regarding these two parallel 
narratives by themselves: but in connexion with the whole suspicious position 
which the fourth gospel assigns to John in relation to Peter, the contrary 
relation of the two narratives must here again be held the more probable. As in 
the entrance into the high priest’s palace, so in the visit to the grave of 
Jesus, only in the fourth gospel is John given as a companion to Peter; as in 
the former case it is he who gains an entrance for Peter, so in the latter he 
runs before him and casts the first glance into the grave, a circumstance which 
is repeatedly mentioned. That afterwards Peter is the first to enter into the 
grave, is only an apparent advantage, which is allowed him out of deference to 
the common idea of his position: for after him John also enters, and with a 
result of which Peter could not boast, namely, that he believed in the 
resurrection of Jesus, and thus was the first who attained to that degree of 
faith. From this<sub> </sub>effort to make John </p>

<p align="center">817</p>
<p>the first-born among the believers in the resurrection of Jesus may also be 
explained the divergency, that according to the narrative of the fourth gospel 
alone, Mary Magdalene hastens back to the two disciples before she has yet seen 
an angel. For had she beforehand witnessed an angelic appearance, which she 
would not any more than the women in Matthew have mistrusted, she would have 
been the first believer, and would have won the precedence of John in this 
respect; but this is avoided by representing her as coming to the two disciples 
immediately after perceiving the emptiness of the grave, and under the 
disquietude excited in her by this circumstance. This presupposition serves also 
to explain why the fourth gospel makes the woman returning from the grave go, 
not to the disciples in general, but only to Peter and John. As, namely, the 
intelligence which, according to the original narrative, was brought to all the 
disciples, occasioned, according to Luke, only Peter to go to the grave, and as 
moreover, according to Mark (v. 7), the message of the women was destined more 
especially for Peter: the idea might easily be formed, that the news came to 
this disciple alone, with whom the object of the fourth Evangelist would then 
require that he should associate John. Only after the two disciples had come to 
the grave, and his John had attained faith, could the author of the fourth 
gospel introduce the appearances of the angel and of Jesus himself, which were 
said to have been granted to the women. That instead of these collectively he 
names only Mary Magdalene—although as has been earlier remarked, he xx. 2 
presupposes at least a subsequent meeting between her and other women—this might 
certainly, under other circumstances, be regarded as the original 
representation, whence the synoptical one arose by a process of generalization: 
but it might just as well be the case that the other women, being less known, 
were eclipsed by Mary Magdalene. The description of the scene between her and 
Jesus, with the non-recognition of him at the first moment, etc., certainly does 
honour to the ingenuity and pathos of the author <sup>* </sup>but here also 
there is an unhistorical superfluity similar to that in Matthew. For here the 
angels have not, as in the other Evangelists, to announce the resurrection to 
Mary Magdalene, and to make a disclosure to her; but they merely ask her, <i>Why 
weepest thou? </i>whereupon she complains to them of the disappearance of the 
body of Jesus, but, without waiting for any further explanation, turns round and 
sees Jesus standing. Thus as in Matthew the appearance of Jesus, since it is not 
represented as the principal and effective one, is a superfluous addition to</p>
<p>that of the angel: so here the angelic appearance is an idle, ostentatious 
introduction to the appearance of Jesus.</p>
<p>If we turn to the third account, that of Mark, to ascertain whether he may 
not perhaps be the nearest to the fact: we find it so incoherent, and composed 
of materials so little capable of being fitted together, that such a relation is 
not to be thought of. After it has </p>
<p>* Weisse is of a different opinion, ut sup. s. 355<i>, </i>Anm.</p>
<p align="center">818</p>
<p>been already narrated that early in the morning of the day succeeding the 
Sabbath the women came to the grave of Jesus, and were informed by an angel of 
his resurrection, but out of fear said nothing to any one of the appearance 
which they had seen (xvi. 1-8) : at v. 9, as if nothing had previously been said 
either of the resurrection or of the time at which it happened, the narrator 
proceeds: <i>Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he 
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils,</i>
<font FACE="Symbol">anastaV de prwi prwth sabbatwn efanh</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">prwton Maria th Magdalhnh</font>. This statement also does 
not suit the foregoing narrative, because this is not formed on the supposition 
of an appearance specially intended for Mary Magdalene: on the contrary, as she 
is said to be informed by an angel of the resurrection of Jesus, together with 
two other women, Jesus could not have appeared to her beforehand; while 
afterwards, on her way to the city, she was in company with the other women, 
when, according to Matthew, they were all actually met by Jesus. Whether on this 
account we are to regard the end of the gospel of Mark, from v. 9, as a later 
addition,<sup>* </sup>is indeed doubtful, from the want of decisive critical 
grounds, and still more from the abruptness of the conclusion
<font FACE="Symbol">efobounto gar</font><i>, for they were afraid, </i>which the 
gospel would then present: but in any case we have here a narrative which the 
author, without any clear idea of the state of the fact and the succession of 
the events, hastily compiled out of the heterogeneous elements of the current 
legend, which he knew not how to manage.</p>
<p>In the narrative of Luke there would be no special difficulty: but it has a 
suspicious element in common with the others, namely, the angelic appearance, 
and moreover, in a twofold form. What had the angels to do in this scene? 
Matthew tells us: to roll away the stone from the grave; on which it has already 
been remarked by Celsus, that according to the orthodox presupposition, the Son 
of God could find no such aid necessary for this purpose: <sup>† </sup>he might 
indeed find it suitable and becoming. In Mark and Luke the angels appear more as 
having to impart information and commissions to the women: but as, according to 
Matthew and John, Jesus himself appeared immediately after, and repeated those 
commissions, the delivery of them by angels was superfluous. Hence, nothing 
remains but to say: the angels belonged to the embellishment of the great scene, 
as celestial attendants who had to open the Messiah the door by which he meant 
to issue forth; as a guard of honour on the spot from which the once dead had 
just departed with recovered life. But here occurs the question : does this 
species of pomp exist in the real court of God, or only in the childish 
conception formed of it by antiquity?</p>
<p>* As Paulus, Fritzsche, Credner, Einleitung, 1, § 49. Comp. De Wette, exeg. 
Handb. 1, 2, s. 199 f. A middle view in Hug, Einl. in d. N. T. 2,<i> </i>§ 69.</p>
<p>† Orig c. Cels. v. 52.</p>
<p align="center">819</p>
<p>Hence commentators have laboured in various ways to transform the angels in 
the history of the resurrection into natural appearances. Setting out from the 
account of the first gospel in which the angel is said to have <i>a form </i>or
<i>countenance like lightning </i><font FACE="Symbol">idea wV astraph</font><i>,
</i>and to effect the rolling away of the stone and the prostration of the 
guards, while an earthquake is connected with his appearance: it no longer lay 
far out of the way to think of a flash of lightning, which struck the stone with 
force sufficient to shatter it, and cast the guards to the earth; or of an 
earthquake which, accompanied by flames bursting out of the ground, produced the 
same effect; in which case the flames and the overwhelming force of the 
phenomenon were taken by the watching soldiers for an angel.<sup>* </sup>But 
partly the circumstance that the angel seated himself on the stone after it had 
been rolled away, partly, and still more decidedly, the statement that he spoke 
to the women, renders this hypothesis insufficient. Hence an effort has been 
made to complete it by the supposition that the sublime thought, Jesus is risen! 
which on the discovery that the grave was empty began to arise in the women and 
gradually to subdue their first doubts, was ascribed by them, after the oriental 
mode of thought and language, to an angel.<sup>† </sup>But how comes it that in 
all the gospels the angels are represented as clothed in white, shining 
garments? Is that too an oriental figure of speech? The oriental may indeed 
describe a good thought which occurs to him as being whispered to him by an 
angel: but to depict the clothing and aspect of this angel, passes the bounds of 
the merely figurative even among orientals. In the description of the first 
gospel the supposed lightning might be called to aid in the conjecture that the 
effect thereby produced on the senses of the women was ascribed by them to an 
angel, which, with reference to that lightning, they depicted as one clothed in 
shining garments. But, according to the other Evangelists, the rolling away of 
the stone, <i>ex hypothesi </i>by the lightning, was not seen by the women; on 
the contrary, when they went or looked into the grave, the white forms appeared 
to them in a perfectly tranquil position. According to this, it must have been 
something within the grave which suggested to them the idea of white-robed 
angels. Now in the grave, according to Luke and John, there lay the white linen 
clothes in which the body of Jesus had been wrapt: these, which were recognized 
simply as such by the more composed and courageous men, might, it is said, by 
timid and excited women, in the dark grave and by the deceptive morning 
twilight, be easily mistaken for angels.<sup>‡ </sup>But how should the women, 
who must have expected to find in the grave a corpse enveloped in white, be 
prompted by the sight of these clothes to a thought so strange, </p>

<p align="center">820</p>
<p>and which then lay so remote from their anticipations, as that they might be 
an angel who would announce to them the resurrection of their deceased master? 
It has been thought in another quarter quite superfluous here to advance so many 
ingenious conjectures as to what the angels may have been, since, among the four 
narratives, two expressly tell us what they were: namely, natural men, Mark 
calling his angel a <i>young man, </i><font FACE="Symbol">neaniskon</font><i>,
</i>Luke his two angels, <i>two men, </i><font FACE="Symbol">andraV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">duo</font><i>.</i><sup>* </sup>Whom then are we to suppose 
these men to have been? Here again the door is opened for the supposition of 
secret colleagues of Jesus, who must have been unknown even to the two disciples 
:—these men seen at the grave may have been the same who met him in the 
so-called Transfiguration, perhaps Essenes, white being worn by this sect,—or 
whatever else of the like conjectures the antiquated pragmatism of a Bahrdt or 
Venturini has to offer. Or will it rather be chosen to suppose a purely 
accidental meeting? or, lastly, with Paulus, to leave the matter in an 
obscurity, from the midst of which, so soon as it is endeavoured to clear it up 
by definite thoughts, the two forms of the secret colleagues invariably present 
themselves? A correct discernment will here also rather recognize the forms of 
the Jewish popular conception, by which the primitive Christian tradition held 
it necessary to glorify the resurrection of its Messiah: a recognition, which at 
once solves in the most simple manner the differences in the number and modes of 
appearance of those celestial beings.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>Herewith, however, it is at the same time acknowledged that we can succeed no 
better with the plan of selection than with that of incorporation; but must 
rather confess, that in all the evangelical accounts of these first tidings of 
the resurrection, we have before us nothing more than traditional reports.<sup>‡

<p>§ 138. APPEARANCES OF THE RISEN JESUS IN GALILEE AND IN JUDEA, INCLUDING 
THOSE MENTIONED BY PAUL AND BY APOCRYPHAL WRITINGS.</p>
<p>The most important of all the differences in the history of the resurrection 
turns upon the question, what locality did Jesus design to be the chief theatre 
of his appearances after the resurrection? The two first gospels make Jesus, 
before his death, when retiring to the Mount of Olives, utter this promise to 
his disciples: <i>After I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee </i>
(Matt. xxvi. <i>32; </i>Mark xiv. 28); the same assurance is given to the women

<p align="center">821</p>
<p>by the angels on the morning of the resurrection, with the addition: <i>there 
shall ye see him </i>(Matt. xxviii. 7 ; Mark xvi. 7); and in Matthew, besides 
all this, Jesus in his own person commissions the women to say to the disciples:
<i>that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me </i>(xxviii. 10). In 
Matthew the journey of the disciples into Galilee, with the appearance of Jesus 
which they there witnessed (the only one to the disciples recorded by this 
Evangelist), is actually narrated in the sequel. Mark, after describing the 
amazement into which the women were thrown by the angelic appearance, breaks off 
in the enigmatical manner already mentioned, and appends some appearances of 
Jesus, which,—as the first happens immediately after the resurrection, and 
therefore necessarily in Jerusalem, and no change of place is mentioned before 
the succeeding ones, while the earlier direction to go into Galilee is lost 
sight of,—must all be regarded as appearances in and around Jerusalem. John 
knows nothing of a direction to the disciples to go into Galilee, and makes 
Jesus show himself to the disciples on the evening of the day of resurrection, 
and again eight days after, in Jerusalem; the concluding chapter, however, which 
forms an appendix to his gospel, describes an appearance by the Sea of Galilee. 
In Luke, on the other hand, not only is there no trace of an appearance in 
Galilee, Jerusalem with its environs being made the sole theatre of the 
appearances of Christ which this gospel relates; but there is also put into the 
mouth of Jesus when, on the evening after the resurrection, he appears to the 
assembled disciples in Jerusalem, the injunction: <i>tarry ye in the city of 
Jerusalem </i>(in the Acts i. 4, more definitely expressed by the negative, <i>
that they should not depart from Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from 
on high </i>(xxiv. 49). Here two questions inevitably arise: 1st, how can Jesus 
have directed the disciples to journey into Galilee, and yet at the same time 
have commanded them to remain in Jerusalem until Pentecost? and 2ndly, how could 
he refer them to a promised appearance in Galilee, when he had the intention of 
showing himself to them that very day in and near Jerusalem?</p>
<p>The first contradiction which presents itself more immediately between 
Matthew and Luke, has by no one been more pointedly exhibited than by the 
Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist. If, he writes, it be true, as Luke says, that Jesus 
appeared to his disciples in Jerusalem on the day of his resurrection, and 
commanded them to remain there, and not to depart thence until Pentecost: then 
is it false that he commanded them within the same period to journey into 
Galilee, that he might appear to them there, and vice versa.<sup>* </sup>The 
harmonists indeed affected to regard this objection as unimportant, and only 
remarked briefly, that the injunction to remain in a city was not equivalent to 
an arrest, and did not exclude walks and excursions in the neighbourhood; and 
that Jesus merely forbade </p>
<p>* In Lessing’s Beitragen, ut sup. s. 485<i>.</p>
</i>
<p align="center">822</p>
<p>the removal of residence from Jerusalem, and the going out into all the world 
to preach the gospel, before the given term should arrive.<sup>* </sup>But the 
journey from Jerusalem to Galilee is not a mere walk, but the longest expedition 
which the Jew could make within the limits of his own country; as little was it 
an excursion for the apostles, but rather a return to their home: while what 
Jesus intended to prohibit to the disciples in that injunction cannot have been 
the going out into all the world to preach the gospel, since they would have no 
impulse to do this before the outpouring of the Spirit; nor can it have been the 
removal of residence from Jerusalem, since they were there only as strangers 
visiting at the feast: rather Jesus must have meant to deter them from that very 
journey which it was the most natural for them to take, i.e. from the return to 
their native province Galilee, after the expiration of the feast days. Besides 
this—and even Michaelis confesses himself obliged to wonder here—if Luke does 
not mean by that prohibition of Jesus to exclude the journey into Galilee, why 
is it that he alludes to this by no single word? and in like manner, if Matthew 
knew that his direction to go into Galilee was consistent with the command to 
remain in the metropolis, why has he omitted the latter, together with the 
appearances in Jerusalem? This is certainly a plain proof that the accounts of 
the two Evangelists are based on a different idea as to the theatre on which the 
risen Jesus appeared.</p>
<p>In this exigency of having to reconcile two contradictory commands given on 
the same day, the comparison with the Acts presented a welcome help by 
indicating a distinction of the times. Here, namely, the command of Jesus that 
the disciples should not leave Jerusalem is placed in his last appearance, forty 
days after the resurrection, and immediately before the ascension: at the close 
of the gospel of Luke it is likewise in the last interview, terminating in the 
ascension, that the above command is given. Now though from the summary 
representation of the gospel taken by itself, it must be believed that all 
occurred on the very day of the resurrection : we nevertheless see, it is said, 
from the history of the Acts by the same author, that between v. 43 and 44 in 
the last chapter of his gospel we must interpose the forty days from the 
resurrection to the ascension. Herewith, then, the apparent contradiction 
between these two commands vanishes: for one who in the first instance indeed 
enjoins a journey into Galilee, may very well forty days later, after this 
journey has been made, and the parties are once more in the metropolis, now 
forbid any further removal from thence.<sup>† </sup>But as the dread of 
admitting a contradiction between different New Testament authors is no ground 
for departing from the natural interpretation of their expressions: so neither 
can this be justified by the apprehension that the same author may in different 
writings contradict himself; since if the one were written somewhat later than 
the other, </p>
<p>* Michaelis, s. 259 f. ; Kuinöl, in Luc., p. 743.</p>
<p>† Schleiermacher, über den Lukas, s. 299 f. ; Paulus, s. 910.</p>
<p align="center">823</p>
<p>the author may in the interim have been on many points otherwise informed, 
than when he composed his first work. That this was actually the case with Luke 
in relation to that part of the life of Jesus which followed his resurrection, 
we shall have reason to be convinced when we come to the history of the 
ascension: and this conclusion removes all ground for interposing nearly five 
weeks between the <font FACE="Symbol">efagen</font><i>, </i>v. 43, and
<font FACE="Symbol">eipe de</font>, v. 44, in defiance of their obviously 
immediate connexion ; at the same time, however, it does away with the 
possibility of reconciling the opposite commands of Jesus in Matthew and Luke by 
a distinction of times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even admitting that this contradiction might be in some way or 
other removed, still, even without that express command which Luke mentions, the 
mere facts as narrated by him and his predecessor and successor, remain 
irreconcilable with the injunction which Jesus gives to the disciples in 
Matthew. For, asks the Fragmentist, if the disciples collectively twice saw him, 
spoke with him, touched him, and ate with him, in Jerusalem; how can it be that 
they must have had to take the long journey into Galilee in order to see him ?
<sup>* </sup>The harmonists, it is true, boldly reply: when Jesus causes his 
disciples to be told that they will see him in Galilee, it is by no means said 
that they will see him nowhere else, still less that they will not see him in 
Jerusalem.<sup>† </sup>But, the Fragmentist might rejoin, after his manner: as 
littIe as one who says to me, go to Rome, there you shall see the Pope, can mean 
that the Pope will indeed first come through my present place of residence, so 
as to be seen by me here, but afterwards I must yet go to Rome, in order to see 
him again there: so little would the angel in Matthew and Mark, if he had had 
any anticipation of the appearance in Jerusalem on the very same day, have said 
to the disciples: go into Galilee, there will Jesus show himself to you; but 
rather: be comforted, you shall yet see him here in Jerusalem before evening. 
Wherefore the reference to the more remote event, when there was one of the same 
kind close at hand? wherefore an appointment by means of the women, for the 
disciples to meet Jesus in Galilee, if the latter foresaw that he should on the 
same day personally speak with the disciples? With reason does the latest 
criticism insist on what Lessing had previqusly urged; <sup>‡ </sup>namely, that 
no rational person would make an appointment with his friends through a third 
party for a joyful reunion at a distant place, if he were certain of seeing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>them repeatedly on the same day in their present locality.<sup>§ </sup>If 
thus the angel and Jesus himself when they in the morning by means of the women 
directed the disciples to go into Galilee, cannot yet have known that he would 
show himself to them on the evening of the same day in and near Jerusalem: he 
must in the morning have still held the intention of going immediately into 
Galilee, but in the </p>

<p>course of the day have embraced another purpose. According to Paulus,<sup>*
</sup>an indication of such an original intention is found in Luke, in the 
travelling of Jesus towards Emmaus, which lay in the direction of Galilee; while 
the reason for the alteration of plan is supposed by the same expositor, with 
whom in this instance Olshausen agrees,<sup>† </sup>to have been the belief of 
the disciples, as more particularly manifested to Jesus on occasion of the 
journey to Emmaus. How so erroneous a calculation on the part of Jesus can 
consist with the orthodox view of his person, is Olshausen’s care; but even 
regarding him in a purely human character, there appears no sufficient reason 
for such a change of mind. Especially after Jesus had been recognised by the two 
disciples going to Emmaus, he might be certain that the testimony of the men 
would so accredit the assertion of the women, as to lead the disciples with at 
least a glimmering ray of faith and hope into Galilee. But in general, if a 
change of mind and a diversity of plan in Jesus before and after that change, 
really existed: why does no one Evangelist take any notice of such a 
retractation? Why does Luke speak as if he knew nothing of the original plan; 
Matthew, as if he knew nothing of a subsequent alteration; John, as if the 
principal theatre of the appearances of the risen Jesus had been Jerusalem, and 
he had only by way of supplement at length showed himself in Galilee? Lastly, 
why does Mark speak so as to make it evident that, having gathered the original 
direction to go into Galilee from Matthew, and the succeeding appearances in 
Jerusalem and its environs from Luke or elsewhere, he was unable, nor did he 
even make the attempt, in any way to reconcile them; but placed them together as 
he found them, rough hewn and contradictory.</p>
<p>According to this we must agree with the latest criticism of the gospel of 
Matthew, in acknowledging the contradiction between it and the rest in relation 
to the locality of the appearances of Jesus after the resurrection : but, it 
must be asked, can we also approve the verdict of this criticism when it at once 
renounces the representation of the first gospel in favour of that of the other 
Evangelists.<sup>‡ </sup>If, setting aside all presuppositions as to the 
apostolic origin of this or that gospel, we put the question: which of the two 
divergent accounts is the best adapted to be regarded as a traditional 
modification and development of the other? we can here refer, not merely to the 
general nature of the accounts, but also to a single point at which the two 
touch each other in a characteristic manner. This is the address of the angel to 
the women, in which according to all the synoptists Galilee is mentioned, but in 
a different way. In Matthew the angel, as has been already noticed, says of 
Jesus: <i>he goeth before you into Galilee,—lo, I have told you </i>(xxviii. 7),
<font FACE="Symbol">proagei umaV eiV thn</font> <font FACE="Symbol">Galilaian</font>—<font FACE="Symbol">idou 
eipon umin</font><i>. </i>In Mark he says the same, </p>
<p>* Exeg. Handb. 3, b. s. 835.</p>
<p>† Bibl. Comm. 2, s. 524.</p>
<p>‡ This is done by Schulz, über das Abendm. s. 321; Schneckenburger, ut sup.</p>
<p align="center">825</p>
<p>except that instead of the latter addition, by which in Matthew the angel 
seeks to impress his own words on the women, he has the expression: <i>as he 
said unto you, </i><font FACE="Symbol">kaqwV eipen umin</font><i>, </i>with 
which he refers to the earlier prediction of Jesus concerning this circumstance. 
If we first compare these two representations:</p>
<p>the confirmatory <i>I have told you, </i><font FACE="Symbol">eipon umin</font>, 
might easily appear superfluous and nugatory; while on the other hand the 
reference to the earlier prediction of Jesus by <i>he said, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">eipen</font>, might seem more appropriate, and on this the 
conjecture might be founded that perhaps Mark has here the correct and original 
phrase, Matthew a variation not unaccompanied by a misunderstanding.<sup>* </sup>
But if we include the account of Luke in the comparison, we find here, as in 
Mark, the words: <i>remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
</i><font FACE="Symbol">mnhsqhte, wV elalhsen umin eti</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">wn en th</font> <font FACE="Symbol">Galilaia</font>, a 
reference to an earlier prediction of Jesus, not however referring to Galilee, 
but delivered in Galilee. Here the question occurs: is it more probable that 
Galilee, from being the designation of the locality in which the prophecy of the 
resurrection was uttered, should at a later period be erroneously converted into 
a designation of the locality where the risen one would appear; or the contrary? 
In order to decide this, we must ascertain in which of the two positions the 
mention of Galilee is the more intrinsically suited to the context. Now that on 
the announcement of the resurrection it was an important point whether and where 
the risen Jesus was to be seen, is self-evident; it was of less moment, in 
referring to an earlier prediction, to specify where this prediction was 
uttered. Hence from this comparison of the passages it might already be held 
more probable that it was originally said, the angels directed the disciples to 
go into Galilee, there to see the risen one (Matt.); but afterwards, when the 
narratives of the appearances of Jesus in Judea had gradually supplanted those 
in Galilee, a different turn was given to the mention of Galilee in the address 
of the angel, so as to make it imply that already in Galilee Jesus had predicted 
his resurrection (Luke); whereupon Mark appears to have taken a middle course, 
since he with Luke refers the <font FACE="Symbol">eipon </font>(changed into
<font FACE="Symbol">eipen</font><i>) </i>to Jesus, but with Matthew retains 
Galilee as the theatre, not of the earlier prediction of Jesus, but of the 
coming appearance.</p>
<p>If we next take into consideration the general character of the two 
narratives and the nature of the case, there exist the same objections to the 
supposition that Jesus after his resurrection appeared several times to his 
disciples in and near Jerusalem, but that the remembrance of this fact was lost, 
and the same arguments in favour of the opposite supposition, as we have 
respectively applied to the analogous alternatives in relation to the various 
journeys to the feasts and Judæan residences of Jesus.<sup>† </sup>That the 
appearances of the risen Jesus in Jerusalem should undesignedly, that is, by a 
total </p>
<p>* On which account Michaelis, s. 118 f., is of opinion that
<font FACE="Symbol">eipen </font>was the original reading in Matthew also. Comp.

<p>obliteration of them from the minds of individuals, have sunk into oblivion 
in Galilee, where according to this presupposition the tradition of Matthew was 
formed, is difficult to conceive, both from the pre-eminent importance of these 
appearances, which, as for example those before the assembled eleven and before 
Thomas, involved the surest attestations of the reality of his resurrection, and 
also from the organizing influence of the community in Jerusalem; while that the 
Judæan appearances ofJesus were indeed known in Galilee, but intentionally 
suppressed by the author of the first gospel, in order to preserve the honour 
for his province alone, would presuppose an exclusivism, an opposition of the 
Galilean Christians to the church at Jerusalem, of which we have not the 
slightest historical trace. The other contrary possibility, that perhaps 
originally only Galilean appearances of the risen Jesus were known, but that 
tradition gradually added appearances in Judea and Jerusalem, and that at length 
these completely supplanted the former, may on many grounds be heightened into a 
probability. First, as respects the time, the tidings of the resurrection of 
Jesus were the more striking, the more immediately his appearances followed on 
his burial and resurrection: if however he first appeared in Galilee, such an 
immediate sequence of the events could not exist ; further, it was a natural 
idea that the resurrection of Jesus must have been attested by appearances in 
the place where he died <i>; </i>lastly, the objection that Jesus after his 
pretended resurrection only appeared to his own friends, and in a corner of 
Galilee, was in some degree repelled when it could be alleged that on the 
contrary, he walked as one arisen from the dead in the metropolis, in the midst 
of his furious enemies, though indeed he was neither to be taken nor seen by 
them. But when once several appearances of Jesus were laid in Judea and 
Jerusalem, the appearances in Galilee lost their importance, and might 
thenceforth either be appended in a subordinate position, as in the fourth 
gospel, or even be entirely overlooked, as in the third. This result, drawn from 
the possible mode of legendary formation, not being opposed, as in the inquiry 
concerning the theatre of the ministry of the living Jesus, by a contrary one 
drawn from the circumstances and designs of Jesus: we may, in contradiction to 
the criticism of the day, decide in favour of the first gospel, whose account of 
the appearance of tlìe risen Jesus recommends itselt as the more simple and free 
from difficulty.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>As regards the appearances of the risen Jesus taken singly, the first gospel 
has two: one on the morning of the resurrection to the women (xxviii. 9 f.), and 
one, the time of which is undetermined, before the disciples in Galilee (xxviii. 
16 f.). Mark, in what is indeed a merely summary statement, enumerates three: 
the first, to </p>
<p>* The opinion that the true locality of the appearances of the risen Jesus 
before the disciples was Galilee, is concurred in by Weisse, 2, s.<i> </i>358 
ff.; but in accordance with his fundamental supposition concerning the 
synoptical gospels, he gives the preference to the narrative of Mark before that 
of Matthew.</p>
<p align="center">827</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene on the morning of the resurrection (xvi. 9 f.); a second, to 
two disciples going into the country (xvi. 12);<i> </i>and a third, to the 
eleven as they sat at meat, doubtless in Jerusalem (xvi. 14). Luke narrates only 
two appearances: that before the disciples going to Emmaus on the day of the 
resurrection (xxiv. 53 ff<i>.</i>), and the last, before the eleven and other 
disciples in Jerusalem, according to xxiv. 36 ff., on the evening of the same 
day, according to the Acts i. 4 ff. forty days later; but when the travellers to 
Emmaus, on rejoining the apostles, are greeted by them, before Jesus has 
appeared in the midst of them, with the information: <i>the Lord is risen 
indeed, and hath appeared to Simon </i>(xxiv. 34): here a third appearance is 
presupposed, which was granted to Peter alone. John has four such appearances: 
the first, to Mary Magdelene at the grave (xx. 14 ff.<i>); </i>the second to the 
disciples when the doors were shut (xx. 19 ff.)<i> </i>; the third, likewise in 
Jerusalem, eight days later, when Thomas was convinced (xx. 26 ff.);<i> </i>the 
fourth, of which the time is unspecified, at the Galilean sea (xxi.). But here 
we have also to take into consideration a statement of the Apostle Paul, who 1 
Cor. xv. 5 ff.<i>, </i>if we deduct the appearance of Christ granted to himself, 
enumerates five appearances after the resurrection, without however giving any 
precise description of them: one to Cephas; one to the twelve ; one before more 
than five hundred brethren at once; one to James; and lastly, one before all the 
apostles.</p>
<p>Now how shall we make an orderly arrangement of these various appearances? 
The right of priority is, in John, and still more expressly in Mark, claimed for 
that to Mary Magdalene. The second must have been the meeting of Jesus with the 
women returning from the grave, in Matthew; but as Mary Magdalene was likewise 
among these, and there is no indication that she had previously seen Jesus, 
these two appearances cannot be regarded as distinct, but rather as one under 
two different garbs. Paul, who in the above named passage speaks as if he meant 
to enumerate all the appearances of the resuscitated Christ, of which he knew, 
omits the one in question; but it may perhaps be said in explanation of this, 
that he did not choose to adduce the testimony of women. As the order in which 
he enumerates his Christophanies, to judge from the succession of
<font FACE="Symbol">eita</font><i> </i>and <font FACE="Symbol">epeita</font><i>
</i>and the conclusion with <font FACE="Symbol">escaton</font>, appears to be 
the order of time : <sup>* </sup>according to him the appearance before Cephas 
was the first that happened before a man. This would agree well with the 
representation of Luke, in which the journeyers to Emmaus, on rejoining the 
disciples in Jerusalem, are met by them with the information that Jesus is 
really arisen and has appeared to Simon, which might possibly be the case before 
his interview with those two disciples. As the next appearance, however, 
according to Luke, we must number that last named, which Paul would not mention, 
perhaps because he chose to adduce only those which were seen by apostles, and 
from among the rest only those which happened </p>
<p>* Vid Billoth’s Commentar, in loc.</p>
<p align="center">828</p>
<p>before great masses of witnesses, or more probably, because it was unknown to 
him. Mark xvi. 12 f. evidently refers to the same appearance; the contradiction, 
that while in Luke the assembled disciples meet those coming from Emmaus with 
the believing exclamation: <i>the Lord is risen, </i>etc., in Mark the<i> </i>
disciples are said to have remained incredulous even to the account of those two 
witnesses, probably proceeds from nothing more than an exaggeration of Mark, who 
will not lose his hold of the contrast between the most convincing appearances 
of Jesus and the obstinate unbelief of the disciples. The appearance on the way 
to Emmaus is in Luke immediately followed by that in the assembly of the <i>
eleven </i>and others. This is generally held to be identical with the 
appearance before the <i>twelve </i>mentioned by Paul, and with that which John 
narrates when Jesus on the evening after the resurrection entered while the 
doors were closed among the disciples, out of whose number, however, Thomas was 
wanting. It is not fair to urge in opposition to this identification the <i>
eleven </i>of Luke, as at variance with the statement of John that only ten 
apostles were present, any more than the <i>twelve </i>of Paul, from which 
number Judas at least must be deducted; moreover the similar manner in which the 
two Evangelists describe the entrance of Jesus by <font FACE="Symbol">esth en 
mesw autwn </font>and <font FACE="Symbol">esth eiV to meson</font><i>, </i>and 
the greeting cited in both instances: <font FACE="Symbol">eirenh umin</font><i>,
</i>appear to indicate the identity of the two appearances; nevertheless, if we 
consider that the handling of the body of Jesus, which in John first happens 
eight days later, and the eating of the broiled fish, which John assigns to the 
still later appearance in Galilee, are connected by Luke with that scene in 
Jerusalem on the day of the resurrection: it is evident that either the third 
Evangelist has here compressed several incidents into one,<sub> </sub>or the 
fourth has divided one into several—whichever alternative may be chosen. This 
appearance before the apostles in Jerusalem however, as has been above remarked, 
according to Matthew could not have happened, since this Evangelist makes the <i>
eleven </i>journey to Galilee in order to see Jesus. Mark, and Luke in his 
gospel, annex the ascension to this appearance, and thus exclude all subsequent 
ones. As the next appearance, the apostle Paul has that before five hundred 
brethren, which is generally regarded as the same with the one which Matthew 
places on a mountain in Galilee : <sup>* </sup>but at this only the eleven are 
stated to have been present, and moreover the discourse of Jesus on the 
occasion, consisting principally of official instructions, appears more suited 
to this narrow circle. Paul next adduces an appearance to James, of which there 
is also an apocryphal account, in the Hebrew gospel of Jerome, according to 
which however it must have been the first of all<sup>† </sup>Here there would be

<p align="center">829</p>
<p>space for that appearance in which, according to the fourth gospel eight days 
after the resurrection of Jesus, Thomas was convinced; wherewith Paul would 
closely agree, if his expression, <i>to all the apostles</i>,
<font FACE="Symbol">toiV apostoloiV pasin </font>(v. 7), which he uses in 
relation to this appearance, were really to be understood of a full assembly of 
the eleven in distinction from the earlier one, when Thomas was not present: 
which however, as Paul, according to the above presupposition, had described 
this also as an appearance before <i>the twelve, </i>is impossible; on the 
contrary, the apostle intends as well by the <font FACE="Symbol">dwdeka, </font>
<i>twelve, </i>as by <font FACE="Symbol">apostoloi panteV</font>, <i>all the 
apostles, </i>the collective body of apostles (whose proper number was then 
indeed incomplete by one man), in opposition to the individuals (Cephas and 
James) of whom in each case he had just before spoken, as having witnessed a 
Christophany. If however we were nevertheless to regard the fifth appearance of 
Jesus according to Paul as identical with the third in John: it would only be 
the more clearly evident that the fourth of Paul, before the five hundred 
brethren, cannot have been the one in Galilee recorded by Matthew. For as, in 
John, the third took place in Jerusalem, the fourth in Galilee: Jesus and the 
apostles must in that case have gone into Galilee after the first appearances in 
Jerusalem, and have met on the mountain; then have returned to Jerusalem where 
Jesus showed himself to Thomas; then again have proceeded into Galilee where the 
appearance by the sea occurred; and lastly, have once more returned to Jerusalem 
for the ascension. In order to avoid this useless journeying backwards and 
forwards, and yet to be able to combine those two appearances, Olshausen lays 
the appearance before Thomas in Galilee: an inadmissible violence, since not 
only is there no mention of a change of place between this and the foregoing, 
which is by implication represented as happening in Jerusalem, but the place of 
assembly is in both instances described in the same manner; nay the addition, <i>
the</i> <i>doors being shut, </i>will not allow the supposition of any other 
locality than Jerusalem, because in Galilee, where there was less excitement 
against Jesus from the enmity of the priesthood, there cannot be supposed to 
have been the same reason for that precaution, in <i>the fear of the Jews. </i>
Thus, first where the Judean appearances close with that happening eight days 
after the resurrection, we should obtain room to insert the Galilean appearances 
of Matthew and John. But these have the peculiar position, that each claims to 
be the first, and that of Matthew at the same time the last.<sup>* </sup>By the 
tenor of his whole narrative, and </p>
<p>* Lessing, Duplik, s.<i> </i>449 ff.</p>
<p align="center">830</p>
<p>expressly by adding, after the statement that the disciples went to a 
mountain in Galilee, the words: <i>where Jesus had appointed them, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">ou etaxato autoiV o I.</font>, Matthew marks this appearance 
as the one to which Jesus had referred on the morning of the resurrection, first 
by the angel, and then in his own person; but no one concerts a second meeting 
in a particular place, leaving the first undetermined: consequently, as an 
unforeseen earlier meeting is incompatible with the evangelical idea of Jesus,<sup>*
</sup>that meeting, since it was the concerted one, was also the first in 
Galilee. if thus the appearance at the sea of Tiberias in John, cannot possibly 
be placed before that on the mountain in Matthew: so the latter will just as 
little suffer the other to follow it, since it is a. formal leave-taking of 
Jesus from his disciples. Moreover, it would be more than ever difficult to 
understand how the appearance in John could be made out, in accordance with the 
Evangelist’s own statement, to be the third <font FACE="Symbol">fanerwsiV</font><i>
</i>of the risen Christ before his disciples (xxi. 14), if that of the first 
gospel must also be supposed to precede it. Meanwhile, even allowing the 
priority to the former, this numerical notice of John remains sufficiently 
perplexing. We might, it is true, deduct the appearances before the women, 
because, though John himself narrates that to Mary Magdalene, he does not take 
it into his account; but if we number that to Cephas as the first, and that on 
the way to Emmaus as the second: then this Galilean appearance, as the third, 
would fall between the above and that before the eleven on the evening of the 
resurrection, which would presuppose a rapidity of locomotion totally 
impossible; nay, if that appearance before the assembled eleven is the same with 
the one at which, according to John, Thomas was absent, the third appearance of 
John would fall before his first. Perhaps, however, when we consider the 
expression : <i>showed himself to his disciples, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
efanerwqh toiV maqhtaiV autou</font><i>, </i>we ought to understand that John 
only numbers such appearances as happened before several disciples at once, so 
that those before Peter and James should be deducted, in that case, we must 
number as the first, the appearance to the two disciples going to Emmaus; as the 
second, that before the assembled eleven on the evening of the resurrection : 
and thus in the eight days between this and the one before Thomas, the journey 
into Galilee would fall somewhat more conveniently,— but also the third 
appearance of John would fall before his second. Perhaps, then, the author of 
the fourth gospel held the two disciples whom Jesus met on the way to Emmaus too 
small a number, to entitle this Christophany to rank as a <font FACE="Symbol">
fanerousqai toiV maqhtaiV</font><i>. </i>On this supposition the entrance of 
Jesus among the assembled disciples in the evening would be the first 
appearance; hereupon the five hundred brethren to whom Jesus showed himself at 
once would surely be numerous enough to be taken into the reckoning: so that the 
Galilean appearance of John, that is, his third, must be inserted after </p>
<p>* As Kern admits, Hauptthats. Tüb. Zeitschr. 1836, 3, s. 57.</p>
<p align="center">831</p>
<p>this, but then it would still fall before that to Thomas and <i>all the 
apostles, </i>which John enumerates as the second. Perhaps, however, the 
appearance of Jesus before the five hundred is to be placed later, so that after 
that entrance of Jesus among the assembled disciples would first follow the 
scene with Thomas, after this the appearance at the sea of Galilee, and only 
then the sight of Jesus granted to the five hundred. But if the appearance 
before Thomas is to he reckoned the same with the fifth in Paul’s enumeration, 
this apostle must have reversed the order of his two last appearances, a 
transposition for which there was no reason : On the contrary, it would have 
been more natural to place last the appearance before the five hundred brethren, 
as the most important. Thus nothing remains but to say: John understood under 
the word <font FACE="Symbol">maqhtaiV </font>merely a greater or a smaller 
assembly of the apostles; but among the five hundred there was no apostle; hence 
he omitted these also, and thus correctly numbered the appearance at the sea of 
Tiberias as the third: if indeed this could have happened before the one on the 
mountain in Galilee, which, we have seen, to be inconceivable. The above 
expedients resorted to by way of accommodation are in part ridiculous enough: 
but Kern has lately surpassed them all by a suggestion which he advances with 
great confidence, namely, that John here intends to number, not the appearances, 
but the days on which appearances took place, so that <font FACE="Symbol">touto 
hdh triton efanerwqh o I. toiV maqhtaiV</font><i>, this is now the third time 
that Jesus showed himself to the disciples, </i>means: now had Jesus already 
appeared to his disciples on three separate days: namely, four times on the day 
of the resurrection; then once eight days after; and now again some days later.<sup>*
</sup>Renouncing such expedients, nothing remains but to acknowledge that the 
fourth Evangelist numbers only those appearances of Jesus to his disciples, 
which he had himself narrated; and the reason of this can scarcely have been 
that the rest, from some cause or other, appeared to him less important, but 
rather that he knew nothing of them.<sup>† </sup>And again, Matthew with his 
last Galilean appearance, can have known nothing of the two in Jerusalem 
recorded by John; for if in the first of these ten apostles had been convinced 
of the reality of the resurrection of Jesus, and in the second Thomas also: it 
could not have been that at that later appearance on the mountain in Galilee 
some of the eleven (for only these are represented by Matthew as going thither) 
still doubted (<font FACE="Symbol">oi de edistasan</font><i>, </i>v. I7). 
Lastly, if Jesus here delivered to his disciples the final command to go into 
all the world teaching and baptizing, and gave them the promise to he with them 
until the end of the existing age, which is manifestly the tone of one who is 
taking leave: he cannot subsequently, as is narrated in the introduction to the 
Acts, have communicated to them his last commands and taken leave of them at 
Jerusalem. According to the conclusion of the gospel of Luke, </p>
<p>* Hauptthatsachen, ut sup. s. 47.</p>
<p>† Comp. De Wette, exeg. Handb. 1<i>, </i>3, s. 205, 210; Weisse, die evang. 
Gesch. <i>2</i>, s<i>. </i>409.</p>
<p align="center">832</p>
<p>this farewell departure on the contrary occurs much earlier than can be 
supposed in accordance with Matthew; and in the close of the gospel of Mark, 
where Jesus is represented as parting from his disciples in Jerusalem on the 
very day of his resurrection, partly the same words are put into his mouth as, 
according to Matthew, are spoken in Galilee, and in any case later than on the 
day of the resurrection. The fact, that the two books of the same author, Luke, 
diverge so widely from each other in relation to the time during which Jesus 
appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, that one determines this time 
to have been a single day, the other, forty days, cannot be taken into more 
particular consideration until we have reached a farther point of our inquiry.</p>
<p>Thus the various evangelical writers only agree as to a few of the 
appearances of Jesus after his resurrection; the designation of the locality in 
one excludes the appearances narrated by the rest; the determination of time in 
another leaves no space for the narratives of his fellow Evangelists; the 
enumeration of a third is given without any regard to the events reported by his 
predecessors; lastly, among several appearances recounted by various narrators, 
each claims to be the last, and yet has nothing in common with the others. Hence 
nothing but wilful blindness can prevent the perception that no one of the 
narrators knew and presupposed what another records; that each again had heard a 
different account of the matter; and that consequently at an early period, there 
were current only uncertain and very varied reports concerning the appearances 
of the risen Jesus.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>This conclusion, however, does not shake the passage in the first Epistle to 
the Corinthians which, (it being undoubtedly genuine,) was written about the 
year 59 after Christ, consequently not 30 years after his resurrection. On this 
authority we must believe that many members of the primitive church who were yet 
living at the time when this epistle was written, especially the apostles, were 
convinced that they had witnessed appearances of the risen Christ. Whether this 
involves the admission that some objective reality lay at the foundation of 
these appearances, will hereafter become the subject of inquiry; concerning the 
present point, the divergencies of the Evangelists, especially in relation to 
the locality, the passage of Paul offers nothing decisive, since he has given no 
particular description of any of those appearances.</p>
<p>§ 139. QUALITY OF THE BODY AND LIFE OF JESUS AFTER THE RESURRECTION.</p>
<p>But how are we to represent to ourselves this continuation of the life of 
Jesus after the resurrection, and especially the nature of </p>

Buch.</p>
<p align="center">833</p>
<p>his body in this period? In order to answer this question we must once more 
cast a glance over the separate narratives of his appearances when risen.</p>
<p>According to Matthew, Jesus on the morning of the resurrection meets (<font FACE="Symbol">aphnthsen</font>)<i>
</i>the women as they are hastening back from the grave; they recognize him, 
embrace his feet in sign of veneration, and he speaks to them. At the second 
interview on the Galilean mountain the disciples see him (<font FACE="Symbol">idonteV</font>)<i>,
</i>but some still doubt, and here also Jesus speaks to them. Of the manner in 
which he came and went, we have here no precise information.</p>
<p>In Luke, Jesus joins the two disciples who are on their way from Jerusalem to 
the neighbouring village of Emmaus (<font FACE="Symbol">eggisaV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">suneporeueto autoiV</font>); they do not recognize him on 
the way, a circumstance which Luke attributes to a subjective hindrance produced 
in them by a higher influence (<font FACE="Symbol">oi ofqalmoi autwn</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">ekratounto, tou mh epignwnai auton</font>),<i> </i>and only 
Mark, who compresses this event into few words, to an objective alteration of 
his form (<font FACE="Symbol">en etera morfh</font>)<i>. </i>On the way Jesus 
converses with the two disciples, after their arrival in the village complies 
with their invitation to accompany them to their lodging, sits down to table 
with them, and proceeds according to his wont to break and distribute bread. In 
this moment the miraculous spell is withdrawn from the eyes of the disciples, 
and they know him : <sup>* </sup>but in the same moment he becomes invisible to 
them (<font FACE="Symbol">afantoV egeneto</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ap</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">autwn</font>).<i>
</i>Just as suddenly as he here vanished, he appears to have shown himself 
immediately after in the assembly of the disciples, when it is said that he all 
at once stood in the midst of them (<font FACE="Symbol">esth en mesw autwn</font>),<i>
</i>and they, terrified at the sight, supposed that they saw a spirit. To dispel 
this alarming idea, Jesus showed them his hands and feet, and invited them to 
touch him, that by feeling his <i>flesh and bones </i>they might convince 
themselves that he was no spectre; he also caused a piece of broiled fish and of 
honeycomb to be brought to him, and ate it in their presence. The appearance to 
Simon is in Luke described by the expression <font FACE="Symbol">wfqh</font><i>;
</i>Paul in the first Epistle to the Corinthians uses the same verb for all the 
Christophanies there enumerated, and Luke in the Acts comprises all the 
appearances of the risen Jesus during the forty days under the expressions
<font FACE="Symbol">optanomenoV </font>(i. 3) and <font FACE="Symbol">emfanh 
genesqai</font><i> </i>(x. 40). In the same manner Mark describes the appearance 
to Mary Magdalene by <font FACE="Symbol">efanh</font><i>, </i>and those to the 
disciples on the way to Emmaus and to the eleven by <font FACE="Symbol">
efanerwqh</font><i>. </i>John describes the appearance at the sea of Tiberias by
<font FACE="Symbol">efanerwsen eauton</font><i>, </i>and to all the 
Christophanies narrated by him he applies the word <font FACE="Symbol">efanerwqh</font><i>.
</i>Mark and Luke add, as the close of the earthly life of the risen Jesus, that 
he was taken away from before the eyes of the disciples, and (by a cloud, 
according to Acts i. 9) carried up to heaven.</p>
<p>* That it was the marks of the nails in the hand, which became visible in the 
act of breaking bread, by which Jesus was recognized (Paulus, exeg. Handb. 3, b. 
s. 882; Kuinol, in Luc. p. 734.) is without any intimation in the text.</p>
<p align="center">834</p>
<p>In the fourth gospel Jesus first stands behind Mary Magdalene as she is 
turning away from the grave; she however, does not recognize him even when he 
speaks to her, but takes him for the gardener, until he (in the tone so familiar 
to her) calls her by her name. When on this she attempts to manifest her 
veneration, Jesus prevents her by the words: <i>Touch me not, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">mh mou aptou</font><i>, </i>and sends her with a message to 
the disciples. The second appearance of Jesus in John occurred under peculiarly 
remarkable circumstances. The disciples were assembled, from fear of the hostile 
Jews, with closed doors: when all at once Jesus came and stood in the midst of 
them, greeted them, and presented— apparently to their sight only—his hands and 
feet, that they might recognize him as their crucified master. When Thomas, who 
was not present, refused to be convinced by the account of his fellow disciples 
of the reality of this appearance, and required for his satisfaction himself to 
see and touch the wounds of Jesus : the latter, in an appearance eight days 
after, granted him this proof, making him touch the marks of the nails in his 
hands and the wound in his side. Lastly, at the appearance by the sea of 
Galilee, Jesus stood on the shore in the morning twilight, without being known 
by the disciples in the ship, asked them for fish, and was at length recognized 
by John, through the rich draught of fishes which he procured them; still, how 
ever, the disciples, when come to land, did not venture to ask him whether it 
were really he. Hereupon he distributed among them bread and fish, of which he 
doubtless himself partook, and finally held a conversation with John and Peter.<sup>*
</p>
</sup>
<p>Now the general ideas which may bc formed of the life of Jesus after his 
resurrection are two: either it was a natural and perfectly human life, and 
accordingly his body continued to be subject to the physical and organic laws; 
or his life was already of a higher, </p>
<p>* The part of this conversation which relates to John, has already (§ 116) 
been considered. In that relating to Peter, the thrice repeated question of 
Jesus: <i>Lovest thou me? </i>has reference, according to the ordinary opinion, 
to his as often repeated denial ; but to the words : <i>When thou wast young, 
thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest, but when thou shall 
be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shalt gird thee, and 
carry thee whither thou wouldest not, </i>(v. 18 f.), the Evangelist himself 
gives the interpretation, that Jesus spoke them to Peter, <i>signifying by what 
death he should glorify God. </i>He must here have alluded to the crucifixion, 
which, according to the ecclesiastical legend (Tertull. de præscr. hær. xxxvi. 
Euseb. H. E. ii. 25) was the death suffered by this apostle, and to which in the 
intention of the Evangelist the words <i>follow me, </i>v. 20 and 22 (i.e. 
follow me in the same mode of death) also appear to point. But precisely the 
main feature in this interpretation, the stretching forth of the hands, is here 
so placed as to render a reference to crucifixion impossible, namely, before the 
leading away against the will; on the other hand, the girding, which can only 
signify binding for the purpose of leading away, should stand before the 
stretching forth of the hands on the cross. If we set aside the interpretation 
which, as even Lücke (s. 703) admits, is given to the words of Jesus <i>ex</i>
<i>eventu </i>by the narrator : they appear to contain nothing more than the 
commonplace of the helplessness of age contrasted with the activity of youth, 
for even the phrase, <i>shall carry thee whither thou wouldest not, </i>does not 
outstep this comparison. But the author of John xxi., whether the words were 
known to him as a declaration of Jesus or otherwise, thought them capable of 
being applied in the manner of the fourth gospel, as a latent prophecy of the 
crucifixion of Peter.</p>
<p align="center">835</p>
<p>superhuman character, and his body supernatural and transfigured: and the 
accounts, taken unitedly, present certain traits to which, on the first view, 
each of these two ideas may respectively appeal. The human form with its natural 
members, the possibility of being known by means of them, the continuance of the 
marks of the wounds, the human speech, the acts of walking and breaking 
bread,—all these appear to speak in favour of a perfectly nattiral life on the 
part of Jesus even after the resurrection. If it were possible still to demur to 
this, and to conjecture, that even a higher, heavenly corporeality might give 
itself such an aspect and perform such functions : all doubts must be quelled by 
the further statement, that Jesus after the resurrection consumed earthly food, 
and allowed himself to be touched. Such things are indeed ascribed even to 
higher beings in old myths, as for example, eating to the heavenly forms from 
whom Abraham received a visit (Gen. xviii. 8), and palpability to the God that 
wrestled with Jacob (Gen. xxxii. 24 ff.<i>): </i>but it must nevertheless be 
insisted that in reality both these conditions can only belong to material, 
organized bodies. Hence not only the rationalists, but even orthodox expositors, 
consider these particulars as an irrefragable proof that the body and life of 
Jesus after the resurrection must be regarded as remaining still natural and 
human.<sup>* </sup>This opinion is further supported by the remark, that in the 
state of the risen Jesus there is observable precisely the same progress as 
might be expected in the gradual, natural cure of a person severely wounded. In 
the first hours after the resurrection he is obliged to remain in the vicinity 
of the grave; in the afternoon his strength suffices for a walk to the 
neighbouring village of Emnaus; and only later is he able to undertake the more 
distant journey into Galilee. Then also in the permission to touch his body 
there exists the remarkable gradation, that on the morning of the resurrection 
Jesus forbids Mary Magdalene to touch him, because his wounded body was as yet 
too suffering and sensitive; but eight days later, he himself invites Thomas to 
touch his wounds. Even the circumstance that Jesus after his resurrection was so 
seldom with his disciples and for so short a time, is, according to this 
explanation, a proof that he had brought from the grave his natural, human body, 
for such an one would necessarily feel so weak from the wounds and torture of 
the cross, as always after short periods of exertion to require longer intervals 
of quiet retirement.</p>
<p>But the New Testament narratives, as we have seen, also contain particulars 
which favour the opposite idea of the corporeality of Jesus after the 
resurrection : hence the advocates of the opinion hitherto detailed must 
undertake so to interpret these apparently antagonistic features that they may 
no longer present a contradiction. Here it may seem that the very expressions by 
which the appearances of Jesus are ordinarily introduced, as <font FACE="Symbol">
wfqh</font>, used of the<i> </p>

<p align="center">836</p>
<p>appearance in the burning bush (Exod. <i>iii </i>2,<i> </i>LXX.);
<font FACE="Symbol">optanomenoV</font><i>, </i>of the appearance of the angel in 
Tobit xii. 19; <font FACE="Symbol">efanh</font><i>, </i>of the angelic 
appearances in Matt. i. and ii., may seem already to point to something 
supernatural. As still more decided indications, the idea of a natural going and 
coming which may be presupposed in some scenes, is contradicted in others by a 
sudden appearance and disappearance; the<i> </i>supposition of an ordinary human 
body is opposed by the frequent non-recognition on the part of friends, nay, by 
the express mention of <i>another form,</i> <font FACE="Symbol">etera morfh</font><i>;
</i>above all, the palpability of the body of Jesus appears to be opposed by the 
capability which, according to the first impression from the text, is lent to 
him in John, namely, that of entering through closed doors. But, that Mary 
Magdalene mistook Jesus at first for the gardener, is thought even by 
commentators who ordinarily are not diffident of the miraculous, to be most 
probably accounted for by the supposition that Jesus had borrowed clothes from 
the gardener, who very likely dwelt near to the grave; moreover, say these 
writers, both in this instance and in the journey to Emmaus, the disfiguration 
of the countenance of Jesus by the sufferings of crucifixion may have 
contributed to prevent his being recognized, and these two circumstances are 
alone to be understood from the expression <font FACE="Symbol">etera morfh</font><i>, 
another form, </i>in Mark.<sup>* </sup>As to the disciples going to Emmaus, in 
the joyful astonishment caused by the sudden recognition of him whom they had 
believed dead, Jesus, it is said, may easily have withdrawn from them unobserved 
in the most natural manner; which, however, they, to whom the whole fact of the 
resuscitation of Jesus was a miracle, might regard as a supernatural 
disappearance.<sup>† </sup>Nor, we are told, do the expressions :
<font FACE="Symbol">esth en mesw autwn </font>or <font FACE="Symbol">eiV to 
meson </font><i>he stood in the midst of them, </i>especially in John, where 
they are accompanied by the ordinary words <font FACE="Symbol">hlqen </font><i>
he came, </i>and <font FACE="Symbol">ercetai </font><i>he comes, </i>imply 
anything supernatural, but merely the startling arrival of one who had just been 
spoken of, without his being expected; and the assembled disciples took him for 
a spirit, not because he entered in a miraculous manner, but because they could 
not believe in the real resuscitation of their deceased master.<sup>‡ </sup>
Lastly, even the trait which is supposed to be decisive against the opinion that 
the body of the risen Jesus was a natural and human one,— the coming when the 
doors were shut <font FACE="Symbol">ercetai qurwn kekleismenwn </font>in 
John,—has long been interpreted even by orthodox theologians so as no longer to 
present any obstacle to that opinion. We will not discuss explanations such as 
that of Heumann, according to which the <i>doors </i>were not those of the house 
in which the disciples were assembled, but the doors of Jerusalem in general, 
and the statement that they were shut is an intimation of its having been that 
hour of the night in which it was customary to close the </p>

natural explanation has lately been adopted by Lücke, from Hug.</p>

<p>‡ Paubus, ut sup. 883, 93; Lücke, 2, s. 684 f.</p>
<p align="center">837</p>
<p>doors, while the <i>fear of the Jews </i>represents the motive, not for the 
closing of the doors, but for the assembling of the disciples. Apart from these 
expedients, Calvin himself pronounces the opinion that the body of the risen 
Jesus passed <i>per medium ferrum et asseres, </i>to be <i>pueriles argutiæ, </i>
for which the text gives no occasion, since it does not say that Jesus entered
<i>per januas clausas, </i>but only that he suddenly appeared among his 
disciples, <i>cum clausæ essent januae.</i><sup>* </sup>Still Calvin upholds the 
entrance of Jesus of which John here speaks as a miracle, which must 
consequently be supposed to consist in this, that Jesus entered <i>cum fores 
clausae fuissent, sed quæ Domino veniente subilo patuerunt ad nutum divinæ 
majestatis ejus.</i><sup>† </sup>While more modern orthodox divines only contend 
for the less definite position, that in the entrance of Jesus some miracle took 
place, its precise character being unascertained : <sup>‡ </sup>Rationalism has 
found means entirely to banish the miraculous from the event. The closed doors, 
we are told, were opened to Jesus by human hands; which John omits to notice, 
only because it is understood as a matter of course, nay, it would have been 
absurd of him to say: they opened the doors for him, and he went in. <sup>§ </p>
</sup>
<p>But in thus interpreting the words <font FACE="Symbol">ercetai qurwn 
kekleismenwn</font><i>, </i>theologians have been by no means unprejudiced. 
Least of all Calvin; for when he says, the papists maintain a real penetration 
of the body of Jesus through closed doors in order to gain support for their 
tenet that the body of Christ is immense, and contained in no place, <i>ul 
corpus Christi immensum esse, nulloque loco contineri obtineant: </i>it is plain 
that he combats that interpretation of the words of John merely to avoid giving 
any countenance to the offensive doctrine of the ubiquity of Christ’s body. The 
more modern expositors, on the other hand, were interested in avoiding the 
contradiction which to our perceptions is contained in the statement, that a 
body can consist of solid matter, and yet pass without hindrance through other 
solid matter: but as we know not whether this was also a contradiction in the 
view of the New Testament writers, the apprehension of it gives us no authority 
to discard that interpretation, providing it be shown to be in accordance with 
the text. We might certainly, on a partial consideration, understand the 
expression <i>the doors being shut, </i><font FACE="Symbol">twn qurwn 
kekleismenwn</font>, as an intimation of the anxious state into which the 
disciples were thrown by the death of Jesus. But already the circumstance that 
this particular is repeated on the appearance of Jesus before Thomas excites 
doubts, since if the above was the only meaning, it was scarcely worth while to 
repeat the observation.<sup>|| </sup>But as in fact in this second instance the 
above cause for the closing of the doors no longer exists, while the words

<p>he comes </i>: what was before the most apparent meaning, namely, that they 
are intended to determine the manner of the coming of Jesus, is here heightened 
into a probability.<sup>* </sup>Further, the repeated statement that Jesus came 
when the doors were closed is again followed by the words <font FACE="Symbol">
esth eiV to meswn</font><i>, </i>which even in connexion with
<font FACE="Symbol">hlqen</font>, to which they are related as a more precise 
determination, imply that Jesus suddenly presented himself, without his approach 
having been seen: whence it is undeniably evident that the writer here speaks of 
a coming without the ordinary means, consequently, of a miraculous coming. But 
did this miracle consist in passing through the boards of the doors? This is 
combated even by those who espouse the cause of miracles in general, and they 
confidently appeal to the fact, that it is nowhere said, he entered <i>through
</i>the closed doors <font FACE="Symbol">dia twn qurwn kekleismenon</font><i>.</i><sup>†</sup>
<sup><i></i></sup>But the Evangelist does not mean to convey the precise notion 
that Jesus, as Michaelis expresses himself, passed straight through the pores of 
the wood of which the doors were made; he merely means that the doors were shut 
and remained so, and nevertheless Jesus suddenly stood in the chamber,—walls, 
doors, in short all material barriers, forming no obstacle to his entrance. Thus 
in reply to their unjust demand of us, to show them in the text of John a 
precise determination which is quite away from the intention of this writer, we 
must ask them to explain why he has not noticed the (miraculous) opening of the 
doors, if he presupposed such a circumstance? in relation to this point Calvin 
very infelicitously refers to Acts xii. 6 ff.<i>, </i>where it is narrated of 
Peter, that he came out of the closed prison; no one, he says, here supposes 
that the doors remained closed, and that Peter penetrated through wood and iron. 
Assuredly not; because here it is expressly said of the iron gate of the prison 
which led into the city, that it <i>opened to him of its own aœord </i>(v. 10). 
This observation serves to give so lively and graphic an idea of the miracle, 
that our Evangelist would certainly not, in two instances, have omitted a 
similar one, if he had thought of a miraculous opening of the doors.</p>
<p>Thus in this narrative of John the supernatural will not admit of being 
removed or diminished : nor is the natural explanation more satisfactory in 
relation to the expressions by which Luke describes the coming and going of 
Jesus. For if, according to this Evangelist, his coming was <i>a standing in the 
midst of the disciples, </i><font FACE="Symbol">sthnai</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">en mesw twn maqhtwn</font><i>, </i>his going <i>a becoming 
invisible to them, </i><font FACE="Symbol">afantoV ginesqai ap</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">autwn</font>: 
the concurrence of these two representations, taken in connexion with the terror 
of the disciples and their mistaking him for a spirit, will hardly allow the 
supposition of anything else than a miraculous appearance. Besides, if we might 
perhaps form some idea how Jesus could enter in a natural manner without being 
observed into a room filled with men: we should still be at a loss to imagine 
how it could be possible for him, when he </p>
<p>* Comp. Olshausen, 2, s. 531, Anm.</p>
<p>† Thus, besides Calvin, Lücke, ut sup. ; Olshausen, 530</p>
<p align="center">839</p>
<p>sat at table at Emmaus, apparently with the two disciples alone, to withdraw 
himself from them unobserved, and so that they were not able to follow him.<sup>*
</p>
</sup>
<p>That Mark, under the words <font FACE="Symbol">etera morfh</font><i> </i>
understands a form miraculously altered, ought never to have been denied; <sup>†
</sup>but this is a point of minor importance, because it involves only the 
narrator’s own interpretation of the circumstance which had been already stated, 
but with a different explanation, by Luke: namely, that the two disciples did 
not know Jesus. That Mary Magdalene took Jesus for the gardener, was hardly, in 
the view of the Evangelist, the consequence of his having borrowed the 
gardener’s clothes: rather, the spirit of the narrative would require us to 
explain her not knowing him by supposing that her eyes were <i>held </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">krateisqai</font><i>, </i>Luke xxiv. 16), or that Jesus had 
assumed <i>another form </i>; while her taking him for the gardener might then 
be simply accounted for by the fact that she met the unknown man in the garden. 
Nor are we authorized by the evangelical narratives to suppose a disfiguration 
of Jesus by the sufferings of the cross, and a gradual healing of his wounds. 
The words <i>Touch me not </i>in John, if they were to be regarded as a 
prohibition of a touch as painful, would be in contradiction, not merely with 
Matthew, according to whom Jesus on the same morning—that of the resurrection 
—allowed the women to embrace his feet, but also with Luke, according to whom he 
on the same day invited the disciples to handle him; and we must then ask, which 
representation is correct? But there is nothing at all in the context to 
intimate that Jesus forbade Mary to touch him for fear of pain; he may have done 
so from various motives: concerning which, however, the obscurity of the passage 
has hitherto precluded any decision.<sup>‡ </p>
</sup>
<p>But the most singularly perverted inference is this: that the infrequent and 
brief interviews of Jesus with his disciples after the resurrection are a proof 
that he was as yet too weak for long and multiplied efforts, arid consequently 
was undergoing a natural cure. On this very supposition of his needing bodily 
tendance, he should have been not seldom, but constantly, with his disciples, 
who were those from whom he could the most immediately expect such tendance. For 
where are we to suppose that he dwelt in the long intervals between his 
appearances? in solitude? in the open air? in the wilderness and on mountains? 
That was no suitable abode for an invalid, and nothing remains but to suppose 
that he must have been concealed among secret colleagues of whom even his 
disciples knew nothing. But thus to conceal his real abode even from his own 
disciples, to show himself to them only seldom, and designedly </p>

</i>
<p>‡ See the various explanations in Tholuck and Lücke, of whom the latter finds 
an alteration of the reading necessary. Even Weisse’s interpretation of the 
words (2, s. 395 ff.), although I agree with the general tenor of the 
explanation of which it forms a part, I must regard as a failure.</p>
<p align="center">840</p>
<p>to present and withdraw himself suddenly, would be a kind of double dealing, 
an affectation of the supernatural, which would exhibit Jesus and his cause in a 
light foreign to the object itself so far as it lies before us in our original 
sources of information, and only thrown upon it by the dark lantern of modern, 
yet already obsolete, conceptions. The opinion of the Evangelists is no other 
than that the risen Jesus, after those short appearances among his followers, 
withdrew like a higher being into invisibility, from which, on fitting 
occasions, he again stept forth. <sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>Lastly, on the presupposition that Jesus by his resurrection returned to a 
purely natural existence, what conception must be formed of his end? In 
consistency he must be supposed, whether at the end of a longer <sup>† </sup>or 
a shorter time after his resuscitation, to have died a natural death; and 
accordingly Paulus intimates that the too intensely affected body of Jesus, 
notwithstanding it had recovered from the death-like rigidity produced by 
crucifixion, was yet completely worn out by natural maladies and consuming 
fever.<sup>‡ </sup>That this is at least not the view of the Evangelists 
concerning the end of Jesus is evident, since two of them represent him as 
taking leave of his disciples like an immortal, the others as being visibly 
carried up to heaven. Thus before the ascension, at the latest, if until then 
Jesus had retained a natural human body, it must have undergone a change which 
qualified him to dwell in the heavenly regions; the sediment of gross 
corporeality must have fallen to the earth, and only its finest essence have 
ascended. But of any natural remains of the ascended Jesus the Evangelists say 
nothing; and as the disciples who were spectators of his ascension must have 
observed them had there been such, nothing is left for the upholders of this 
opinion but the expedient of certain theologians of the Tübingen school, who 
regard as the residuum of the corporeality of Jesus, the cloud which enveloped 
him in his ascension, and in which what was material in him is supposed to have 
been dissolved and as it were evaporated.<sup>§ </sup>As thus the Evangelists 
neither represent to themselves the end of the earthly life of Jesus after the 
resurrection as a natural death, nor mention any change undergone by his body at 
the ascension, and moreover narrate of Jesus in the interval between the 
resurrection and ascension things which are inconceivable of a natural body:</p>
<p>they cannot have represented to themselves his life after the resurrection as 
natural, but only as supernatural, nor his body as material and organic, but 
only as transfigured.</p>
<p>In the point of view held by the Evangelists, this conception is not 
contradicted even by those particulars which the friends of the </p>

<p align="center">841</p>
<p>purely natural opinion respecting the life of the risen Jesus are accustomed 
to urge in their support. That Jesus ate and drank was, in the circle of ideas 
within which the gospels originated, as far from presupposing a real necessity, 
as the meal of which Jehovah partook with two angels in the tent of Abraham: the 
power of eating is here no proof of a necessity for eating.<sup>* </sup>That he 
caused himself to be touched, was the only possible mode of refuting the 
conjecture that an incorporeal spectre had appeared to the disciples; moreover, 
divine existences, not merely in Grecian, but also (according to the passage 
above quoted, Gen. xxxii. 24) in Hebrew antiquity, sometimes appeared palpable, 
in distinction from unsubstantial shades, though they otherwise showed 
themselves as little bound by the laws of materiality as the palpable Jesus, 
when he suddenly vanished, and was able to penetrate without hindrance into a 
room of which the door was closed.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>It is quite another question, whether on our more advanced position, and with 
our more correct knowledge of nature, those two different classes of particulars 
can be held compatible with each other. Here we must certainly say: a body which 
consumes visible food, must itself be visible; the consumption of food 
presupposes an organism, but an organism is organized matter, and this has not 
the property of alternately vanishing and becoming visible again at will.<sup>‡
</sup>More especially, if the body of Jesus was capable of being felt, and 
presented perceptible flesh and bones, it thus exhibited the impenetrability of 
matter, proper to it as solid: if on the other hand he was able to pass into 
closed houses and rooms, unhindered by the interposition of walls and doors, he 
thus proved that the impenetrability of solid matter did not belong to him. 
Since then according to the evangelical accounts he, must at the same time have 
had and not have had the same property: the evangelical representation of the 
corporeality of Jesus after the resurrection is manifested to be contradictory. 
And this contradiction is not of such a kind that it is divided among the 
different narrators; but the accotint of one and the same Evangelist includes 
those contradictory features within itself. The brief account of Matthew, it is 
true, implies in the embracing of the feet of Jesus by the women (v. 9) only the 
attribute of palpability, </p>
<p>* Joann. Damasc. de f. orth 4, 1.<i> </p>
</i>
<p>† The vagueness of the conception which lies at the foundation of the 
evangelical accounts is well expressed by Origen, when he says of Jesus:<i> 
After the resurrection, he existed in a form which held the mean between the 
materiality of his body before his passion, and the state of the soul when 
altogether destitute of such body </i>(c. CeIs. ii. 62.)</p>
<p>‡ Hence even Kern admits that he knows not how to reconcile that particular 
in Luke with the rest, and regards it as of later, traditional origin 
(Hauptthats., ut sup. s 50). But what does this admission avail him, since he 
still has, from the narrative of John, the quality of palpability, which equally 
with the act of eating belongs to the &quot;conditions of earthly life, the relations 
of the material world,&quot; to which the body of the risen Jesus, according to 
Kern’s own presupposition, &quot;was no longer subjected.&quot;<i>?</p>
</i>
<p align="center">842</p>
<p>without at the same time presenting an opposite one; with Mark the case is 
reversed, his statement that Jesus appeared <i>in another form </i>(v. 12) 
implying something supernatural, while on the other hand he does not decidedly 
presuppose the opposite; in Luke, on the other hand, the permission to touch his 
body and the act of eating speak as decidedly in favour of organic materiality, 
as the sudden appearance and disappearance speak against it; but the members of 
this contradiction come the most directly into collision in John, where Jesus, 
immediately after he has entered into the closed room unimpeded by walls and 
doors,<sup>* </sup>causes the doubting Thomas to touch him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>§ 140. DEBATES CONCERNING THE REALITY OF THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF 
JESUS.*</p>
<p>The proposition: a dead man has returned to life, is composed of two such 
contradictory elements, that whenever it is attempted to maintain the one, the 
other threatens to disappear. If he has really returned to life, it is natural 
to conclude that he was not wholly dead; if he was really dead, it is difficult 
to believe that he has really become living.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>When we form a correct opinion of the relation between soul and body, not 
abstractly separating the two, but conceiving them at once in their identity, 
the soul as the interior of the body, the body as the exterior of the soul, we 
know not how to imagine, to say nothing of comprehending, the revivification of 
a dead person. What we call the soul is the governing centre which holds in 
combination the powers and operations of the body; its function, or rather the 
soul itself, consists in keeping all other processes of which the body is 
susceptible in uninterrupted subjection to the superior unity of the process of 
organic life, which in man is the basis of his spiritual nature: so soon as this 
regulating power ceases to act, the supremacy in the various parts of the body 
is assumed by these other, inferior principles, whose work in its prosecution is 
corruption. When once these have acceded to the dominion, they will not be 
inclined to render it back to their former monarch, the soul; or rather this is 
impossible, because, quite apart from the question of the immortality of the 
human spirit <i>(Geist), </i>the soul <i>(Seele) </i>as such ceases in the same 
moment with its dominion and activity, which constitute its existence; 
consequently, in a revivification, even if resort be had to a miracle, this must 
consist in the direct creation of a new soul.</p>
<p>* Many fathers of the church and orthodox theologians held the capability 
thus exhibited by Jesus of penetrating through closed doors, not altogether 
reconcileable with the representation, that for the purpose of the resurrection 
the stone was rolled away from the grave, and hence maintained <i>: resurrexit 
Christus clauso sepulchro, sive nondum ab ostio sepulchri revoluto per angelum 
lapide. </i>Quenstedt, theol. didact. polem. 3, p. 542.</p>
<p>† Comp. Schleiermacher’s Weihnachtsfeier, s. 117 f.</p>
<p align="center">843</p>
<p>Only in the dualism which has become popular on the subject of the relation 
between body and soul, is there anything to favour the opinion of the 
possibility of a revivification properly so called. In this system, the soul in 
its relation to the body is represented as like a bird, which, though it may for 
a time have flown out of the cage, can yet be once more caught and replaced in 
its former abode; and it is to such figures that an imaginative species of 
thought cleaves, in order to preserve the notion of revivification. But even in 
this dualistic view, the inconceivability of such an event is rather concealed 
than really diminished. For in the most abstract separation, the co-existence of 
the body and soul cannot be held as indifferent and lifeless as that of a box 
and its contents; on the contrary, the presence of the soul in the body produces 
effects, which again are the conditions whereby that presence is rendered 
possible. Thus so soon as the soul has forsaken the body, there is a cessation 
in the latter of those activities which according to the dualistic idea were the 
immediate expressions of the influence of the soul; at the same time, the organs 
of these activities—brain, blood, etc., begin to stagnate; a change which is 
coincident with the moment of death. Thus if it could occur to the departed 
soul, or be imposed on it by another, to re-enter its former dwelling-place: it 
would find this dwelling, even after the first moments, uninhabitable in its 
noblest parts, and unfit for use. To restore, in the same way as an infirm 
member, the most immediate organs of its activity, is an impossibility to the 
soul, since in order to effect anything in the body it has need of the service 
of these very organs: thus the soul, although remanded into the body, must 
suffer it to decay, from inability to exercise any influence over it; or there 
must be added to the miracle of its reconveyance into the body, the second 
miracle of a restoration of the lifeless bodily organs: an immediate 
interposition of God in the regular course of nature, irreconcileable with 
enlightened ideas of the relation of God to the world.</p>
<p>Hence the cultivated intellect of the present day has very decidedly stated 
the following dilemma: either Jesus was not really dead, or he did not really 
rise again.</p>
<p>Rationalism has principally given its adhesion to the former opinion. The 
short time that Jesus hung on the cross, together with the otherwise ascertained 
tardiness of death by crucifixion, and the uncertain nature and effects of the 
wound from the spear, appeared to render the reality of the death doubtful. That 
the agents in the crucifixion, as well as the disciples themselves, entertained 
no such doubt, would be explained not only by the general difficulty of 
distinguishing deep swoons and the rigidity of syncope from real death, but also 
from the low state of medical science in that age; while at least one example of 
the restoration of a crucified person appeared to render conceivable a 
resuscitation in the case of Jesus also. This example is found in Josephus, who 
informs us that of three crucified acquaintances whose release he begged from 
Titus, two died </p>
<p align="center">844</p>
<p>after being taken down from the cross, but one survived.<sup>* </sup>How long 
these people had hung on the cross Josephus does not mention; but from the 
manner in which he connects them with his expedition to Thekoah, by stating that 
he saw them on his return from thence, they must probably have been crucified 
during this expedition, and as this, from the trifling distance of the above 
place from Jerusalem, might possibly be achieved in a day, they had in all 
probability not hung on the cross more than a day, and perhaps a yet shorter 
time. These three persons, then, can scarcely have hung much longer than Jesus, 
who, according to Mark, was on the cross from nine in the morning till towards 
six in the evening, and they were apparently taken down while they still showed 
signs of life; yet with the most careful medical tendance only one survived. 
Truly it is difficult to perceive how it can hence be shown probable that Jesus, 
who when taken from the cross showed all the signs of death, should have come to 
life entirely of himself, without the application of medical skill.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>According to a certain opinion, however, these two conditions—some remains of 
conscious life, and careful medical treatment—were not wanting in the case of 
Jesus, although they are not mentioned by the Evangelists. Jesus, we are told, 
seeing no other way of purifying the prevalent messianic idea from the admixture 
of material and political hopes, exposed himself to crucifixion, but in doing so 
relied on the possibility of procuring a speedy removal from the cross by early 
bowing his head, and of being afterwards restored by the medical skill of some 
among his secret colleagues; so as to inspirit the people at the same time by 
the appearance of a resurrection.<sup>‡ </sup>Others have at least exonerated 
Jesus from such contrivance, and have admitted that be really sank into a 
deathlike slumber; but have ascribed to his disciples a preconceived plan of 
producing apparent death by means of a potion, and thus by occasioning his early 
removal from the cross, securing</p>

<p>his restoration to life.|| But of all </p>

<p>this our evangelical sources give no intimation, and for conjecturing such 
details we have no ground. Judicious friends of the natural explanation, who 
repudiate such monstrous productions of a system which remodels history at will, 
have hence renounced the supposition of any remains of conscious life in Jesus, 
and have contented themselves, for the explanation of his revivification, with 
the vital force which remained in his still young and vigorous body, even after 
the cessation of consciousness; and have pointed out, instead of premeditated 
tendance by the hands of men, the beneficial influence which the partly 
oleaginous substances applied to his body must have had in promoting the healing 
of his wounds, and, united with the air in the cave, impregnated with the 
perfumes of the spices, in reawakening feeling and consciousness in Jesus <sup>*
</sup>to all which was added as a decisive impulse, the earthquake and the 
lightning which on the morning of the resurrection opened the grave of Jesus.<sup>†
</sup>Others have remarked, in opposition to this, that the cold air in the cave 
must have had anything rather than a vivifying tendency; that strong aromatics 
in a confined space would rather have had a stupefying and stifling influence;
<sup>‡ </sup>and the same effect must have been produced by a flash of lightning 
bursting into the grave, if this were not a mere figment of rationalistic 
expositors.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these improbabilities, which are against the opinion that 
Jesus came to life after a merely apparent death by the operation of natural 
causes, this nevertheless remains so far possible, that if we had secure 
evidence of the resuscitation of Jesus, we might, on the strength of such 
certainty as to the result, supply the omissions in the narrative, and approve 
the opinion above presented,—with the rejection, however, of all precise 
conjectures. Secure evidence of the resurrection of Jesus, would be the 
attestation of it in a decided and accordant manner by impartial witnesses. But 
the impartiality of the alleged witnesses for the resurrection of Jesus, is the 
very point which the opponents of Christianity, from Celsus down to the 
Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist, have invariably called in question. Jesus showed 
himself to his adherents only: why not also to his enemies, that they too might 
be convinced, and that by their testimony posterity might be precluded from 
every conjecture of a designed fraud on the part of his disciples? <sup>§ </sup>
I cannot certainly attach much weight to the replies by which apologists have 
sought to repel this objection, from that of Origen, who says: <i>Christ avoided 
the judge who condemned him, and his enemies, that they might not be smitten 
with blindness ; </i><sup>|| </sup>to the opinions of </p>

<p>the modern theologians, who by their vacillation between the assertion that 
by such an appearance the enemies of Jesus would have been compelled to believe, 
and the opposite one, that they would not have believed even on such 
evidence,—rnutually confute one another.<sup>* </sup>Nevertheless, it can still 
be urged in reply to that objection, that the adherents of Jesus, from their 
hopelessness, which is both unanimously attested by the narratives, and is in 
perfect accordance with the nature of the case, here rise to the rank of 
impartial witnesses. If they had expected a resurrection of Jesus and we had 
then been called upon to believe it on their testimony alone: there would 
certainly be a possibility and perhaps also a probability, if not of an 
intentional deception, yet of an involuntary self-delusion on their part; but 
this possibility vanishes in proportion as the disciples of Jesus lost all hope 
after his death. Now even if it be denied that any one of the gospels proceeded 
immediately from a disciple of Jesus, it is still certain from the epistles of 
Paul and the Acts that the Apostles themselves had the conviction that they had 
seen the risen Jesus. We might then rest satisfied with the evangelical 
testimonies in favour of the resurrection, were but these testimonies in the 
first place sufficiently precise, and in the second, in agreement with 
themselves and with each other. But in fact the testimony of Paul, which is 
intrinsically consistent and is otherwise most important, is so general and 
vague, that taken by itself, it does not carry us beyond the subjective fact, 
that the disciples were convinced of the resurrection of Jesus; while the more 
fully detailed narratives of the gospels, in which the resurrection of Jesus 
appears as an objective fact, are, from the contradictions of which they are 
convicted, incapable of being used as evidence, and in general their account of 
the life of Jesus after his resurrection is not one which has connexion and 
unity, presenting a clear historical idea of the subject, but a fragmentary 
compilation,<sup>† </sup>which presents a series of visions, rather than a 
continuous history.</p>
<p>If we compare with this account of the resurrection of Jesus, the precise and 
internally consistent attestation of his death: we must incline to the other 
side of the dilemma above stated, and be induced to doubt the reality of the 
resurrection rather than that of the death. Hence Celsus chose this alternative, 
deriving the alleged appearance of Jesus after the resurrection, from the 
self-delusion of the disciples, especially the women, either dreaming or waking;

<p>Fragmentist, have adopted the accusation of the Jews in Matthew, namely, that 
the disciples stole the body of Jesus, and afterwards fabricated,, with slender 
agreement, stories of his resurrection and subsequent appearances.<sup>* </sup>
This suspicion is repelled by the remark of Origen, that a spontaneous falsehood 
on the part of the disciples could not possibly have animated them to so 
unflinching an announcement of the resurrection of Jesus amid the greatest 
perils <sup>† </sup>and it is a just argument of modern apologists that the 
astonishing revolution from the deep depression and utter hopelessness of the 
disciples at the death of Jesus, to the strong faith and enthusiasm with which 
they proclaimed him as the Messiah on the succeeding Pentecost, would be 
inexplicable unless in the interim something extraordinarily encouraging had 
taken place—something, in fact, which had convinced them of his</p>
<p>resurrection.<sup>‡ </sup>But that this cause of conviction was precisely a 
real appearance of the risen Jesus—that, indeed it was necessarily an external 
event at all is by no means proved. If we chose to remain on supranatural 
ground, we might with Spinoza suppose that a vision was produced by miraculous 
means in the minds of the disciples, the object of which was to make evident to 
them, in a manner accordant with their powers of comprehension and the ideas of 
their age, that Jesus by his virtuous life had risen from spiritual death, and 
that to those who followed his example he would grant a similar resurrection.<sup>§
</sup>With one foot at least on the same ground stands the supposition of 
Weisse, that the departed spirit of Jesus really acted on the disciples whom he 
had left behind; in connexion with which he refers to the apparitions of 
spirits, the impossibility of which remains unproved.<sup>|| </sup>ln order to 
escape from the magic circle of the supernatural, others have searched for 
natural external causes which might induce the belief that Jesus had risen and 
had been seen after his resurrection. The first impetus to this opinion, it has 
been conjectured, was given by the circumstance that on the second morning after 
the burial his grave was found empty, the linen clothes which lay in it being 
taken first for angels and then for an appearance of the risen Jesus </p>

<p>himself: <sup>* </sup>but if the body of Jesus was not reanimated, how are we 
to suppose that it came out of the grave? Here it would be necessary to recur to 
the supposition of a theft: unless the intimation of John, that Jesus on account 
of haste was laid in a strange grave, were thought available for the conjecture 
that perhaps the owner of the grave caused the corpse to be removed: which 
however the disciples must subsequently have learned, and which in any case has 
too frail a foundation in the solitary statement of the fourth gospel.</p>
<p>Far more fruitful is the appeal to the passage of Paul (1<i> </i>Cor. xv. <i>
5 </i>ff.),<i> </i>as the most appropriate starting point in this inquiry, and 
the key to the comprehension of all the appearances of Jesus after his 
resurrection,<sup>† </sup>When Paul there places the Christophany which occurred 
to himself in the same series with the appearances of Jesus in the days after 
his resurrection : this authorizes us, so far as nothing else stands in the way 
of such an inference, to conclude that, for aught the Apostle knew, those 
earlier appearances were of the same nature with the one experienced by himself. 
Now with respect to the latter as narrated to us in the Acts (ix. 1 ff, xxii. 3 
ff., xxvi 12<i> </i>ff), it is no longer possible, after the analysis of 
Eichhorn<sup>‡ </sup>and Ammon,<sup>§ </sup>to retain it as an external, 
objective appearance of the real Christ; even Neander<sup>|| </sup>does not 
positively dare to maintain more than an internal influence of Christ on the 
mind of Paul, only appending in a very beseeching manner the supposition of an 
external appearance; and even that internal influence he himself renders 
superfluous by detailing the causes which might in a natural manner produce such 
a revolution in the disposition of the man thus: the favourable impression of 
Christianity, of the doctrine, life and conduct of its adherents, which he had 
here and there received, especially on the occasion of the martyrdom of Stephen, 
threw his mind into a state of excitement and conflict, which he might indeed 
for a time forcibly repress, perhaps even by redoubled zeal against the new 
sect, but which must at last find vent in a decisive spiritual crisis, 
concerning which it need not surprise us that in an oriental it took the form of 
a Christophany. If according to this we have in the Apostle Paul an example, 
that strong impressions from the infant Christian community might carry an 
ardent mind that had long striven against it, to a pitch of exaltation which 
issued in a Christophany, and a total change of sentiment: surely the impression 
of the sublime personality of Jesus would suffice to inspire into his immediate 
disciples, struggling with the doubts concerning his messiahship which his death 
had excited in them, the experience of similar visions. They who think it 
necessary and desirable in relation to the Christophany of Paul </p>

<p>to call in the aid of external natural phenomena, as thunder and lightning, 
may also seek to facilitate the explanation of the appearances of the risen 
Jesus which his immediate disciples believed themselves to have previously had, 
by the supposition of similar incidents.<sup>* </sup>Only it must be observed 
that, as Eichhorn’s explanation of the event in the life of Paul proved a 
failure from his maintaining as historical every single detail in the New 
Testament narrative, as the blindness of Paul and his cure, the vision of 
Ananias, and so on, which he could only transform into natural occurrences by a 
very strained interpretation : so it would inevitably render impossible the 
psychological explanation of the appearances of Jesus, to acknowledge as 
historical all the evangelical narratives concerning them, especially those of 
the tests which Thomas applied by touching the wounds of Jesus, and which Jesus 
himself afforded by taking material nourishment; and indeed these narratives, 
from the contradiction which they are shown to present, have not the slightest 
claim to such a character. The two first gospels, and our chief informant in 
this matter, the Apostle Paul, tell us nothing of such tests, and it is quite 
natural that the Christophanies which, in the actual experience of the women and 
Apostles, may have floated before them as visions of much the same character as 
that which Paul had on the way to Damascus, when once received into tradition, 
should by reason of the apologetic effort to cut off all doubts as to their 
reality, be continually more and more consolidated so that the mute appearances 
became speaking ones, the ghostlike form was exchanged for one that ate, and the 
merely visible body was made palpable also.</p>
<p>Here however there presents itself a distinction, which seems at once to 
render the event in the history of Paul unavailable for the explanation of those 
earlier appearances. To the Apostle Paul, namely, the idea that Jesus had risen 
and appeared to many persons was delivered as the belief of the sect which he 
persecuted; he had only to receive it into his conviction and to vivify it in 
his imagination until it became a part of his own experience: the earlier 
disciples, on the contrary, had before them as a fact merely the death of their 
Messiah,—the notion of a resurrection on his part they could nowhere gather, but 
must, according to our conception of the matter, have first produced it; a 
problem which appears to be beyond all comparison more difficult than that 
subsequently presented to the Apostle Paul. In order to form a correct judgment 
on this subject, we must transport ourselves yet more completely into the 
situation and frame of mind into which the disciples of Jesus were thrown by his 
death. During several years’ intercourse with them he had constantly impressed 
them more and more decidedly with the belief that he was the Messiah; but his 
death, which they were unable to reconcile with their messianic ideas, had for 
the moment annihilated this belief. Now when, after the first shock was past, 
the earlier </p>
<p>* This is done in the treatise in Schmidt’s Bibliothek, and by Kaiser, ut 
sup.</p>
<p align="center">850</p>
<p>impression began to revive: there spontaneously arose in them the 
psychological necessity of solving the contradiction between the ultimate fate 
of Jesus and their earlier opinion of him — of adopting into their idea of the 
Messiah the characteristics of suffering and death. As, however, with the Jews 
of that age to comprehend meant nothing else than to derive from the sacred 
scriptures: they turned to these, to ascertain whether they might not perhaps 
find in them intimations of a suffering and dying Messiah. Foreign as the idea 
of such a Messiah is to the Old Testament, the disciples, who wished to find it 
there, must nevertheless have regarded as intimations of this kind, all those 
poetical and prophetic passages which, like isa. liii., Ps. xxii., represented 
the man of God as afflicted and bowed down even to death. Thus Luke states as 
the chief occupation of the risen Jesus in his interview with the disciples, 
that <i>beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all 
the scriptures the things concerning himself, </i>i. e. that <i>Christ ought to 
have suffered such things </i>(xxiv. 26<i> </i>f., 44 ff.). When they had in 
this manner received into their messianic idea ignominy, suffering and death, 
the ignominiously executed Jesus was not lost, but still remained to them: by 
his death he had only entered into his messianic glory (Luke xxiv. 26) in which 
he was invisibly <i>with them always, even unto the end of the world </i>(Matt. 
xxviii. 20). But how could he fail, out of this glory, in which he lived, to 
give tidings of himself to his followers? and how could they, when their mind 
was opened to the hitherto hidden doctrine of a dying Messiah contained in the 
scriptures, and when in moments of unwonted inspiration their <i>hearts burned 
within them </i>(Luke xxiv. 32),—how could they avoid conceiving this to be an 
influence shed on them by their glorified Christ, an opening of their 
understanding by him (v. 45<i>), </i>nay, an actual conversing with him ? * 
Lastly, how conceivable is it that in individuals, especially women, these 
impressions were heightened, in a purely subjective manner, into actual vision; 
that on others, even on whole assemblies, something or other of an objective 
nature, visible or audible, sometimes perhaps the sight of an unknown person, 
created the impression of a revelation or appearance of Jesus: a height of pious 
enthusiasm which is wont to appear elsewhere in religious societies peculiarly 
oppressed and persecuted. But if the crucified Messiah had truly entered into 
the <i>highest </i>form of blessed existence, he ought not to have left his body 
in the grave: and if in precisely such Old Testament passages as admitted of a 
typical relation to the sufferings of the Messiah, there was at the same time 
expressed the hope : <i>thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou 
suffer thy holy one to see corruption </i>(Ps. xvi. 10;<i> </i>Acts ii. 27); 
while in Isa. liii. 10<i>, </i>he who had been represented as led to the 
slaughter and buried, was yet promised a prolongation of his days: what was more 
natural to the disciples than to reinstate their earlier Jewish ideas, which the 
death of Jesus had disturbed, </p>
<p>* Comp. Weisse, ut sup. p. 398 ff.</p>
<p align="center">851</p>
<p>namely, that <i>the Christ remaineth for ever </i>(John xii. 34), through the 
medium of an actual revivification of their dead master, and, as it was a 
messianic attribute one day to call the dead bodily from the grave, to imagine 
also as returning to life in the manner of a resurrection?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the body of Jesus was interred in a known place, and could 
there (so far as we are not at liberty to suppose a theft, or an accidental 
removal) be sought for and exhibited: it is difficult to conceive how the 
disciples in Jerusalem itself, and not quite two days after the interment, could 
believe and declare that Jesus was risen, without refuting themselves, or 
meeting with refutation from their adversaries, (to whom however they appear to 
have made the first disclosure as to the resurrection of their Messiah at 
Pentecost,) by ocular demonstration at the grave.<sup>* </sup>Now it is here 
that the narrative of the first gospel, which has been unjustly placed below the 
others, presents an explanatory and satisfactory indication. According to this 
gospel also the risen Jesus does indeed appear in Jerusalem, but only to the 
women, and so entirely as a mere preparation for a succeeding interview, nay, so 
superfluously, that we have already questioned the truth of this appearance, and 
pronounced it to be a later modification of the legend of the angelic 
appearance, which Matthew nevertheless also included in his narrative.<sup>†
</sup>The sole important appearance of Jesus after the resurrection occurs, 
according to Matthew, in Galilee, whither an angel, and Jesus himself on the 
last evening of his life and on the morning of the resurrection, most urgently 
directed his disciples, and where the fourth gospel also, in its appendix, 
places an appearance of the resuscitated Jesus. That the disciples, dispersed by 
their alarm, at the execution of their Messiah, should return to their home in 
Galilee, where they had no need, as in the metropolis of Judea, the seat of the 
enemies of their crucified Christ, to shut the doors <i>for fear of the Jews,
</i>was natural. Here was the place where they gradually began to breathe 
freely, and where their faith in Jesus, which had been temporarily depressed, 
might once more expand with its former vigour. But here also, where no body lay 
in the grave to contradict bold suppositions, might gradually be formed the idea 
of the resurrection of Jesus; and when this conviction had so elevated the 
courage and enthusiasm of his adherents that they ventured to proclaim it in the 
metropolis, it was no longer possible by the sight of the body of Jesus either 
to convict themselves, or to be convictcd by others.</p>
<p>According to the Acts, it is true, the disciples so early as on the next 
Pentecost, seven weeks after the death of Jesus, appeared in Jerusalem with the 
announcement of his resurrection, and were themselves already convinced of it on 
the second morning after his burial, by appearances which they witnessed. But 
how long will it yet be, </p>
<p>* Comp. Friedrich, in Eichhorn’s Biblioth. 7, s. 223.</p>
<p>† Comp. also Schmidt’s Biblioth. 2, s. 548.</p>
<p align="center">852</p>
<p>until the manner in which the author of the Acts places the first appearance 
of the disciples of Jesus with the announcement of the new doctrine, precisely 
on the festival of the announcement of the old law, be recognized as one which 
rests purely on dogmatical grounds; which is therefore historically worthless, 
and in no way binds us to assign so short a duration to that time of quiet 
preparation in Galilee? As regards the other statement—it might certainly 
require some time for the mental state of the disciples to become exalted in the 
degree necessary, before this or that individual amongst them could, purely as 
an operation of his own mind, make present to himself the risen Christ in a 
visionary manner; or before whole assemblies, in moments of highly wrought 
enthusiasm, could believe that they heard him in every impressive sound, or saw 
him in every striking appearance:</p>
<p>but it would nevertheless be conceived, that, as it was not possible that he 
should be held by the bonds of death (Acts ii. 24), he had passed only a short 
time in the grave. As to the more precise determination of this interval, if it 
be held an insufficient explanation, that the sacred number three would be the 
first to suggest itself; there is a further idea which might occur,—whether or 
not it be historical that Jesus was buried on the evening before a sabbath,— 
namely, that he only remained in the grave during the rest of the sabbath, and 
thus rose <i>on the morning after the sabbath </i><font FACE="Symbol">prwi prwth 
sabbatw </font>which by the known mode of reckoning might be reconciled with the 
round number of three days.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>When once the idea of a resurrection of Jesus had been formed in this manner, 
the great event could not be allowed to have happened so simply, but must be 
surrounded and embellished with all the pomp which the Jewish imagination 
furnished. The chief ornaments which stood at command for this purpose, were 
angels: hence these must open the grave of Jesus, must, after he had come forth 
from it, keep watch in the empty place, and deliver to the women, who (because 
without doubt women had had the first visions) must be the first to go to the 
grave, the tidings of what had happened. As it was Galilee where Jesus 
subsequently appeared to them, the journey of the disciples thither, which was 
nothing else than their return home, somewhat hastened by fear, was derived from 
the direction of an angel; nay, Jesus himself must already before his death, 
and, as Matthew too zealously adds, once more after the resurrection also, have 
enjoined this journey on the disciples. But the further these narratives were 
propagated by tradition, the more must the difference between the locality of 
the resurrection itself and the appearances of the risen one, be allowed to fall 
out of sight as inconvenient; and since the locality of the death and 
resurrection was not transferable, the appearances </p>
<p>* May the three days’ abode of Jonah in the whale have had any influence on 
this determination of time? or the passage in Hosea quoted above, § I II, note 
3? Thc former is indeed only placed in this connexion in one gospel, and the 
latter is nowhere used in the N.<i> </i>T.</p>
<p align="center">853</p>
<p>were gradually placed in the same locality as the resurrection,—in Jerusalem, 
which as the more brilliant theatre and the seat of the first Christian Church, 
was especially appropriate for them.*</p>
<p>* Compare with this explanation the one given by Weisse, in the 7th chapter 
of his work above quoted. He agrees with the above representation in regarding 
the death of Jesus as real, and the narratives of the grave being found empty as 
later fabrications; the point in which he diverges is that above mentioned—that 
in his view the appearances of the risen Jesus are not merely psychological and 
subjective, but objective magical facts.</p>
