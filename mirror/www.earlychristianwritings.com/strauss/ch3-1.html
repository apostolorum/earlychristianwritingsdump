<p><font size="4">RELATION OF JESUS TO THE IDEA OF A SUFFERING AND DYING 
MESSIAH; HIS DISCOURSES ON HIS DEATH, RESURRECTION, AND SECOND ADVENT.</font></p>
<p>§ 111. DID JESUS IN PRECISE TERMS PREDICT HIS PASSION AND DEATH ?</p>
<p>According to the gospels, Jesus more than once, and while the result was yet 
distant,* predicted to his disciples that sufferings and a violent death awaited 
him. Moreover, if we trust the synoptical accounts, he did not predict his fate 
merely in general terms, but specifically beforehand the place of his passion, 
namelt Jerusalem; the time, namely, the approaching passover; the persons from 
whom he would have to suffer, namely, the chief priests, scribes and Gentiles; 
the essential form of his passion, namely, crucifixion, in consequence of a 
judicial sentence; and even its accessory circumstances, namely, scourging, 
reviling, and spitting (Matt. xvi. 21, xvii. 12, 22 f:, xx. 17 ff., xxvi. 12 
with the parall., Luke xiii. 33). Between the synoptists and the author of the 
fourth gospel, there exists a threefold difference in relation to this subject. 
Firstly and chiefly, in the latter the predictions of Jesus do not appear so 
clear and intelligible, but are for the most part presented in obscure 
figurative discourses, concerning which the narrator himself confesses that the 
disciples understood them not until after the issue (ii. 22). In addition to a 
decided declaration that he will voluntarily lay down his life (x. 15 ff.), 
Jesus in this gospel is particularly fond of alluding </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>His predictions concerning particular circumstances of his passion, 
uttered shortly before its occurrence, in the last days days of his life, can 
only be considered farther on, in the history of those days.</p>
<p align="center">632</p>
<p>to his approaching death under the expressions <font FACE="Symbol">uyoun, 
uyousqai, </font><i>to lift up, to be lifted up, </i>in the application of which 
he seems to vacillate between his exaltation on the cross, and his exaltation to 
glory (iii. 14, viii. 28, xii. 32) ; he compares his approaching exaltation with 
that of the brazen serpent in the wilderness (iii. 14), as, in Matthew, he 
compares his fate with that of Jonah (xii. 40) ; on another occasion, he speaks 
of going away whither no man can follow him (vii. 33 ff., viii. 21 f.), as, in 
the synoptists, of a taking away of a bridegroom, which will plunge his friends 
into mourning (Matt. ix. 15 parall.), and of a cup, which he must drink, and 
which his disciples will find it hard to partake of with him (Matt. xx. 22 
parall. ). The two other differences are less marked, but are still observable. 
One of them is, that while in John the allusions to the violent death of Jesus 
run in an equal degree through the whole gospel; in the synoptists, the repeated 
and definite announcements of his death.are found only towards the end, partly 
immediately before, partly during, the last journey; in earlier chapters there 
occurs, with the exception of the obscure discourse on the sign of Jonah (which 
we shall soon see to be no prediction,of death), only the intimation of a 
removal (doubtless violent) of the bridegroom. The last difference is, that 
while according to the three first Evangelists, Jesus imparts those predictions 
(again with the single exception of the above intimation, Matt. ix. 15) only to 
the confidential circle of his disciples; in John, he utters them in the 
presence of the people, and even of his enemies.</p>
<p>In the critical investigation of these evangelical accounts, we shall proceed 
from the special to the general, in the following manner. First we shall ask : 
Is it credible that Jesus had a foreknowledge of so many particular features of 
the fate which awaited him? and next: Is even a general foreknowledge and 
prediction of his sufferings, on the part of Jesus, probable? in which inquiry, 
the difference between the representation of John and that of the synoptists, 
will necessarily come under our consideration.</p>
<p>There are two modes of explaining how Jesus could so precisely foreknow the 
particular circumstances of his passion and death; the one resting on a 
supernatural, the other on a natural basis. The former appears adequate to solve 
the problem by the simple position, that before the prophetic spirit, which 
dwelt in Jesus in the richest plenitude, his destiny must have lain unfolded 
from the beginning. As, however, Jesus himself, in his announcements of his 
sufferings, expressly appealed to the Old, Testament, the prophecies of which 
concerning him must be fulfilled in all points (Luke xviii. 31, comp. xxii. 37, 
xxiv. 25 ff ; Matt. xxvi. 54) : so the orthodox view ought not to despise this 
help, but must give to its explanation the modification, that Jesus continually 
occupied with the prophecies of the Old Testament, may have drawn those 
particularities out of them, by the aid of the spirit that dwelt within him.* 
According to this, </p>
<sup><b>
<p>* </b></sup>Comp.<i> </i>Olshausen, bibl. Comm., I, s. 528.</p>
<p align="center">633</p>
<p>while the knowledge of the time of his passion remains consigned to his 
prophetic presentiment, unless he be supposed to have calculated this out of 
Daniel, or some similar source; Jesus must have come to regard Jerusalem as the 
scene of his suffering and death, by contemplating the fate of earlier prophets 
as a type of his own, the Spirit telling him, that where so many prophets had 
suffered death, there, <i>à fortiori </i>must the Messiah also suffer (Luke 
xiii. 33) ; that his death would be the sequel of a formal sentence, he must 
have gathered from Isa. liii. 8, where a<i> judgment </i>[<i>Heb. letters</i>]
<b>mishpat</b><i> </i>is spoken of as impending over the servant of God, and 
from v. 12, where it is said that he was <i>numbered with the transgressors, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">en toiV anomoiV elogisqh </font>(comp. Luke xxii. 37) ; that 
his sentence would proceed from the rulers of his own people, he might perhaps 
have concluded from Ps. cxviii. 22, where the <i>builders, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">oikodomounteV</font><i> </i>who reject the corner-stone, 
are, according to apostolic interpretation (Acts iv. 11), the Jewish rulers; 
that he would be delivered to the Gentiles, he might infer from the fact, that 
in several plaintive psalms, which are susceptible qf a messianic 
interpretation, the persecuting parties are represented as [<i>Heb. letters</i>]
<b>resha‘iym</b>, i. e. heathens; that the precise manner of his death would be 
crucifixion, he might have deduced, partly from the type of the brazen serpent 
which was suspended on a pole, Num. xxi. 8 f. (comp. John iii. 14), partly from 
the piercing of the hands and feet, Ps. xxii. 17, LXX. ; lastly, that he would 
be the object of scorn and personal maltreatment, he might have concluded from 
passages such as v. 7 ff. in the Psalm above quoted, Isa. l. 6, etc. Now if the 
spirit which dwelt in Jesus, and which, according to the orthodox opinion, 
revealed to him the reference of these prophecies and types to his ultimate 
destiny, was a spirit of truth : this reference to Jesus must admit of being 
proved to be the true and original sense of those Old Testament passages. But, 
to confine ourselves to the principal passages only, a profound grammatical and 
historical exposition has convincingly shown, for all who are in a condition to 
liberate themselves from dogmatic presuppositions, that in none of these is 
there any allusion to the sufferings of Christ. Instead of this, Isa. l. 6, 
speaks of the ill usage which the prophets had to experience;<sup>* </sup>Isa. 
liii. of the calamities of the prophetic order, or more probably of the 
Israelitish people ;† Ps. cxviii. of the unexpected deliverance and exaltation 
of that people, or of one of their princes ;<sup>‡ </sup>while Ps. xxii. is the 
complaint of an oppressed exile.<sup>§ </sup>As to the 17th verse of this Psalm, 
which has been interpreted as having reference to the crucifixion of Christ, 
even presupposing the most improbable interpretation of [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>
k’ry</b> by <i>perfoderunt, </i>this must in no case be understood literally, 
but only figuratively, and the image would be derived, not from a crucifixion,</p>
<sup>

<p>† Gesenius, ut sup. s. 158 ff. ; Hitzig, s. 577 ff. ; Vatke, bibl. Theol. I, 
s. 528 ff.</p>

<p>§ Ibid. s. 224 ff.</p>
<p align="center">634</p>
<p>but from a chase, or a combat with wild beasts .<sup>* </sup>hence the 
application of this passage to Christ is now only maintained by those with whom 
it would be lost labour to contend. According to the orthodox view, however, 
Jesus, in a supernatural manner, by means of his higher nature, discovered in 
these passages a pre-intimation of the particular features of his passion; but, 
in that case, since such is not the true sense of these passages, the spirit 
that dwelt in Jesus cannot have been the spirit of truth, but a lying spirit. 
Thus the orthodox expositor, so far as he does not exclude himself from the 
light dispensed by an unprejudiced interpretation of the Old Testament, is 
driven, for the sake of his own interest, to adopt the natural opinion; namely, 
that Jesus was led to such an interpretation of Old Testament passages, not by 
divine inspiration, but by a combination of his own.</p>
<p>According to this opinion,<sup>† </sup>there was no difficulty in foreseeing 
that it would be the ruling sacerdotal party to which Jesus must succumb, since, 
on the one hand, it was pre-eminently embittered against Jesus, on the other, it 
was in possession of the necessary power; and equally obvious was it that they 
would make Jerusalem the theatre of his judgment and execution, since this was 
the centre of their strength; that after being sentenced by the rulers of his 
people, he would be delivered to the Romans for execution, followed from the 
limitation of the Jewish judicial power at that period; that crucifixion was the 
death to which he would be sentenced, might be conjectured from the fact that 
with the Romans this species of death was a customary infliction, especially on 
rebels; lastly, that scourging and reviling would not be wanting, might likewise 
be inferred from Roman custom, and the barbarity of judicial proceedings in that 
age. But viewing the subject more nearly, how could Jesus so certainly know that 
Herod, who had directed a threatening attention to his movements (Luke xiii. 3 I 
), would not forestall the sacerdotal party, and add to the murder of the 
Baptist, that of his more important follower? And even if he felt himself 
warranted in believing that real danger threatened him from the side of the 
hierarchy only (Luke xiii. 33) ; what was his guarantee that one of their 
tumultuary attempts to murder him would not at last succeed (comp. John viii. 
39, x. 31), and that he would not, as Stephen did at a later period, without any 
further formalities, and without a previous delivery to the Romans, find his 
death in quite another manner than by the Roman punishment of crucifixion ? 
Lastly, how could he so confidently assert that the very next plot of his 
enemies, after so many failures, would be successful, and that the very next 
journey to the passover would be his last? —But the natural explanation also can 
call to its aid the Old Testament passages, and say: Jesus, whether by the 
application of a mode of interpretation then current among his countrymen, or 
under the guidance of his own individual views, </p>
<p>* Paulus, exeg. Handb. 3, b, s. 677 ff., and De Wette in loc.</p>
<p>† See this view developed by Fritzsche, Comm. in Marc., p. 381 f.</p>
<p align="center">635</p>
<p>gathered from the passages already quoted, a precise idea of the 
circumstances attendant on the violent end which awaited him as the Messiah.* 
But if in the first place it would be difficult to prove, that already in the 
lifetime of Jesus all these various passages were referred to the Messiah; and 
if it be equally difficult to conceive that Jesus could independently, prior to 
the issue, discover such a reference; so it would be a case undistinguishable 
from a miracle, if the result had actually corresponded to so false an 
interpretation; moreover, the Old Testament oracles and types will not suffice 
to explain all the particular features in the predictions of Jesus, especially 
the precise determination of time.</p>
<p>If then Jesus cannot have had so precise a foreknowledge of the circumstances 
of his passion and death, either in a supernatural or a natural way: he cannot 
have had such a foreknowledge at all: and the minute predictions which the 
Evangelists put into his mouth must be regarded as a <i>vaticinium post eventum.</i>† 
Commentators who have arrived at this conclusion, have not failed to extol the 
account of John, in opposition to that of the synoptists, on the ground that 
precisely those traits in the predictions of Jesus which, from their special 
character, he cannot have uttered, are only found in the synoptists, while John 
attributes to Jesus no more than indefinite intimations, and distinguishes these 
from his own interpretation, made after the issue; a plain proof that in his 
gospel alone we have the discourses of Jesus unfalsified, and in their original 
form.‡ But, regarded more nearly, the case does not stand so that the fourth 
Evangelist can only be taxed with putting an erroneous interpretation on the 
otherwise unfalsified declarations of Jesus : for in one passage, at least, he 
has put into his mouth an expression which, obscurely, it is true, but still 
unmistakably, determines the manner of his death as crucifixion; and 
consequently, he has here altered the words of Jesus to correspond with the 
result. We refer to the expression <font FACE="Symbol">uywqhnai,</font><i> to be 
lifted up: </i>in those passages of the fourth gospel where Jesus speaks in a 
passive sense of the Son of Man being lifted up, this expression might possibly 
mean his exaltation to glory, although in iii. 14, from the comparison with the 
serpent in the wilderness, which was well known to have been elevated on a pole, 
even this becomes a difficulty; but when, as in viii. 28, he represents the 
exaltation of the Son of Man as the act of his enemies (<font FACE="Symbol">otan 
uywshte ton uion t. a.</font>), it is obvious that these could not lift him up 
immediately to glory, but only to the cross; consequently, if the result above 
stated be admitted as valid, John must himself have framed this expression, or 
at least have distorted the Aramaean words of Jesus, and hence he essentially 
falls under the same category with the synoptical writers. That the fourth 
Evangelist, though </p>
<p>* Vid. Fritzsche, ut sup.</p>
<p>† Paulus, exeg. Handb. 2, s. 415 Ff. ; Ammon, bibl. Theol. 2, s. 377 f. ; 
Kaiser, bibl. Theol. I, s. 246. Fritzsche also, ut sup. and Weisse, I, s. 423, 
partly admit this.</p>

Evang. Johannis, s. 271 f.</p>
<p align="center">636</p>
<p>the passion and death of Jesus were to him past events, and therefore clearly 
present to his mind, nevertheless makes Jesus predict them in obscure 
expressions, —this has its foundation in the entire manner of this writer whose 
fondness for the enigmatical and mysterious here happily met the requirement, to 
give an unintelligible form to prophecies which were not understood.</p>
<p>There were sufficient inducements for the Christian legend thus to put into 
the mouth of Jesus, after the event, a prediction of the particular features of 
his passion, especially of the ignominious crucifixion. The more the Christ 
crucified became <i>to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness</i> 
(I Cor. i. 23), the more need was there to remove this offence by every possible 
means; and as, among subsequent events, the resurrection especially served as a
<i>retrospective </i>cancelling of that shameful death; so it must have been 
earnestly desired to take the sting from that offensive catastrophe <i>
beforehand </i>also, and this could not be done more effectually than by such a 
minute prediction. For as the most unimportant fact, when prophetically 
announced, gains importance, by thus being made a link in the chain of a higher 
knowledge: so the most ignominious fate, when it is predicted as part of a 
divine plan of salvation, ceases to be ignominious; above all, when the very 
person over whom such a fate impends, also possesses the prophetic spirit, which 
enables him to foresee and foretell it, and thus not only suffers, but 
participates in the divine prescience of his sufferings, he manifests himself as 
the <i>ideal </i>power over those suffering. But the fourth Evangelist has gone 
still farther on this track; he believes it due to the honour of Jesus to 
represent him as also the <i>real </i>power over his sufferings, as not having 
his life taken away by the violence of others, but as resigning it voluntarily 
(x. 17 f.) : a representation which indeed already finds some countenance in 
Matt. xxvi. 53, where Jesus asserts the possibility of praying to the Father for 
legions of angels, in order to avert his sufferings.</p>
<p>§ 112. THE PREDICTIONS OF JESUS CONCERNING HIS DEATH IN GENERAL; THEIR 
RELATION TO THE JEWISH IDEA OF THE MESSIAH: DECLARATIONS OF JESUS CONCERNING THE 
OBJECT AND EFFECTS OF HIS DEATH.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If in this manner we subtract from the declarations of Jesus 
concerning his approaching fate, attributed to him in the gospels, all which 
regards the particular circumstances of this catastrophe; there still remains on 
the part of Jesus the general announcement, that suffering and death awaited 
him, and also that this part of his career was a fulfilment of the Old Testament 
prophecies relative to the Messiah. As, however, the principal passages cited 
from the Old Testament, which treat of suffering and death, are only by mistake 
referred to the Messiah, while others, as Dan. ix. 26 ; Zech. xii. 10, </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">637</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">have not this signification:* the orthodox, above all, must 
again beware of attributing so false an interpretation of these prophecies, to 
the supernatural principle in Jesus. That instead of this, Jesus might possibly, 
by a purely natural combination, have educed the general result, that since he 
had made the hierarchy of his nation his implacable enemies, he had, in so far 
as he was resolved not to swerve from the path of his destination, the worst to 
fear from their revenge and authority (John x. 11 ff. ) ; that from the fate of 
former prophets (Matt. v. 12, xxi. 33 ff ; Luke xiii. 33 f.), and isolated 
passages bearing such an interpretation, he might prognosticate a similar end to 
his own career, and accordingly predict to his followers that earlier or later a 
violent death awaited him—this it would be a needless overstraining of the 
supranaturalistic view any longer to deny, and the rational mode of considering 
the subject should be admitted.† </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p>It may appear surprising if, after this admission, we still put the question, 
whether, according to the New Testament representation, it be probable that 
Jesus <i>actually </i>uttered such a prediction ? since, certainly, a general 
announcement of his violent death is the least which the evangelical accounts 
appear to contain, but our meaning in the question is this: is the sequel, 
especially the conduct of the disciples, so described in the gospels, as to be 
reconcilable with a prior disclosure of Jesus relative to the sufferings which 
awaited him? Now the express statements of the Evangelists do not merely tend to 
show that the disciples did not understand the discourses of Jesus on his coming 
death, in the sense that they did not know how to adjust these facts in their 
own minds, or to make them tally with their preconceived ideas concerning the 
Messiah, —a difficulty which drew from Peter the first time that Jesus announced 
his death, the exclamation: <i>Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto
</i>thee; —for we find the words of Mark (ix. 32 ), <i>But they understood not 
that saying, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oi de hgnooun to rhma,</font> thus 
amplified in Luke: <i>and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">kai hn parakekalummenon ap</font>’<font FACE="Symbol">autwn 
ina mh aisqwntai auto </font>(ix. 45) ; and the latter Evangelist on another

fall upon them as a blow for which they are entirely unprepared, and 
consequently annihilate all the hopes which they had fixed on him as the Messiah

<i>
<p>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel</i>). 
But had Jesus spoken of his death to the disciples with such perfect <i>openness</i> 
(<font FACE="Symbol">parrhsia,</font> Mark viii. 32), they must necessarily have 
understood his clear words and detailed discourses, and had he besides shown 
them that his death was foreshadowed in the messianic prophecies of the Old 
Testament, and was consequently a part of the Messiah’s destination (Luke xviii. 
31, xxii. 37), they could not, when his death actually ensued, have so entirely 
lost all belief in his messiahship. It is true that the Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist 
is wrong in his attempt to show in the conduct of Jesus, as described by the 
Evangelists, indications that his death was unexpected even to himself; but, 
looking merely at the conduct of the disciples, it is difficult to avoid the 
conclusion which that writer draws, namely, that to judge by that conduct, Jesus 
cannot have made any antecedent disclosure to his disciples concerning his 
death; on the contrary, they appear to the very last moment to have held the 
common opinion on this matter, and only to have adopted the characteristics of 
suffering and death into their conception of the Messiah, after the death of 
Jesus had unexpectedly come upon them.* At all events we have before us the 
following dilemma: either the statements of the Evangelists as to the inability 
of the disciples to understand the predictions of Jesus, and their surprise at 
his death, are unhistorically exaggerated ; or the decided declarations of Jesus 
concerning the death which awaited him, were composed <i>ex eventu, </i>nay, it 
becomes doubtful whether he even in general predicted his death as a part of his 
messianic destiny. On both sides, the legend might be led into unhistorical 
representations. For the fabrication of a prediction of his death in general, 
there were the same reasons which we have above shown to be an adequate motive 
for attributing to him a prognostication of the particular features of his 
passion: to the fiction of so total a want of comprehension in the disciples, an 
inducement might be found, on the one hand, in the desire to exhibit the 
profound mystery of a suffering Messiah revealed by Jesus, through the inability 
of the disciples to understand it; on the other, in the fact that in the 
evangelical tradition the disciples were likened to unconverted Jews and 
heathens, to whom anything was more intelligible than the death of the Messiah.</p>
<p>In order to decide between these alternatives, we must first examine whether, 
prior to the death of Jesus, and independently of that event, the messianic 
ideas of the age included the characteristics of suffering and death. If already 
in the lifetime of Jesus it was the Jewish opinion that the Messiah must die a 
violent death, then it is highly probable that Jesus imbibed this idea as a part 
of his convictions, and communicated it to his disciples; who, in that case, 
could so much the less have remained uninstructed on this point, and overwhelmed 
by the actual result, in the degree alleged </p>
<p>* Vom Zweck Jesu und seiner Junger, s. 114 ff. 153 f.</p>
<p align="center">639</p>
<p>by the Evangelists. If, on the contrary, that idea was not diffused among his 
countrymen before the death of Jesus, it still remains possible that Jesus might 
arrive at that idea by his private reflection; but it is a prior possibility 
that the disciples were the first to adopt the characteristics of suffering and 
death into their conception of the Messiah, after they had been taught by the 
issue.</p>
<p>The question whether the idea of a suffering and dying Messiah was already 
diffused among the Jews in the time of Jesus, is one of the most difficult 
points of discussion among theologians, and one concerning which they are the 
least agreed. And the difficulty of the question does not lie in the interests 
of party, so that it might be hoped that with the rise of impartial 
investigation, the subject would cease to be perplexed; for, as Stäudlin has 
aptly shown,* both the orthodox and the rationalistic interest may alternately 
tend in each direction, and we in fact find theologians of both parties on both 
sides.† The difficulty lies in the deficiency of information, and in the 
uncertainty of that which we do possess. If the Old Testament contained the 
doctrine of a suffering and dying Messiah, it might certainly thence be inferred 
with more than mere probability, that this doctrine existed among the Jews in 
the time of Jesus: as, however, according to the most recent researches, the Old 
Testament, while it does indeed contain the doctrine of an expiation of the sins 
of the people to take place at the messianic era (Ezek. xxxvi. 25, xxxvii. 23; 
Zech. xiii. 1; Dan. ix. 24), has no trace of this expiation being effected by 
the suffering and death of the Messiah:<sup>‡ </sup>there is no decision of the 
question before us to be expected from this quarter. The apocryphal books of the 
Old Testament lie nearer to the time of Jesus ; but as these are altogether 
silent concerning the Messiah in general,§ there can be no discussion as to 
their containing that special feature. Again, if we turn to Philo and Josephus, 
the two authors who wrote soonest after the period in question, we find the 
latter silent as to the messianic hopes of his nation ;|| and though the former 
does indeed speak of messianic times, and a messiah-like hero, he says nothing 
of sufferings on his part.<font SIZE="2"> <sup>¶</sup> </font>Thus there remain, 
as sources of information on this point, only the New Testament and the later 
Jewish writings.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, almost everything is calculated to give the impression, 
that a suffering and dying Messiah was unthought-of among the Jews who were 
contemporary with Jesus. To the majority of the Jews, we are told, the doctrine 
of a crucified </p>

<p>† See the list in De Wette, ut sup. s. 6 ff. The most important voices for 
the existence of the idea in question in the time of Jesus, have been noticed by

<p>Messiah was a <font FACE="Symbol">skandalon</font><i>, </i>and the disciples 
were at a loss to understand Jesus in his repeated and explicit announcements of 
his death. This does not look as if the doctrine of a suffering Messiah had been 
current among the Jews of that period; on the contrary, these circumstances 
accord fully with the declaration which the fourth Evangelist puts into the 
mouth of the Jewish <i>multitude, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ocloV</font> (xii. 
34), namely, that they had heard in the <i>law </i>(<font FACE="Symbol">nomoV</font>)
<i>that Christ abideth for ever </i><font FACE="Symbol">oti o CristoV menei eiV 
ton aiwna</font><i>.</i>* Indeed, for a general acceptation of the idea of a 
suffering Messiah among the Jews of that period, even those theologians who take 
the affirmative side in this argument do not contend;<i> </i>but, admitting that 
the hope of a worldly Messiah whose reign was to endure for ever, was the 
prevalent one, they only maintain (and herein the Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist 
agrees with them)† , that a less numerous party, — according to Stäudlin, the 
Essenes;<i> </i>according to Hengstenberg, the better and more enlightened part 
of the people in general—held the belief that the Messiah would appear in a 
humble guise, and only enter into glory through suffering and death. In support 
of this they appeal especially to two passages; one out of the third, and one 
out of the fourth gospel. When Jesus is presented as an infant in the temple at 
Jerusalem, the aged Simeon, among other prophecies, particularly concerning the 
opposition which her son would have to encounter, says to Mary: <i>Yea, a sword 
shall pierce through thine own soul also </i>(Luke ii. 35) ; words which seem to 
describe her maternal sorrow at the death of her son, and consequently to 
represent the opinion, that a violent death awaited the Messiah, as one already 
current before Christ. Still more plainly is the idea of a suffering Messiah 
contained in the words which the fourth gospel makes the Baptist utter on seeing 
Jesus : <i>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world </i>(i. 
29)! This, viewed in its relation to Isa. liii., would in the mouth of the 
Baptist likewise tend to prove, that the idea of expiatory suffering on the part 
of the Messiah was in existence before the time of Jesus. But both these 
passages have been above shown to be unhistorical, and from the fact that the 
primitive Christian legend was led, a considerable time after the issue, to 
attribute to persons whom it held divinely inspired, a foreknowledge of the 
divine decree with respect to the death of Jesus, it can by no means be 
concluded, that this insight really existed prior to the death of Jesus. In 
conclusion, it is urged, that at least the Evangelists and apostles refer to the 
idea of a suffering and dying Messiah in the Old Testament; whence it is thought 
warrantable to conclude, that this interpretation of the Old Testament passages 
connected with our present subject, was not unprecedented among the Jews. 
Certainly Peter (Acts iii. 18 f. ; I Pet. i. 11 f.) and Paul (Acts xxvi. 22 f. ; 
I Cor. xv. 3) appeal to Moses </p>
<p>* A passage to this effect out of the <i>law </i>(<font FACE="Symbol">nomoV</font>) 
properly so called, would be difficult to find: De Wette, de morte, p. 72, 
refers to Isa. ix. 5; Lücke, in loc. to Ps. cx. 4; Dan. vii. 14, ii. 44.</p>
<p>† Yom Zweck Jesu und seiner Jünger, s. 179 f.</p>
<p align="center">641</p>
<p>and the prophets as annunciators of the death of Jesus, and Philip, in his 
interview with the Ethiopian eunuch, interprets a passage in Isa. liii. of the 
sufferings of the Messiah: but as those teachers of the church spoke and wrote 
all this after the event, we have no assurance that they did not assign to 
certain Old Testament passages a relation to the sufferings of the Messiah, 
solely in consquence of that event, and not by adopting a mode of interpretation 
previously current among their Jewish cotemporaries.* </p>
<p>If, according to this, the opinion that the idea in question already existed 
among the countrymen of Jesus during his lifetime, has no solid foundation in 
the New Testament; we must proceed to inquire whether that idea may not be found 
in the later Jewish writings. Among the earliest writings of this class now 
extant, are the Chaldee paraphrases of Onkelos and Jonathan; and the <i>Targuml
</i>of the latter, who, according to rabbinical tradition, was a pupil of Hillel 
the elder,† is commonly cited as presenting the idea of a suffering Messiah, 
because it refers the passage, Isa. lii. 13-liii. 12, to the Messiah. But with 
respect to the interpretation of this passage in the <i>Targum of Jonathan, </i>
it is the singular fact, that while the prophecies which it contains are in 
general interpreted messianically, yet so often as suffering and death are 
spoken of, either these ideas are avoided with marked design, and for the most 
part by some extremely forced expedient, or are transferred to a different 
subject, namely, the people of Israel: a significant proof that to the author, 
suffering and violent death appeared irreconcilable with the idea of the 
Messiah.‡ But this, we are told, is the commencement of that aberration from the 
true sense of the sacred text, into which the later Jews were seduced by their 
carnal disposition, and their hostility to Christianity: the more ancient 
interpreters, it is said, discovered in this passage of Isaiah a suffering and 
dying Messiah. It is true that Abenezra, Abarbanel and others, testify that many 
ancient teachers referred Isa. liii. to the Messiah:§ but some of their 
statements leave it by no means clear that those more ancient </p>
<p>interpretations are not as partial as that of Jonathan; and in relation to

<p>all of them it remains uncertain, whether the interpreters of whom they speak 
reach as far back as the age of Jonathan, which is highly improbable with 
respect to those parts of the book <i>Sohar, </i>wherein the passage in question 
is referred to a suffering Messiah.* The writing which, together with that of 
Jonathan, may be regarded as the nearest to the time of Jesus, namely, the 
apocryphal fourth book of Esdras, drawn up, according to the most probable 
computation, shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus,† does 
indeed mention the death of the Messiah: not however as a painful one, but only 
as a death which, after the long duration of the messianic kingdom, was to 
precede the general resurrection.‡ The idea of great calamities, the 
birth-throes, as it were, of the Messiah ([<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>KhBLY HMShYKh</b>, 
comp. <font FACE="Symbol">arch wdinwn,</font> Matt. xxiv. 8), which would usher 
in the messianic times, was undoubtedly disseminated before Christ;<sup>§ </sup>
and equally early there appears to have been placed in the front of these ills, 
which were to press upon the people of Israel in particular, the <i>Antichrist,
</i><font FACE="Symbol">anticristoV,</font> whom the <i>Christ, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">CristoV</font>,<i> </i>would have to oppose ( 2 Thess. ii. 3 
ff. ) :<sup>|| </sup>but since he was to annihilate this adversary in a 
supernatural manner, <i>with the spirit of his mouth</i>, <font FACE="Symbol">tw 
pneumati tou stomatoV autou,</font> this involved no suffering for the Messiah. 
Nevertheless, there are to be found passages in which a suffering of the Messiah 
is spoken of, and in which this suffering is even represented as vicarious, on 
behalf of the people:<font SIZE="2"> ¶ </font>but first, this is only a 
suffering, and no death of the Messiah; secondly, it befalls him either before 
his descent into earthly life, in his pre-existence,* or during the concealment 
in which he keeps himself from his birth until his appearance as Messiah:<sup>†
</sup>lastly, the antiquity of these ideas is doubtful, and according to certain 
indications, they could only be dated after the destruction of the Jewish state 
by Titus.‡ Meanwhile, Jewish writings are by no means destitute of passages, in 
which it is directly asserted that a Messiah would perish in a violent manner: 
but these passages relate, not to the proper Messiah, the offspring of David, 
but to another, from among the posterity of Joseph and Ephraim, who was 
appointed to hold a subordinate position in relation to the former. This Messiah
<i>ben Joseph </i>was to precede the Messiah <i>ben David, </i>to unite the ten 
tribes of the former kingdom of Israel with the two tribes of the kingdom of 
Judah, but after this to perish by the sword in the battle with Gog and Magog: a 
catastrophe to which Zech. xii. 10 was referred.§ But of this second, dying 
Messiah, any certain traces are wanting </p>

extremely doubtful.* </p>
<p>Although, according to this, it cannot be proved, and is even not probable, 
that the idea of a suffering Messiah already existed among the Jews in the time 
of Jesus : it is still possible that, even without such a precedent, Jesus 
himself, by an observation of circumstances, and a comparison of them with Old 
Testament narratives and prophecies, might come to entertain the belief that 
suffering and death were a part of the office and destination of the Messiah; 
and if so, it would be more natural that he should embrace this conviction 
gradually in the course of his public ministry, and that he should chiefly have 
confined his communications on the subject to his intimate friends, than that he 
should have had this conviction from the beginning, and have expressed it before 
indifferent persons, nay enemies. The latter is the representation of John; the 
former, of the synoptists.*</p>
<p>In relation also to the declarations of Jesus concerning the object and 
effects of his death, we can, as above in relation to the announcement of the 
death itself, distinguish a more natural, from a more supranatural point of 
view. When Jesus in the fourth gospel likens himself to the true shepherd, who 
lays down his life for the sheep (x. 11, 15) : this may have the perfectly 
natural sense, that he is determined not to swerve from his office of shepherd 
and teacher, even though, in the prosecution of it, death should threaten him 
(the moral necessity of his death) ;<sup>† </sup>the foreboding expression in 
the same gospel (xii. 24), that <i>except a corn of wheat fall into the ground 
and die, it abideth alone, but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit, </i>
admits of an equally rational explanation, as a figurative representation of the 
victorious power which martyrdom gives to an idea and conviction (the moral 
efficacy of his death) ;<sup>‡ </sup>lastly, that which is so often repeated in 
the Gospel of John,—namely, that it is good for the disciples that Jesus should 
go away, for without his departure the <i>comforter, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
paraklhtoV</font> will not come to them, who will glorify him in them,—may be 
supposed to express the perfectly natural consideration of</p>
<p>Jesus, that without the removal of his sensible presence, the hitherto so 
material ideas of his disciples would not be spiritualized (the psychological 
efficacy of his death).§ The words of Jesus at the institution of the 
sacramental supper, belong more to the supranaturalistic mode of view. For if 
that which the intermediate Evangelists make him say on this occasion—that the 
cup presented is <i>the blood of the new testament, </i><font FACE="Symbol">to 
aima</font> <font FACE="Symbol">thV kainhV diaqhkhV </font>(Mark xiv. 24), and
<i>the new testament in his blood</i> <font FACE="Symbol">h kainh diaqhkh en tw</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">aimati autou</font><i> </i>(Luke xxii. 20),—might appear to 
signify no more than that, as by the bloody sacrifice at Sinai was </p>
<p>sealed the covenant of this ancient people with God, so by his (the 
Messiah’s) </p>
<p>* De Wette, de morte Chr., p. 112; comp. 53ff.</p>
<p>† Hase, L. J. § 108.</p>
<p>‡ Ibid.</p>
<p>§ Ibid. and § 109.</p>
<p align="center">644</p>
<p>blood would be sealed in a higher sense the community of the new covenant, 
gathering round him: in the account of Matthew, on the contrary, when he makes 
Jesus add, that his blood will be shed for many <i>for the remission of sins,
</i><font FACE="Symbol">eiV afesin</font> <font FACE="Symbol">amartiwn</font><i>,
</i>the idea of the covenant sacrifice is blended with that of expiatory 
sacrifice: and also in the two other Evangelists by the addition: <i>which is 
shed for many, </i>or <i>for you, </i><font FACE="Symbol">to peri pollwn, uper 
umwn</font> <font FACE="Symbol">ekcunomenon</font><i>, </i>the transition is 
made from the covenant sacrifice to the expiatory sacrifice. Further, when in 
the first gospel (xx. 28) Jesus says, he must <i>give his life a ransom for 
many, </i><font FACE="Symbol">dounai thn yuchn autou</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
lutron anti pollwn</font>, this is doubtless to be referred to Isa. liii., 
where, according to a notion current among the Hebrews (Isa. xliii. 3; Prov. 
xxi. 18), the death of the servant of God is supposed to have a propitiatory 
relation to the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>Thus Jesus might by psychological reflection come to the conviction that such 
a catastrophe would be favourable to the spiritual development of his disciples, 
and that it was indispensable for the spiritualizing of their messianic ideas, 
nay, in accordance with national conceptions, and by a consideration of Old 
Testament passages, even to the idea that his messianic death would have an 
expiatory efficacy. Still, what the synoptists make Jesus say of his death, as a 
sin offering, might especially appear to belong rather to the system which was 
developed after the death of Jesus ; and what the fourth Evangelist puts into 
his mouth concerning the Paraclete, to have been conceived <i>ex eventu: </i>so 
that, again, in these expressions of Jesus concerning the object of his death, 
there must be a separation of the general from the special.</p>
<p>§ 113. PRECISE DECLARATIONS OF JESUS CONCERNING HIS FUTURE RESURRECTION.</p>
<p>According to the evangelical accounts, Jesus predicted his resurrection in 
words not less clear than those in which he announced his death, and also fixed 
the time of its occurrence with singular precision. As often as he said to his 
disciples, the Son of Man will be crucified, he added: <i>And the third day he 
shall rise again, </i><font FACE="Symbol">kai th</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
trith hmera anasthsetai,</font> or <font FACE="Symbol">egerqhsetai, </font>
(Matt. xvi. 21, xvii. 23, xx. 19 parall. comp. xvii. 9, xxvi. 32 parall.).</p>
<p>But of this announcement also it is said, that the disciples understood it 
not; so little, that they even debated among themselves <i>what the rising from 
the dead should mean, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ti esti to ek nekrwn anasthnai</font> 
(Mark ix. 10): and in consistency with this want of comprehension, they, after 
the death of Jesus, exhibit no trace of a recollection that his resurrection had 
been foretold to them, no spark of hope that this prediction would be fulfilled. 
When the friends of Jesus had taken down his body from the cross, and laid it in 
the grave, they undertook (John xix. 40)—or the women reserved to </p>
<p align="center">645</p>
<p>themselves (Mark xvi. 1; Luke xxiii. 56)—the task of embalming him, which is 
only performed in the case of those who are regarded as the prey of corruption ; 
when, on the morning which, according to the mode of reckoning in the New 
Testament, opened the day which had been predetermined as that of the 
resurrection, the women went to the grave, they were so far from thinking of a 
predicted resurrection, that they were anxious about the probable difficulty of 
rolling away the stone from the grave (Mark xvi. 3) ; when Mary Magdalene, and 
afterwards Peter, found the grave empty, their first thought, had the 
resurrection been predicted, must have been, that it had now actually taken 
place : instead of this, the former conjectures that the body may have been 
stolen (John xx. 2), while Peter merely wonders, without coming to any definite 
conjecture (Luke xxiv. 12) ; when the women told the disciples of the angelic 
apparition which they had witnessed, and discharged the commission given them by 
the angel, the disciples partly regarded their words as <i>idle tales, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">lhroV</font><i>. </i>(Luke xxiv. 11), and were partly moved 
to fear and astonishment (<font FACE="Symbol">exesthsan</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">hmaV, </font>Luke xxiv. 22 ff.) ; when Mary Magdalene, and 
subsequently the disciples going to Emmaus, assured the eleven, that they had 
themselves seen the risen one, they met with no credence (Mark xvi. 11, 13), and 
Thomas still later did not believe even the assurance of his fellow-apostles 
(John xx. 25); lastly, when Jesus himself appeared to the disciples in Galilee, 
all of them did not even then cast off doubt (<font FACE="Symbol">oi de 
edistasan</font>, Mark xxviii. 17). All this we, must, with the Wolfenbüttel 
Fragmentist,* find inprehensible, if Jesus had so clearly and decidedly 
predicted his resurrection.</p>
<p>It is true, that as the conduct of the disciples, after the death of Jesus, 
speaks against such a prediction the part of Jesus, so the conduct of his 
disciples appears to speak for it. For when, accordmg to Matt. xxvii. 62 ff., 
the chief priests and Pharisees entreat Pilate to set a watch at the grave of 
Jesus, they allege as a reason for their request, that Jesus while still alive 
had said : <i>After three days I will rise again, </i><font FACE="Symbol">meta 
treiV hmeraV egeiromai</font>. But this narrative of the first gospel, which we 
can only estimate at a future point in our investigation, at present decides 
nothing, but only falls to one side of the dilemma, so that we must now say: if 
the disciples really so acted after the death of Jesus, then neither can he have 
decidedly foretold his resurrection, nor can the Jews in consideration of such a 
prediction have placed a watch at his grave; or, if the two latter statements be 
true, the disciples cannot have so acted.</p>
<p>It has been attempted to blunt the edge of this dilemma, by attributing to 
the above predictions, not the literal sense, that the deceased Jesus would 
return out of the grave, but only the figurative sense that his doctrine and 
cause, after having been apparently </p>

<p>crushed, would again expand and flourish.* As the Old Testament prophets, it 
was said, represent the restoration of the Israelitish people to renewed 
prosperity, under the image of a resurrection from the dead {Isa. xxvi. 19; 
Ezek. xxxvii.) ; as they mark the short interval within which, under certain 
conditions, this turn of things was to be expected, by the expression: in two or 
three days will Jehovah revive the smitten one, and raise the dead (Hos. vi. 2 
),† a statement of time which Jesus also uses indefinitely for a short interval 
(Luke xiii. 32) : so by the declaration that he will <i>rise on the third day 
after his death, </i><font FACE="Symbol">th trith hmera anasthnai</font><i>, </i>
he intends to say no more than that even though he may succumb to the power of 
his enemies and be put to death, still the work which he has begun will not come 
to an end, but will in a short time go forward with a fresh impetus. This merely 
figurative mode of speaking adopted by Jesus, the apostles, after Jesus had 
actually risen in the body, understood literally, and regarded them as 
prophecies of his personal resurrection. Now that in the prophetic passages 
adduced, the expressions [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>Qum khayah</b> and [<i>Heb. 
letters</i>] <b>Heqiyts</b> have only the alleged figurative sense, is true; but 
these are passages the whole tenor of which is figurative, and in which, in 
particular, the depression and death which precede the revivification are 
themselves to be understood only in a figurative sense. Here, on the contrary, 
all the foregoing expressions: <font FACE="Symbol">paradidosqai, katakrinesqai, 
staurousqai, apokteinesqai k. t. l. </font><i>(to be delivered, condemned, 
crucified, killed, </i>etc.) are to be understood literally; hence all at once, 
with the words <font FACE="Symbol">egerqhnai </font>and <font FACE="Symbol">
anasthnai,</font><i> </i>to enter on a figurative meaning, would be an 
unprecedented abruptness of transition; not to mention that passages such as 
Matt. xxvi. 32, where Jesus says: <i>After I am risen again I will go before you 
into Galilee, </i><font FACE="Symbol">meta to egerqhnai me proaxw umaV eiV thn 
Galilaian,</font><i>, </i>can have no meaning at all unless <font FACE="Symbol">
egeiresqai </font>be understood literally. In this closely consecutive series of 
expressions, which must be taken in a purely literal sense, there is then no 
warrant, and even no inducement, to understand the statement of time which is 
connected with them, otherwise than also literally, and in its strictly 
etymological meaning. Thus if Jesus really used these words, and in the same 
connexion in which they are given by the Evangelists, he cannot have meant to 
announce by them merely the speedy victory of his cause; his meaning must have 
been, that he himself would return to life in three days after his violent 
death.‡ </p>
<p>As however Jesus, judging from the conduct of his disciples after his death, 
cannot have announced his resurrection in plain words: other commentators have 
resigned themselves to the admission, that the Evangelists, after the issue, 
gave to the discourses of Jesus a </p>

<p>definiteness which, as uttered by him, they did not possess; that they have 
not merely understood literally, what Jesus intended figuratively, of the 
revival of his cause after his death, but in accordance with their erroneous 
interpretation, have so modified his words that, as we now read them, we must 
certainly understand them in a literal sense;* yet that not all the discourses 
of Jesus are altered in this manner ; here and there his original expressions 
still remain.</p>
<p>§ 114. FIGURATIVE DISCOURSES, IN WHICH JESUS IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANNOUNCED 
HIS RESURRECTION.</p>
<p>According to the fourth gospel, Jesus, at the very commencement of his 
ministry, in figurative language, referred his enemies, the Jews, to his future 
resurrection (ii. 19 ff. ). On his first messianic visit to Jerusalem, and when, 
after the abuse of the market in the temple had provoked him to that exhibition 
of holy zeal of which we have formerly spoken, the Jews require a sign from him, 
by which he should legitimatize his claim to be considered a messenger of God, 
who had authority to adopt such violent measures, Jesus gives them this answer,
<i>Destroy this temple, and after three days I will raise it up. </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">lusate ton naon touton, kai en</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
trisin hmeraiV egerw auton : </font>The Jews took these words in the sense, 
which, since they were spoken in the temple, was the most natural, and urged, in 
reply to Jesus, that as it had taken forty years to build this temple, he would 
scarcely be able, if it were destroyed, to rebuild it in three days; but the 
Evangelist informs us, that this was not the meaning of Jesus, and that he here 
spoke (though indeed the disciples were not aware of this until after his 
resurrection), of the <i>temple of his body, </i><font FACE="Symbol">naoV tou 
swmatoV autou </font>: i.e. under the destruction and rebuilding of the temple, 
he alluded to his death and resurrection. Even if we admit, what however the 
most moderate expositors deny,† that Jesus could properly (as he is also 
represented to have done in Matthew xii. 39 ff.) when the Jews asked him for a 
visible and immediate sign, refer them to his resurrection as the greatest, and 
for his enemies the most overwhelming miracle in his history: still he must have 
done this in terms which it was possible for them to understand (as in the above 
passage of Matthew, where he expresses himself quite plainly). But the 
expressions of Jesus, as here given, could not possibly be understood in this 
sense. For when one who is in the temple, speaks of the destruction of this 
temple, everyone will refer his words to the building itself. Hence Jesus, when 
he uttered the words, <i>this temple, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ton naon touton,</font><i>
</i>must have pointed to his body with his finger; as, indeed, is generally 
presupposed by the friends of this interpretation.‡ But, in the first place, the 
Evangelist says nothing of such a gesture, notwithstanding that it lay in </p>
<p>* Paulus, ut sup. 2, s. 415 ff. ; Hase, L. J. § 109.</p>
<p>† E.g. Lücke, I, s. 426; comp., on the contrary, Tholuck, in loc. </p>
<p>‡ Vid. Tholuck, ut sup.</p>
<p align="center">648</p>
<p>his interest to notice this, as a support of his interpretation. In the 
second place, Gabler has with justice remarked, how ill-judged and ineffective 
it would have been, by the addition of a mere gesture to give a totally new 
meaning to a speech, which verbally, and therefore logically, referred to the 
temple. If, however, Jesus used this expedient, the motion of his finger could 
not have been unobserved; the Jews must rather have demanded from him how he 
could be so arrogant as to call his body <i>the temple, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
naoV</font><i> </i>; or even if not so, still, presupposing that action, the 
disciples could not have remained in the dark concerning the meaning of his 
words, until after the resurrection.* </p>
<p>By these difficulties modern exegetists have felt constrained to renounce 
John’s explanation of the words of Jesus, as erroneous and made <i>ex eventu,
</i>and to attempt to penetrate, independently of the Evangelist’s explanation, 
into the sense of the enigmatical saying which he attributes to Jesus.† The 
construction put upon it by the Jews, who refer the words of Jesus to a real 
destruction and rebuilding of the national sanctuary, cannot be approved without 
imputing to Jesus an extravagant example of vain-glorious boasting, at variance 
with the character which he elsewhere exhibits. If on this account search be 
made for some figurative meaning which may possibly be assigned to the 
declaration, there presents itself first a passage in the same gospel (iv. 21 
ff.) where Jesus announces to the woman of Samaria, that the time is immediately 
coming, in which the Father will no longer be worshipped exclusively in 
Jerusalem (<font FACE="Symbol">en IerosolumoiV)</font><i>, </i>but will, as a 
Spirit, receive spiritual worship. Now in the present passage also, the 
destruction of the temple might, it is said, have signified the abolition of the 
temple-service at Jerusalem, supposed to be the only valid mode of worship, This 
interpretation is confirmed by a narrative in the Acts (vi. 14), Stephen, who, 
as it appears, had adopted the above expressions of Jesus, was taxed by his 
accusers with declaring, <i>that Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and 
shall change the customs which Moses delivered, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oti 
IhsouV o NazwraioV outoV katalusei ton topon touton,</font> <font FACE="Symbol">
kai allaxei ta eqh, a paredwke MwushV </font>: In which words a change of the 
Mosaic religious institutions, without doubt a spiritualization of them, is 
described as a sequel to the destruction of the temple. To this may be added a 
passage in the synoptical gospels. Nearly the same words which in John are 
uttered by Jesus himself, appear in the two first gospels (Matt. xxvi. 60 f. ; 
Mark xiv. 57 f,) as the accusation of false witnesses against him; and here 
Mark, in addition, designates the temple which is to be destroyed, as one <i>
made with hands, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ceiropoihtoV,</font><i> </i>and the new 
one which is to be </p>

<p>built, as <i>another, made without hands, </i><font FACE="Symbol">alloV,</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">aceiropoihtoV, </font>whereby he appears to indicate the 
same contrast between a ceremonial and a spiritual religious system. By the aid 
of these passages, it is thought, the declaration in John may be explained thus: 
the sign of my authority to purify the temple, is my ability in a short time to 
introduce in the place of the Jewish ceremonial worship, a spiritual service of 
God; i.e. I am authorized to reform the old system, in so far as I am qualified 
to found a new one. It is certainly a trivial objection to this explanation, 
that in John the object is not changed, as in Mark, where the temple which is to 
be built is spoken of as <i>another </i>(<font FACE="Symbol">alloV</font>),<i>
</i>but instead of this, is indicated by the word <font FACE="Symbol">autoV
</font><i>, </i>as the same with the one destroyed;<sup>* </sup>since, indeed, 
the Christian system of religion in relation to the Jewish, may, just as the 
risen bodyof Jesus in relation to the dead one, be conceived as at once 
identical and different, inasmuch as in both cases the substance is the same, 
while the transitory accidents only are supposed to be removed. But it is a more 
formidable objection which attaches itself to the determination of time,
<font FACE="Symbol">en trisin hmeraiV. </font>That this expression is also used 
indefinitely and proverbially, in the sense of a short interval of time in 
general, is not adequately proved by the two passages which are usually appealed 
to with this view; for in them the third day, by being placed in connexion with 
the second and first (Hos. vi. 2 : [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>Miyyomayim bayyom 
hashsheliyshiy</b>; Luke xiii. 32 : <font FACE="Symbol">shmeron kai aurion kai 
th trith </font>is announced as a merely relative and proximate statement, 
whereas in our passage it stands alone, and thus presents itself as an absolute 
and precise determination of time.† </p>
<p>Thus alike invited and repelled by both explanations,‡ theologians take 
refuge in a double sense which holds the middle place either between the 
interpretation of John and the symbolical one last stated,§ or between the 
interpretation of John and that of the Jews ;|| so that Jesus either spoke at 
once of his body which was to be killed and again restored to life, and of the 
modification of the Jewish religion which was to be effected, chiefly by means 
of that death and resurrection; or, in order to repel the Jews, he challenged 
them to destroy their real temple, and on this condition, never to be fulfilled, 
promised to build another, still, however, combining with this ostensible sense 
for the multitude, an esoteric sense, which was only understood by the disciples 
after the resurrection, and according to which <font FACE="Symbol">naoV</font><i>
</i>denoted his body. But such a challenge addressed to the Jews, together with 
the engagement appended to it, would have been an unbecoming manifestation of 
petulance, and the latent intimation to the disciples, a useless play on words; 
besides that, in general, a double meaning either of the one or the </p>

<p>other kind is unheard of in the discourse of a judicious man.* As, in this 
manner, the possibility of explaining the passage in John might be entirely 
despaired of, the author of the Probabilia appeals to the fact that the 
synoptists call the witnesses, who allege before the judgment seat that Jesus 
had uttered that declaration, <font FACE="Symbol">yeudomarturaV, </font><i>false 
witnesses; </i>whence he concludes, that Jesus never said what John here 
attributes to him, and thus gains an exemption from the explanation of the 
passage, since he regards it as a figment of the fourth Evangelist, whose object 
was both to explain the calumniations of the accusers, and also to nullify them 
by a mystical interpretation of his words.† But, on the one hand, it does not 
follow, from the fact that the synoptists call the witnesses false, that, in the 
opinion of the Evangelists, Jesus had never said anything whatever of that 
whereof they accused him; for he might only have said it somewhat differently (<font FACE="Symbol">lusate</font>, 
not <font FACE="Symbol">lusw</font>), or have intended it in a different sense 
(figuratively instead of literally) : on the other hand, if he said nothing at 
all of this kind, it is difficult to explain how the false witnesses should come 
to choose that declaration, and especially the remarkable phrase,
<font FACE="Symbol">en trisin hmeraiV.</p>
</font>
<p>If, according to this, on every interpretation of the expression, except the 
inadmissible one relative to the body of Jesus, the words <font FACE="Symbol">en 
trisin hmeraiV</font> form a difficulty: a resource might be found in the 
narrative of the Acts, as being free from that determination of time. For here 
Stephen is only accused of saying, <font FACE="Symbol">oti I. o Naz. outoV</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">katalusei ton topon touton (ton agion), kai allaxei ta eqh a 
paredwke MwushV. </font>What is <i>false </i>in this allegation (for the 
witnesses against Stephen also are described as <font FACE="Symbol">martureV 
yeudeiV</font><i> </i>might be the second proposition, which speaks in literal 
terms of a changing of the institutes of Moses, and instead of this, Stephen, 
and before him Jesus, may very probably have said in the figurative 
signification above developed, <font FACE="Symbol">kai palin</font> &#61472;<font FACE="Symbol">oikodomhsei 
(-sw) auton </font>or <font FACE="Symbol">kai allon (aceiropoihton) oikodomhsei 
(-sw).</font> </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, this expedient is not at all needful, so far as 
any insurmountable difficulty in the words <font FACE="Symbol">en trisin 
hmeraiV,</font><i> </i>is concerned. As the number 3 is used proverbially, not 
only in connexion with 2 or 4 (Prov. xxx. 15, 18, 21, 29 ; Wis. xxiii. 21, xxvi. 
25), but also by itself (Wis. xxv. 1, 3) ; so the expression, <i>in three days,
</i>if it were once, in combination with the second and first day, become common 
as an indefinite statement of time, might probably at length be applied in the 
same sense when standing alone. Whether the expression should signify a long or 
a short period would then depend on the connexion : here, in opposition to the 
construction of a great and elaborate building, to the real, natural erection of 
which, as the Jews directly remark, a long series of years was required, the 
expression can only be understood as denoting the shortest time.‡ </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A prediction, or even a mere intimation of the resurrection, 
is therefore not contained in these words.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As, here, Jesus is said to have intimated his resurrection 
beforehand, by the image of the destroying and rebuilding of the temple, so, on 
another occasion, he is supposed to have quoted the type of the prophet Jonah 
wIth the same intention (Matt. xii. 39 ff., comp. xvi. 4; Luke xi 29 ff.). When 
the scribes and Pharisees desired to see a sign from him, Jesus is said to have 
repulsed their demand by the reply, that to so evil a <i>generation ) </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">gene</font>a<i> </i>no sign shall be given, but <i>the sign 
of the prophet Jonah, </i><font FACE="Symbol">to shmeion Iwna tou profhtou,</font><i>
</i>which, in the first passage of Matthew, Jesus himself explains thus : as 
Jonah was three days and three nights <i>in the belly of the whale, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">en th koilia tou khtouV </font>so also the Son of man will 
pass three days and three nights in the <i>heart of the earth, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">en th kardia thV ghV. </font>In the second passage, in which 
Matthew attributes this declaration to Jesus, he does not repeat the above 
interpretation; while Luke, in the parallel passage, explains it simply thus :
<i>For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to 
this generation. </i>Now against the possibilityof Jesus having himself given 
the interpretation of the sign of Jonah which Matthew puts into his mouth, v. 
40, a variety of objections may be urged. It is indeed scarcely a tenable 
argument, that Jesus cannot have spoken of three days and three nights, which he 
would pass in the heart of the earth, because he only lay in the grave one day 
and two nights:* since the phraseology of the New Testament decidedly has the 
peculiarity of designating the abode of Jesus in the grave as of three days’ 
duration, because it touched upon the evening of the day before the Sabbath, and 
the morning of the day after it; and if this one day, together with two nights, 
were once taken for three whole days, it would only be a round way of expressing 
this completeness, to add to the days the nights also, which, besides, would 
naturally follow in the comparison with the three days and three nights of 
Jonah.† But if Jesus gave the explanation of the sign of Jonah which Matthew 
attributes to him, this would have been so clear a prediction of his 
resurrection, that for the same reasons which, according to the above 
observations, are opposed to the literal predictions of that event, we must 
conclude that Jesus cannot have given this explanation. At all events it must 
have led the disciples who, according to v. 49, were present, to question Jesus, 
and in that case it is not to be understood why he did not make the subject 
perfectly clear, and thus announce his resurrection in plain words. But if he 
cannot have done this, because then the disciples could not have acted after his 
death as they are said to have done in the evangelical accounts: neither can he, 
by that comparison of the fate which awaited him with that of Jonah, have called 
forth from his disciples a question, which, if proposed to him, he must have 
answered; but which, judging from the sequel, he cannot have answered.</p>

<p align="center">652</p>
<p>On these grounds, modern critics have pronounced the explanation of the
<font FACE="Symbol">shmeion Iwna </font>in Matthew to be an interpretation made
<i>post eventum </i>by the Evangelist, and by him falsely attributed to Jesus.* 
According to them,</p>
<p>Jesus indeed directed the attention of the Pharisees to the <i>sign of Jonah,
</i>but only in the sense in which Luke makes him explain it: namely, that as 
Jonah himself, by his mere appearance and preaching of repentance, without 
miracles, had sufficed as a sign from God to the Ninevites; so his own 
cotemporaries, instead of craving for miracles, should be satisfied with his 
person and preaching. This interpretation is the only one which accords with the 
tenor of the discourse of Jesus—even in Matthew, and more particularly with the 
parallel between the relation of the Ninevites to Jonah, and that of the queen 
of the south to Solomon. As it was the <i>wisdom of Solomon, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">sofia SolomwnoV</font>, by which the latter felt herself 
attracted from the ends of the earth: so, in</p>
<p>Jonah, even according to the expression of Matthew, it was solely his <i>
preaching</i><font FACE="Symbol"> khrugma</font><i>, </i>which brought the 
Ninevites to repentance. It might be supposed that the future tense in Luke:
<font FACE="Symbol">outwV estai kai o uioV t. a.</font> <font FACE="Symbol">th 
genea tauth (shmeion)</font><i>, So shall also the Son of Man be to this 
generation (a sign), </i>cannot be referred to Jesus and his preaching as 
manifested at that moment, but only to something future, as his resurrection: 
but this in reality points either to the future <i>judgment </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">krisiV</font><i>, </i>in which it will be made manifest, 
that as Jonah was reckoned a sign to the Ninevites, so was the Son of Man to the 
Jews then living; or to the fact that when Jesus spoke these words, his 
appearance had not yet attained its consummation, and many of its stages lay yet 
in futurity. Nevertheless, it must have been at an early period, as we see from 
the first gospel, that the fate of Jonah was placed in a typical relation to the 
death and resurrection of Jesus, since the primitive church anxiously searched 
through the Old Testament for types and prophecies of the offensive catastrophe 
which befel their Messiah.</p>
<p>There are still some expressions of Jesus in the fourth gospel, which have 
been understood as latent prophecies of the resurrection. The discourse on the
<i>corn of wheat, </i>xii. 24, it is true, too obviously relates to the work of 
Jesus as likely to be furthered by his death, to be here taken into further 
consideration. But in the farewell discourses in John there are some 
declarations, which many are still inclined to refer to the resurrection. When 
Jesus says : <i>I will not leave you comfortless, I will come unto you;</i> <i>
yet a little time, and the world sees me no more, but ye see me</i>, <i>a little 
while, and ye shall not see me, and again a little while and ye shall see me,
</i>etc. (xiv. 18 ff., xvi. 16 ff.) ; many believe that these expressions—with 
the relation between <font FACE="Symbol">mikron kai palin mikron</font><i>, a 
little while, and again a little while; </i>the opposition between
<font FACE="Symbol">emfanizein hmin (toiV maqhtaiV) kai ouci</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">tw kosmw</font><i>, manifest to you (the disciples) and not 
to the world; </i>the words <font FACE="Symbol">palin oyomai </font>and<font FACE="Symbol"> 
oyesqe</font><i>,</p>
</i>
<p>* Paulus, exeg. Handb. 2, s. 97 ff. Schulz, über das Abendm., s. 317 f.</p>
<p align="center">653</p>
<i>
<p>I shall see you again, and ye shall see, </i>which appear to indicate a 
strictly personal interview—can be referred to nothing else than the 
resurrection, which was precisely such a reappearance after a short removal, and 
moreover a personal reappearance granted to the friends of Jesus alone.* But 
this promised reappearance is at the same time described by Jesus in a manner 
which will not suit the days of the resurrection. If the words <i>because I 
live, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oti egw zw </font>(xiv. 19), denote his 
resurrection, we are at a loss to know what can be meant by the succeeding 
clause, <i>ye shall live also,</i><font FACE="Symbol"> kai umeiV zhsesqe</font><i>.
</i>Again, Jesus says that on that reappearance his disciples will know his 
relation to the Father, and will no more need to ask anything of him (xiv. 20, 
xvi. 23): yet even on the very last day of their intercourse with him after the 
resurrection, they ask a question of him (Acts i. 6), and one which from the 
point of view of the fourth gospel is altogether senseless. Lastly, when he 
promises that to him who loves him, he and the Father will come, and make their 
abode with him, it is perfectly clear that Jesus here speaks not of a corporeal 
return, but of his spiritual return, through the <font FACE="Symbol">paraklhtoV.</font>† 
Nevertheless, even this explanation has its difficulties, since, on the other 
hand, the expressions <i>ye shall see me, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oyesqe me</font><i>,
</i>and <i>I shall see you, </i><font FACE="Symbol">oyomai umaV</font><i>, </i>
will not entirely suit that purely spiritual return : hence we must defer the 
solution of this apparent contradiction until we can give a more complete 
elucidation of the discourses in which these expressions occur. In the meantime 
we merely observe, that the farewell discourses in John, being admitted, even by 
the friends of the fourth gospel, to contain an intermixture of the Evangelist’s 
own thoughts, are the last source from which to obtain a proof on this subject.</p>
<p>After all, there might seem to be a resource in the supposition, that though 
Jesus did not indeed speak of his future resurrection, it was not the less 
foreknown by him. Now if he had a foreknowledge of his resurrection, either he 
obtained it in a supernatural manner, by means of the prophetic spirit, the 
higher principle that dwelt within him—by means of his divine nature, if that be 
preferred: or he knew it in a natural manner, by the exercise of his human 
reason. But a supernatural foreknowledge of that event, as well as of his death, 
is inconceivable, owing to the relation in which Jesus places it to the Old 
Testament. Not merely in passages such as Luke xviii. 31 (which, as prophecies, 
can no longer have an historical value for us after the result of our last 
inquiry), does Jesus represent his resurrection, together with his passion and 
death, as a fulfilment of <i>all things that are written by the prophets 
concerning the Son of man</i> <font FACE="Symbol">pantwn twn gegrammenwn dia twn 
profhtwn tw</font> <font FACE="Symbol">uiw tou anqrwpou;</font> but even after 
the issue, he admonishes his disciples that they ought to believe <i>all that

<p>According to the sequel of the narrative, Jesus forthwith expounded to these 
disciples (going to Emmaus) all the passages of scripture relating to himself,
<i>beginning at Moses and all the prophets, </i><font FACE="Symbol">arxamenoV 
apo</font> <font FACE="Symbol">MwsewV kai apo pantwn twn profhtwn,</font><i> </i>
to which farther on (v. 44) the <i>psalms </i>are added; but no single passage 
is given us as having been interpreted by Jesus of his resurrection, except that 
it would follow from Matt. xii. 39 f., that he regarded the fate of the prophet 
Jonah as a type of his own; and regarding the subsequent apostolic 
interpretation as an echo of that of Jesus, it might be concluded, that he, as 
afterwards the apostles, found such prophecies chiefly in Ps. xvi. 8 ff. (Acts 
ii. 25 ff., xiii. 35) ; Isa. liii. (Acts viii. 32 ff.) ; Isa. lv. 3 (Acts xiii. 
34), and possibly also in Hos. vi. 2. But the fate of Jonah has not even an 
external similarity to that of Jesus ; and the book which narrates his history 
carries its object so completely in itself, that whoever may ascribe to it or to 
one of its particulars, a typical relation to events in futurity, assuredly 
mistakes its true sense and the design of its author. Isa. lv. 3 is so obviously 
irrelevant that one can scarcely conceive how the passage could be brought into 
special connexion with the resurrection of Jesus. Isa. liii. refers decidedly to 
a collective subject perpetually restored to life in new members. Hosea vi. has 
a figurative reference, not to be mistaken, to the people and state of Israel. 
Lastly, the principal passage, Ps. xvi. can only be interpreted of a pious man, 
who by the help of Jehovah hopes to escape from the danger of death, not in the 
sense that he, like Jesus, would rise again from the grave, but that he would 
not be laid there—that is, obviously, not for the present, and with the 
understanding, that when his time should come, he must pay the tribute of 
nature:* which, again, will not apply to Jesus. Thus if a supernatural principle 
in Jesus—a prophetic spirit—caused him to discover a pre-intimation of his 
resurrection in these Old Testament histories and passages; then, as no one of 
them really contained such a pre-intimation, the spirit in him cannot have been 
the spirit of truth, but must have been a lying spirit, the supernatural 
principle in him, not a divine, but a demoniacal principle. If, in order to 
avoid this consequence, supranaturalists who are accessible to a rational 
interpretation of the Old Testament, resort to their only remaining expedient, 
of regarding the foreknowledge of Jesus concerning his resurrection as purely 
natural and human: we must reply, that the resurrection, conceived as a miracle, 
was a secret of the divine counsels, to penetrate into which, prior to the 
issue, was an impossibility to a human intelligence; while viewed as a natural 
result, it was a chance the last to be calculated upon, apart from the 
supposition of an apparent death planned by Jesus and his colleagues.</p>
<p>Thus the foreknowledge, as well as the prediction of </p>
<p>* Vid. de Wette, Comm. über die Psalmen, s. 178.</p>
<p align="center">655</p>
<p>the resurrection, was attributed to Jesus only after the issue; and in fact, 
it was an easy matter, with the groundless arbitrariness of Jewish exegesis, for 
the disciples and the authors of the New Testament to discover in the Old, types 
and prophecies of the resurrection. Not that they did this with crafty design, 
according to the accusation of the Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist, and others of his 
class: but as he who has looked at the sun, long sees its image wherever he may 
turn his gaze; so they, blinded by their enthusiasm for the new Messiah, saw him 
on every page of the only book they read, the Old Testament, and in the 
conviction that Jesus was the Messiah, founded in the genuine feeling that he 
had satisfied their deepest need—a conviction and a feeling which we also still 
honour—they laid hold on supports which have long been broken, and which can no 
longer be made tenable by the most zealous efforts of an exegesis which is 
behind the age.</p>
<p>§ 115. THE DISCOURSES OF JESUS ON HIS SECOND ADVENT . CRITICISM OF THE 
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS.</p>
<p>Not only did Jesus, according to the evangelical accounts, predict that he 
should return to life three days after his death; but also that at a later 
period, in the midst of the calamities which would issue in the destruction of 
the temple in Jerusalem, he should come in the clouds of heaven, to close the 
present period of the world, and by a general judgment, open the future age 
(Matt. xxiv. and xxv. ; Mark. xiii. ; Luke xvii. 22-37, xxi. 5-36).</p>
<p>As Jesus for the last time went out of the temple (Luke has not this 
circumstance), and his disciples (Luke says indefinitely, <i>some) </i>
admiringly drew his attention to the magnificent building, he assured them that 
all which they then looked on, would be destroyed from its foundations (Matt. 
xxiv. I<b>, 2, </b>parall.). On the question of the disciples, when this would 
happen, and what would be the sign of the Messiah’s coming, which in their idea 
was associated with such a crisis (v. 3), Jesus warns them not to be deceived by 
persons falsely giving themselves out to be the Messiah, and by the notion that 
the expected catastrophe must follow immediately on the first prognostics; for 
wars and rumours of war, risings of nation against nation and kingdom against 
kingdom, famine, pestilence, and earthquakes in divers places, would be only the 
beginning of the sorrows which were to precede the advent of the Messiah (v. 
4—8). They themselves, his adherents, must first suffer hatred, persecution, and 
the sword; perfidy, treachery, deception by false prophets, lukewarmness and 
general corruption of morals, would prevail among men; but at the same time the 
news of the Messiah’s kingdom must be promulgated through the whole world. Only 
after all this, could the end of the present period of the world arrive, until 
when, he who would partake of the blessedness of the future must endure with </p>
<p align="center">656</p>
<p>constancy (v. 9—14). A nearer presage of this catastrophe would be the 
fulfilment of the oracle of Daniel (ix <b>27), </b>the standing of the 
abomination of desolation in the holy place (according to Luke xxi <b>20, </b>
the encompassing of Jerusalem with armies) When this should take place, it would 
be high time for the most precipitate flight (according to Luke, because the 
devastation of Jerusalem would be at hand, an event which he more nearly 
particularizes in the address of Jesus to the city, xix. 43 1.: <i>thine enemies 
shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on 
every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within 
thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another). </i>At this 
juncture, all who should have hindrances to rapid departure would be deserving 
of compassion, and it would be in the highest degree desirable that the 
recommended flight should not fall in an unfavourable season; for then would 
commence unexampled tribulation (according to Luke, v. <b>24, </b>consisting 
chiefly in many of the people of Israel perishing by the sword, in others being 
carried away captive, and in Jerusalem being trodden down of the Gentiles for a 
predetermined period): a tribulation which only the merciful abridgment of its 
duration by God, for the sake of the elect, could render supportable (v. <b>
15—22). </b>At this time would arise false prophets and Messiahs, seeking to 
delude by miracles and signs, and promising to show the Messiah in this or that 
place: whereas a Messiah who was concealed anywhere, and must be sought out, 
could not be the true one; for his advent would be like the lightning, a sudden 
and universal revelation, of which the central point would be Jerusalem, the 
object of punishment on account of its sin (v. <b>2 </b>3—28). Immediately after 
this time of tribulation, the darkening of the sun and moon, the falling of the 
stars, and the shaking of all the powers of heaven would usher in the appearance 
of the Messiah, who, to the dismay of the dwellers on the earth, would come with 
great glory in the clouds of heaven, and immediately send forth his angels to 
gather together his elect from all the corners of the earth (v. <b>29—3 1). </b>
By the fore-named signs the approach of the described catastrophe would be as 
certainly discernible as the approach of summer by the budding of the fig-tree; 
the existing generation would, by all that was true, live to witness it, though 
its more precise period was known to God only (v. 3<b>2—36). </b>But, after the 
usual manner of mankind (what follows, Mark and Luke partly have not at all, 
partly not in this connexion), they would allow the advent of the Messiah, as 
formerly the deluge, to overtake them in thoughtless security (v. 37—39): and 
yet <b>it </b>would be an extremely critical period, in which those who stood in 
the closest relation to each other, would be delivered over to entirely opposite 
destinies (v. 40, 41). Hence watchfulness would be requisite, as in all cases 
where the period of a decisive issue is uncertain: an admonition which is then 
illustrated by the image of the master of the house and the thief (v. 43, 44) ; 
of the servant to whom his lord, when about to travel, entrusted the rule </p>
<p align="center">657</p>
<p>of his house (v. 45—51); of the wise and foolish virgins (XXV. 1—13): and 
lastly, of the talents (v. 14—30). Hereupon follows a description of the solemn 
judgment, which the Messiah would hold over all nations, and in which, according 
as the duties of humanity were observed or neglected, he would award blessedness 
or misery (v. 3I~~~46).<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p>Thus in these discourses Jesus announces that <i>shortly<font FACE="Arial">
</font></i><font FACE="Arial">(</font><font FACE="Symbol">euqewV</font><font FACE="Arial">,
</font>XXIV. 29),<i> </i>after that calamity, which (especially according to the 
representation in Luke’s gospel) we must identify with the destruction of 
Jerusalem and its temple, and within the term of the cotemporary generation (<font FACE="Symbol">h 
genea auth</font><i>, </i>V. 34), he would visibly make his second advent in the 
clouds, and terminate the existing dispensation. Now as it will soon be eighteen 
centuries since the destruction of Jerusalem, and an equally long period since 
the generation cotemporary with Jesus disappeared from the earth, while his 
visible return and the end of the world which he associated with it, have not 
taken place: the announcement of Jesus appears so far to have been erroneous. 
Already in the first age of Christianity, when the return of Christ was delayed 
longer than had been anticipated, there arose, according to 2<i> </i>Peter iii. 
3 f., scoffers, asking: <i>where is the promise of his coming? for since the 
fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the 
creation. </i>In modern times, the inference which may apparently be drawn from 
the above consideration, to the disadvantage of Jesus and the apostles, has been 
by no one more pointedly expressed than by the Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist. No 
promise throughout the whole scriptures, he thinks, is on the one hand more 
definitely expressed, and on the other, has turned out more flagrantly false, 
than this, which yet forms one of the main pillars of Christianity. And he does 
not see in this a mere error, but a premeditated deception on the part of the 
apostles (to whom, and not to Jesus himself, he attributes that promise, and the 
discourses in which it is contained); a deception induced by the necessity of 
alluring the people on whose contributions they wished to subsist, by the 
promise of a speedy reward: and discernible by the boldness of their attempts to 
evade the doubts springing from the protracted delay of the return of Christ: 
Paul, for example, in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, sheltering 
himself in obscure </p>
<p>* Compare, on the import and connexion of this discourse, Fritzsche, in 
Matth., p. 695 ff; De Wette, exeg. Handb., I, I, s. i97 ff; Weizel, die 
unchristliche Unsterblichkeitslehre, in the theol. Studien und Kritiken, 1836, 
s. 599 ff.—In agreement with these commentators I append the following division 
of the passage in Matthew:</p>
<p>I. Signs of the <i>end, </i><font FACE="Symbol">teloV</font>, XXIV. 4—54.</p>

15—28.</p>
<p>b<i>. </i>Its culminating point: the advent of the Messiah, together with the 
assembling of his elect, 29—31. (Here follow retrospective observations and 
warnings, xxiv.32—xXV. 30.)</p>
<p>c<i>. </i>Close of the <font FACE="Symbol">teloV</font> with the messianic 
judgment, 31—46.</p>
<p align="center">658</p>
<p>phrases; and Peter, in his second epistle, resorting to the preposterous 
expedient of appealing to the divine mode of reckoning time, in which a thousand 
years are equal to one day.<sup>* </sup></p>
<p>Such inferences from the discourse before us would inflict a fatal wound on 
Christianity; hence it is natural that exegetists should endeavour by all means 
to obviate them.* And as the whole difficulty consists in Jesus having 
apparently placed an event now long past, in immediate chronological connexion 
with one still future, three expedients are possible: either to deny that Jesus 
in part spoke of something now past, and to allege that he spoke solely of what 
is still future; or to deny that a part of his discourse relates to something 
still future, and thus to refer the entire prediction to what is already lying 
in the past; or lastly, to admit that the discourse of Jesus does indeed partly 
refer to something which is still future to us, but either to deny that he 
places the two series of events in immediate chronological succession, or to 
maintain that he has also noticed what is intermediate.</p>
<p>Some of the Fathers of the Church, as Irenæus and Hilary—yet living in the 
primitive expectation of the return of Christ, and at the same time not so 
practised in regular exegesis, as to be incapable of overlooking certain 
difficulties attendant on a desirable interpretation—referred the entire 
prediction, from its commencement in Matt. xxiv. to its end in Matt. xxv., to 
the still future return of Christ to judgment.† But as this interpretation 
admits that Jesus in the commencement of his discourse uses the destruction of 
Jerusalem as a type of the final catastrophe, it virtually nullifies itself. For 
what does that admission signify, but that the discourse of Jesus, in the first 
instance, produces the impression that he spoke of the destruction of Jerusalem, 
i.e. of something now past, and that only more extended reflection and 
combination can give it a relation to something still lying in futurity?</p>
<p>To modern rationalism, based as it was on naturalistic principles, the hope 
of the second advent of Christ was in every form annihilated. Hence, not 
scrupling at any exegetical violence for the sake of removing from scripture 
what was discordant with its preconceived system, it threw itself on the 
opposite side, and hazarded the attempt to refer the discourses in question, in 
their entire tenor, solely to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the events which 
immediately preceded and followed it.‡ According to this interpretation, the <i>
end </i>spoken of is only the cessation of the Judeo-Gentile economy of the 
world; what is said of the advent of Christ in the clouds, is only a figurative 
description of the promulgation and triumph of his doctrine; the assembling of 
the nations to judgment, and the </p>

<p align="center">659</p>
<p>sending of some into blessedness, and others into condemnation, is an image 
of the happy consequences which would result from embracing the doctrine and 
cause of Jesus, and the evil consequences attendant on indifference or hostility 
to them. But in this explanation there is a want of similarity between the 
symbols and the ideas represented, which is not only unprecedented in itself; 
but particularly inconceivable in this case; since Jesus is here addressing 
minds of Jewish culture, and must therefore be aware that what he said of the 
Messiah’s advent in the clouds, of the judgment, and the end of the existing 
period of the world, would be understood in the most literal sense.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the discourse of Jesus will not as a whole, admit of 
being referred either to the destruction of the Jewish state, or to the events 
at the end of the world; it would therefore be necessarily referred to something 
distinct from both, if this twofold impossibility adhered alike to all its 
parts. But the case is not so; for while, on the one hand, what is said Matt. 
XXiV. 2<i>, </i>3, 15 ff<i>. </i>of the devastation of the temple, cannot be 
referred to the end of the world: on the other hand, what is predicted XXV. 31 
ff. of the judgment to be held by the Son of Man, will not suit the destruction 
of Jerusalem. As, according to this, in the earlier part of the discourse of 
Jesus, the destruction of Jerusalem is the predominant subject, but in the 
subsequent part, the end of all things: it is possible to make a division, so as 
to refer the former to the more proximate event, the latter to the more remote 
one. This is the middle path which has been taken by the majority of modern 
exegetists, and here the only question is: where is the partition to be made? As 
it must present a space of time within which the whole period from the 
destruction of Jerusalem to the last day may be supposed to fall, and which 
therefore would include many centuries, it must, one would think, be plainly 
indicated, so as to be easily and unanimously found. It is no good augury for 
the plan, that this unanimity does not exist,—that, on the contrary, the 
required division is made in widely different parts of the discourse of Jesus.</p>
<p>Thus much on the one hand appeared to be decided: that at least the close of 
the 25th chapter, from v. 31, with its description of the solemn tribunal which 
the Messiah, surrounded by his angels, would hold over all nations, cannot be 
referred to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. Hence many theologians 
believed that they could fix the boundary here, retaining the relation to the 
end of the Jewish state until XXV. 30, and at this point making the transition 
to the end of the world.* On the very first glance at this explanation, it must 
appear strange that the great chasm which it supposes to exist between V. 30 and 
31, is marked simply by a <font FACE="Symbol">de</font>. </p>
<p>* This is the opinion of Lightfoot, in loc., Flatt, <i>Comm. de notione </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">basileia twn ouranwn<i> </i></font>in Velthusen’s und A. 
Sammiung 2, 461 ff.; Jahn, Erklärung der Weissagungen Jesu von der Zerstörung 
Jerusalems u. s. w., in Bengel’s Archiv. 2, I, S. 79 ff., and others, cited in 
Schott, S. 75f.</p>
<p align="center">660</p>
<p>Moreover, not only are the darkening of the sun and moon, earthquakes, and 
falling of the stars, understood as a mere image of the subversion of the Jewish 
state and worship; but when xxiv. 31, it is said of the Messiah, that he will <i>
come in the clouds, </i>this is supposed to mean, invisibly; <i>with power—</i>only 
observable by the effects he produces; <i>with great glory</i>—with such as 
consists in the conclusions which may be drawn from those effects; while the <i>
angels </i>who gather together the nations by the sound of the trumpet, are 
supposed to represent the apostles preaching the gospel.* Quite erroneously, 
appeal is made, in support of this merely figurative meaning, to the prophetic 
pictures of the divine day of judgment, Isa. XIII. 9 ff<i>., </i>xxiv. 18 ff.; 
Jer. iv. 23 f.; Ezek. xxxii. 7 ff.;<i> </i>Joel iii. 3 ff.; Amos viii. 9<i>; </i>
farther, to descriptions† such as Judges V. 20; Acts ii., xvii. ff.<i> </i>In 
those prophetic passages, real eclipses of the sun and moon, earthquakes, and 
the like, are intended, and are described as prodigies which will accompany the 
predicted catastrophe; the song of Deborah, again, celebrates a real 
participation of heaven in the battle against Sisera, a participation which in 
the narrative, iv. 15, is ascribed to God himself, in the song, to his heavenly 
hosts; lastly, Peter expects, that the outpouring of the spirit will be 
succeeded by the appearances in the heavens, promised among the signs of the <i>
great day of the Lord.</p>
</i>
<p>The attempt to effect a division near the end of the discourse, at xxv. 30, 
failing, from its rendering much that goes before incapable of explanation; the 
next expedient is to retreat as far towards the commencement as possible, by 
considering how far it is inevitable to recognise a relation to the immediate 
future. The first resting place is after xxiv. 28; for what is said, up to this 
point, of war and other calamities, of the abomination in the temple, of the 
necessity for speedy flight, in order to escape unprecedented misery, cannot be 
divested of a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem without the greatest 
violence: while what follows concerning the appearance of the Son of Man in the 
clouds, etc., just as imperatively demands an application to the last day.‡ But 
in the first place, it appears incomprehensible how the enormous interval, which 
on this explanation also is supposed to fall between the one portion of the 
discourse and the other, can be introduced between two verses, of all others, 
which Matthew connects by an adverb expressive of the shortest possible time (<font FACE="Symbol">euqewV</font>).<i>
</i>It has been sought to remove this inconvenience by the assertion that
<font FACE="Symbol">euqewV</font> does not here signify the quick succession of 
the one incident on the other, but only the unexpected occurrence of an event, 
and that consequently, what is here said amounts merely to this: suddenly, at 
some period (how distant is undetermined) after the calamities attendant on the 
destruction of Jerusalem, the Messiah will visibly appear. Such an </p>

<p align="center">661</p>
<p>interpretation of <font FACE="Symbol">euqewV</font> is, as Olshausen 
correctly perceives, merely a desperate resource: but even were it otherwise, it 
would afford no real aid, since not only does Mark in his parallel passage, v. 
24, by the words, <i>in those days, after that tribulation, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">en ekeinaiV</font> <font FACE="Symbol">taiV hmeraiV meta thn 
qliyin ekeinhn</font><i> </i>place the events which he proceeds to mention in 
uninterrupted chronological succession with those which he had before detailed; 
but also, shortly after this point in each of the narratives (Matt. v. 34 
parall.), we find the assurance that all this will be witnessed by the existing 
generation. As thus the opinion, that from v. 29, everything relates to the 
return of Christ to judge the world, was threatened with annihilation by v. 34; 
the word <font FACE="Symbol">genea </font>as the Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist* 
complains, was put to the torture, that it might cease to bear witness against 
this mode of division. At one time it is made to signify the Jewish nation ;<sup>†
</sup>at another the adherents of Jesus ;<sup>‡ </sup>and of both the one and 
the other Jesus is supposed to say that it will (how many generations hence 
being left uncertain) be still in existence on the arrival of that catastrophe. 
So to explain the verse in question, that it may not contain a determination of 
time, is even maintained to be necessary on a consideration of the context, v. 
35: for as in this Jesus declares it impossible to determine the period of that 
catastrophe, he cannot immediately before have given such a determination, in 
the assurance that his cotemporaries would yet live to see all of which he had 
been speaking. But this alleged necessity so to interpret the word
<font FACE="Symbol">genea</font> has long been dissipated by the distinction 
between an inexact indication of the space of time, beyond which the event will 
not be deferred (<font FACE="Symbol">genea</font>), and the precise 
determination of the epoch (<font FACE="Symbol">hmera kai wra</font>)<i> </i>at 
which it will occur; the former Jesus gives, the latter he declares himself 
unable to give.<sup>§ </sup>But the very possibility of interpreting
<font FACE="Symbol">genea</font> in the above manner vanishes, when it is 
considered, that in connexion with a verb of time, and without anything to imply 
a special application, <font FACE="Symbol">genea</font> cannot have any other 
than its original sense: i.e. <i>generation, age; </i>that in a passage aiming 
to determine the signs of the Messiah’s advent, it would be very unsuitable to 
introduce a declaration which, instead of giving any information concerning the 
arrival of that catastrophe, should rather treat of the duration of the Jewish 
nation, or of the Christian community, of which nothing had previously been 
said; that, moreover, already at v. 33, in the words <font FACE="Symbol">umeiV 
otan idhte panta, ginwskete k. t. l.</font>, YE, <i>when ye shall </i>SEE <i>all 
these things, know, etc., </i>it is presupposed that the parties addressed would 
witness the approach of the event in question; and lastly, that in another 
passage (Matt. xvi. 28 parall.) the certainty of living to see the coming of the 
Son of man is asserted not simply of <i>this generation, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">genea auth</font><i>, </i>but of <i>some standing here</i>,
<font FACE="Symbol">tineV twn wde esthkotwn,</font><i> </i>whereby it is shown 
in the most decisive manner, that in the present passage also, </p>

<p>§ </sup>Vid. Kuinöl in Matt., s. 649.</p>
<p align="center">662</p>
<p>Jesus intended by the above expression the race of his cotemporaries, who 
were not to have become extinct before that catastrophe should occur.* Unable to deny this, and yet anxious to separate as widely as possible the 
end of the world here announced, and the age of Jesus, others would find in the 
declaration before us nothing more than this: the events hitherto described will
<i>begin </i>to be fulfilled in the present age, though their complete 
fulfilment may yet be deferred many centuries.† But when already at v. 8 the 
subject is said to be the <i>beginning </i>of the tribulation, while from v. 14 
we have a description of the end of the present period of the world, which that 
tribulation would introduce, and it is here (v. 34) said, the existing 
generation shall not pass away, <font FACE="Symbol">ewV an panta tauta</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">genhtai</font>, <i>until all these things be fulfilled: </i>
we must inevitably understand by<font FACE="Symbol"> panta tauta</font><i>, all 
these things, </i>not merely the beginning, but also the last-mentioned events 
at the end of the world.</p>
<p>Thus there is still at v. 34 something which must be referred to an event 
very near to the time of Jesus: hence the discourse of Jesus cannot from so 
early a point as v. 29, refer to the end of the world, an epoch so far distant; 
and the division must be made somewhat farther on, after v. 35 or 42.‡ But on 
this plan, expressions are thrown into the first part of the discourse, which 
resist the assigned application to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem ;— 
the glorious advent of Christ in the clouds, and the assembling of all nations 
by angels (v. 30 f)<i> </i>must be regarded as the same extravagant figures, 
which formerly forbade our acceptance of another mode of division.</p>
<p>Thus the declaration v. 34 which, together with the preceding symbolical 
discourse on the fig tree (v. 32 f.), and the appended asseveration (v. 35), 
must refer to a very near event, has, both before and after it, expressions 
which can only relate to the more distant catastrophe: hence it has appeared to 
some as a sort of oasis in the discourse, having a sense isolated from the 
immediate context. Schott, for instance, supposes that, up to v. 26, Jesus had 
been speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem; that at v. 27 he does indeed make 
a transition to the events at the end of the present period of the world; but 
that at v. 32, he reverts to the original subject, the destruction of Jerusalem; 
and only at v. 36 proceeds again to</p>

<sup>
<p>† </sup>Kern, ut sup. s. 141f. That Jesus conceived the epoch at which he 
spoke to be separated from the end of the world by a far longer interval than 
would elapse before the destruction of Jerusalem, Kern thinks he can prove in 
the shortest way from v. 14, of the 24th chapter of Matthew, where Jesus says,
<i>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for </i>a
<i>witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come. </i>For such a 
promulgation of Christianity, he thinks, it is &quot;beyond contradiction&quot; that a far 
longer space of time than these few lustrums would be requisite. As it happens, 
the apostle Paul himself presents the contradiction, when he represents the 
gospel as having been already preached to that extent before the destruction of 
Jerusalem, e.g. Col. i. 5 : <font FACE="Symbol">tou euaggeliou, (6) tou

<p align="center">663</p>
<p align="left">speak of the end of the world.* But this is 
to hew the text in pieces, out of desperation. Jesus cannot possibly have spoken 
with so little order and coherence; still less can he have so linked his 
sentences together as to give no intimation of such abrupt transitions.</p>

<p>Nor is this imputed to him by the most recent critics. According to them, it 
is the Evangelist who has joined together, not in the best order, distinct and 
heterogeneous declarations of Jesus. Matthew, indeed, admits Schulz, imagined 
that these discourses were spoken without intermission, and only arbitrariness 
and violence can in this respect sever them from each other; but hardly did 
Jesus himself deliver them in this consecutive manner, and with this imprint of 
unity.† The various phases of his coming, thinks Sieffert, his figurative 
appearance at the destruction of Jerusalem, and his literal appearance at the 
last day, though they may not have been expressly discriminated, were certainly 
not positively connected by Jesus; but subjects which he spoke of in succession 
were, from their obscurity, confused together by the Evangelist.‡ And as in this 
instance there recurs the difference between Matthew and Luke, that what Matthew 
represents as being spoken on a single occasion, Luke distributes into separate 
discourses; to which it is also to be added, that much of what Matthew gives, 
Luke either has not, or has it in a different form : therefore Schleiermacher<sup>§
</sup>believed himself warranted to rectify the composition of Matthew by that 
of Luke, and to maintain that while in Luke the two separate discourses, xvii. 
22 ff. and xxi. 5 ff.,<i> </i>have each their appropriate connexion and their 
indubitable application, in Matthew (chap. xxiv. and xxv.), by the blending of 
those two discourses, and the introduction of portions of other discourses, the 
connexion is destroyed, and the application obscured. According to this, the 
discourse, Luke xxi., taken alone, contains nothing which outsteps the reference 
to the capture of Jerusalem and the accompanying events. Yet here also (v. 27) 
we find the declaration, <i>Then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a 
cloud, </i><font FACE="Symbol">tote</font> <font FACE="Symbol">oyontai ton uion 
tou anqrwpou ercomenon en nefelh; </font>and when Schleiermacher explains this 
as a mere image representing the revelation of the religious significance of the 
political and natural events before described, he falls into a violence of 
interpretation which overturns his entire opinion as to the mutual relation of 
these accounts. If, then, in the connexion of the end of all things with the 
destruction of Jerusalem, Matthew by no means stands alone, but is countenanced 
by Luke—to say nothing of Mark, whose account in this instance is an extract 
from Matthew: we may, it is true, conclude, that as in other discourses of 
Jesus, so perhaps in this also, many things which were uttered at different 
times are associated; but there is nothing to warrant </p>

<p>the supposition, that precisely what relates to the two events, which in our 
idea are so remote from each other, is the foreign matter, especially since we 
see, from the unanimous representation of the remaining New Testament writings, 
that the primitive church expected, as a speedy issue, the return of Christ, 
together with the end of the present period of the world (i Cor. x. 11, xv.51<i>
</i>; Phil. iv.5; Thess.iv.15 ff.;<i> </i>James v.8; I Pet. iv. 7; I<i> </i>John 
ii. 18; Rev. i. 1, 3, iii. 11, xxii. 7, 10, 12, 20).</p>
<p>Thus it is impossible to evade the acknowledgment, that in this discourse, if 
we do not mutilate it to suit our own views, Jesus at first speaks of the 
destruction of Jerusalem, and farther on and until the close, of his return at 
the end of all things, and that he places the two events in immediate connexion. 
There remains, therefore, but one expedient for vindicating the correctness of 
his announcement, namely, on the one hand, to assign the coming of which he 
speaks to the future, but, on the other hand, to bring it at the same time into 
the present—instead of a merely future, to make it a perpetual coming. The whole 
history of the world, it is said, since the first appearance of Christ, is an 
invisible return on his part, a spiritual judgment which he holds over mankind. 
Of this, the destruction of Jerusalem (in our passage until v. 28) is only the 
first act; in immediate succession (<font FACE="Symbol">euqewV</font>, v. 29 
ff.)<i> </i>comes the revolution effected among mankind by the publication of 
the gospel; a revolution which is to be carried on in a series of acts and 
epochs, until the end of all things, when the judgment gradually effected in the 
history of the world, will be made known by an all-comprehending, final 
revelation.* But the famous utterance of the poet, spoken from the inmost depth 
of modern conviction, is ill-adapted to become the key of a discourse, which 
more than any other has its root in the point of view proper to the ancient 
world. To regard the judgment of the world, the coming of Christ, as something 
successive, is a mode of conception in the most direct opposition to that of the 
New Testament. The very expressions by which it designates that catastrophe, as
<i>that day </i>or <i>the last day, </i><font FACE="Symbol">ekeinh</font> or
<font FACE="Symbol">escath hmera</font>,<i> </i>show that it is to be thought of 
as momentary; the <font FACE="Symbol">sunteleia tou aiwnoV</font><i>, end of the 
age </i>(v. 3), concerning the signs of which the apostles inquire, and which 
Jesus elsewhere (Matt. xiii. 39) represents under the image of the harvest, can 
only be the final close of the course of the world, not something which is 
gradually effected during this course; when Jesus compares his coming to 
lightning (xxiv. 27), and to the entrance of the thief in the night (v. 43), he 
represents it as one sudden event, and not as a series of events.† If we 
consider in addition to this the extravagant figures, which it is not less 
necessary to suppose on this interpretation, </p>

<p>than on the above-mentioned reference of the 24th chapter to the destruction 
of Jerusalem,* it will appear necessary to abstain from this expedient, as from 
all the previous ones. </p>
<p>Thus the last attempt to discover in the discourse before us the immense 
interval which, looking from our position in the present day, is fixed between 
the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of all things, having failed; we are 
taught practically that that interval lies only in our own conception, which we 
are not justified in introducing into the text. And when we consider that we owe 
our idea of that interval only to the experience of many centuries, which have 
elapsed since the destruction of Jerusalem: it cannot be difficult to us to 
imagine how the author of this discourse, who had not had this experience, might 
entertain the belief that shortly after the fall of the Jewish sanctuary, the 
world itself, of which, in the Jewish idea, that sanctuary was the centre, would 
also come to an end, and the Messiah appear in judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>§ 116. ORIGIN OF THE DISCOURSES ON THE SECOND ADVENT.</p>
<p>The result just obtained involves a consequence, to avoid which has been the 
object of all the futile attempts at explanation hitherto examined: if, namely, 
Jesus conceived and declared that the fall of the Jewish sanctuary would be 
shortly followed by his visible return and the end of. the world, while it is 
now nearly 1800 years since the one catastrophe, and yet the other has not 
arrived; it follows that in this particular, he was mistaken. Hence expositors, 
who so far yield to exegetical evidence, as to agree with us in the above 
conclusion concerning the meaning of the discourse before us, seek from 
dogmatical considerations to evade this legitimate consequence. Hengstenberg, as 
is well known, has advanced, in relation to the history*of the Hebrew prophets, 
the following theory, which has met with approval from other expositors. To the 
spiritual vision of these men, he says, future things presented themselves not 
so much through the medium of time as of space— as it were, in great pictures; 
and thus, as is the case in paintings or perspective views, the most distant 
object often appeared to them to stand immediately behind the nearest, 
foreground and background being intermingled </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>According to Kern, the appearing of the Son of Man in the clouds, 
signifies &quot;the manifestation of everything which forms so great an epoch in the 
development of the history of mankind, that from it, the agency of Christ, who 
is the governing power in the history of mankind, may be as clearly recognised 
as if the sign of Christ were seen in the heavens. The mourning of all the 
tribes of the earth is to be understood of the sorrow with which men will be 
visited, owing to the <i>judgment, </i><font FACE="Symbol">krisiV</font>,<i> </i>
which accompanies the propagation of the kingdom of Christ, as consisting in an 
expulsion of ungodliness out of the world, and the annihilation of the old man.&quot; 
Still further does Weisse allow himself to be carried away by the allegorizing 
propensity: Christ &quot;commiserates those who are with child and who give suck, 
i.e. those who would still labour and produce in the old order of things; he 
further pities those whose flight falls in the winter, i.e. in a rude, 
inhospitable period, which bears no fruit for the spirit.&quot; (Die evang. Gesch. 2, 
s. 592.)</p>
<p align="center">666</p>
<p>with each other: and this theory of a perspective vision we are to apply to 
Jesus, especially in regard to the discourse in question.<sup>* </sup>But we may 
here cite the appropriate remark of Paulus,† that as one, who in a perspective 
externally presented, does not know how to distinguish distances, labours under 
an optical delusion, i.e. errs: so likewise in an internal perspective of ideas, 
if such there be, the disregard of distances must be pronounced an error; 
consequently this theory does not show that the above men did not err, but 
rather explains how they easily might err.</p>
<p>Even Olshausen considers this theory, which he elsewhere adopts, insufficient 
in the present case to remove all appearance of error on the part of Jesus; and 
he therefore seeks to derive special grounds of justification, from the 
particular nature of the event predicted.‡ In the first place he regards it as 
indispensable to the full moral influence of the doctrine of Christ’s return, 
that this catastrophe should be regarded as possible, nay probable, at any 
moment. This consideration may indeed justify such enunciations as Matt. xxiv. 
37 ff., where Jesus admonishes to watchfulness, because no one can know how soon 
the decisive moment may arrive; but by no means such as xxiv. 34, where he 
declares that within the term of the existing generation, all will be fulfilled. 
For one whose mind is in a healthy state, conceives the possible as possible, 
the probable as probable; and if he wishes to abide by the truth, he so exhibits 
them to others : he, on the contrary, by whom the ‘merely possible or probable 
is conceived as the real, is under a mistake; and he who, without so conceiving 
it himself, yet for a moral or religious object, ‘so represents it to others, 
permits himself to use a pious fraud. Olshausen further avails himself of a 
position already noticed, namely, that the opinion that the advent of Christ is 
at hand, is a true one, inasmuch as the entire history of the world is a coming 
of Christ; though not so as to exclude his finaI coming at the end of all 
things. But if it is proved that Jesus represented his literal, final coming as 
near at hand, while, in fact, only his figurative perpetual coming occurred in 
the period indicated: he has confused these two modes of his coming. The last 
argument which Olshausen adduces—that because the acceleration or delay of the 
return of Christ depends on the conduct of men, consequently on their free-will, 
his prophecy is only to be understood conditionally—stands or falls with the 
first; for to represent something conditional as unconditional is to create a 
false impression.</p>
<p>Sieffert, likewise, regards the grounds on which Olshausen seeks to free the 
assertions of Jesus concerning his return from the imputation of error, as 
inadequate; nevertheless he holds it an impossibility to the Christian 
consciousness, to ascribe an erroneous expectation to Jesus.§ In no case would 
this furnish a warrant, </p>

<p align="center">667</p>
<p>arbitrarily to sever from each other those elements in the discourse of Jesus 
which refer to the nearer event, from those which in our view refer to the more 
remote one: rather, if we had reasons for holding such an error on the part of 
Jesus inconceivable, we must deny in general that the discourses on the second 
advent, in which those two sets of materials are so inextricably interwoven, 
originated with him. But, looking from the orthodox point of view, the question 
is not what will it satisfy the Christian consciousness of the present day to 
believe or not to believe concerning Christ? but, what stands written concerning 
Christ? and to this the above consciousness must accommodate itself as it best 
may. Considering the subject rationally, however, a feeling resting on 
presuppositions, such as the so-called Christian consciousness, has no voice in 
matters of science; and as often as it seeks to intermeddle with them, is to be 
reduced to order by the simple reprimand: <i>mulier taceat in ecciesia!</i><sup>*
</p>
</sup>
<p>But have we no other grounds for questioning that Jesus really uttered the 
predictions contained in Matt. xxiv. and xxv. parall.? In pursuing this inquiry, 
we may first take our stand on the assertion of supranaturalistic theologians, 
that what Jesus here predicts, he could not know in the natural way of 
reasonable calculation, but only in a supernatural manner.† Even the main fact, 
that the temple would be destroyed and Jerusalem laid waste, could not, 
according to this opinion, be so certainly foreknown. Who could conjecture, it 
is asked, that the Jews would carry their frantic obstinacy so far as to render 
such an issue inevitable? Who could calculate, that precisely such emperors, 
would send such procurators, as would provoke insurrection by their baseness and 
pusillanimity? Still more remarkable is it, that many particular incidents which 
Jesus foretold actually occurred. The wars, pestilence, earthquakes, famines, 
which he prophesied, may be shown in the history of the succeeding times; the 
persecution of his followers really took place; the prediction that there would 
be false prophets, and even such as would, by promises of miracles, allure the 
people into the wilderness (Matt. xxiv, 11, 24<i> </i>ff. parall.), may be 
compared with a strikingly similar passage from Josephus, describing the last 
times of the Jewish state ;<sup>‡ </sup>the <i>encompassing of Jerusalem with 
armies, </i>mentioned by Luke, with the <i>trench, </i><font FACE="Symbol">carax</font><i>,
</i>which he elsewhere (xix. 43 f.) speaks of as being cast about the city, may 
be recognized in the circumstance recorded by Josephus, that Titus caused 
Jerusalem to be enclosed by a wall ; <sup>§ </sup>lastly it may also excite 
astonishment that the declarations, <i>there shalt not be left one stone upon</p>

<font FACE="Symbol">edrafiousi se</font>, (Luke xix. 44), in relation to the 
city, were fulfilled to the letter.* </p>
<p>When on the orthodox point of view, from the impossibility of foreseeing such 
particulars in a natural manner, it is concluded that Jesus had a supernatural 
insight into the future ; this conclusion is here attended not only with the 
same difficulty as above, in connection with the announcement of his death and 
resurrection, but with another also. In the first place, according to Matthew 
(xxiv. 15), and Mark (xiii. 14), Jesus represented the first stage of the 
catastrophe as a fulfilment of the prophecy of Daniel concerning an <i>
abomination of desolation, </i>and consequently referred Dan. ix. 27<i> </i>
(comp. xi. 31, xii. 11) to an event at the destruction of Jerusalem by the 
Romans. For what Paulus maintains,—namely, that Jesus here only borrows an 
expression from Daniel, without regarding that declaration of the prophet as a 
prophecy concerning something which in his time (the time of Jesus) was still 
future— is here rendered especially inconceivable by the addition : <i>let him 
that readeth understand. </i>Now it may be regarded as an established point in 
the modern criticism and explanation of the Old Testament, that the above 
passages in Daniel have reference to the desecration of the temple by Antiochus 
Epiphanes <sup>† </sup>consequently, the interpretation of them which the 
Evangelists here lend to Jesus is a false one. But to proceed to the difficulty 
which is peculiar to the prophecy in Matt. xxiv., xxv.: only one side of it, 
that relating to Jerusalem, has been fulfilled ; the other, that relating to the 
return of Jesus and the end of the world, remains unfulfilled. Such a half-true 
prophecy as this cannot have been drawn by Jesus from his higher nature, and he 
must have been left in this matter to his human faculties. But that he should be 
able, by means of these, to foresee a result, dependent on so many fortuities as 
was the destruction of Jerusalem, with its particular circumstances, appears 
inconceivable; and hence the conjecture arises, that these discourses, in the 
definiteness which they now possess, were not uttered prior to the issue, 
consequently not by Jesus, but that they may have been put into his mouth as 
prophecies <i>after </i>the issue. Thus Kaiser, for example, is of opinion that 
Jesus threatened a terrible fate to the temple and the nation by means of the 
Romans, conditionally, in case the nation did not accept salvation from the 
Messiah, and described this fate in prophetic types; but that the unconditional 
form and the more Precise delineations were given to his discourse <i>post 
eventum. </i>Credner also infers, from the circumstances, that incidents 
accompanying the destruction of Jerusalem are put into the mouth of Jesus as 
prophecies, that the three first gospels cannot have been composed </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>More ample comparisons of the results mentioned by Josephus and 
others, with the prophecy, see in Credner, Einleit. in das N. T. I, s. 207<i>.</p>

exeg. Handb. 3, a, s. 340 f. ; De Wette, Einleit. in das A. T., § 254 ff.</p>
<p align="center">669</p>
<p>before this event <sup>* </sup>it must certainly be supposed that the 
prophecy, as we have it in the two first gospels, was formed immediately after 
or even during the issue, since here the appearance of the Messiah is predicted 
as an event that would immediately succeed the fall of Jerusalem, which in later 
years could no longer be the expectation. As this immediate chronological 
connexion of the two catastrophes is not so expressly made by Luke, it has been 
supposed that this Evangelist gives the prophecy as it was modified by 
experience, that the Messiah’s advent and the end of the world had in nowise 
followed close on the destruction of Jerusalem.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p>In opposition to these two opinions, that the prophecy in question had a 
supernatural source, and that it<i> </i>was only made after the issue; it is 
sought, in a third quarter, to show that what is here predicted, Jesus might 
really have known in a natural way.<sup>‡ </sup>While, on the one hand, it is 
held in the highest degree astonishing that the result should have so closely 
corresponded with the most minute features of the prophecy of Jesus; on the 
other hand, there are expositors by whom this correspondence is called in 
question. <i>The encompassing of Jerusalem with armies, </i>say they, is 
precisely what Titus, according to Josephus, pronounces impossible to be 
effected ;<sup>§ </sup>it is predicted that a <i>trench </i><font FACE="Symbol">
carax</font><sup> </sup>would be cast about the city, while Josephus informs us, 
that after the first attempt at forming an <i>embankment </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">cwma</font> had been rendered useless, by an act of 
incendiarism on the part of the besieged,<sup>|| </sup>Titus desisted from his 
scheme; of false Messiahs, arising in the interval between the death of Jesus 
and the destruction of Jerusalem, history says nothing; the commotions among 
nations, and the natural phenomena, in that period, are far from being so 
important as they are here represented; but above all, in these prophecies, 
especially as they are given in Matthew and Mark, it is not the destruction of 
Jerusalem which is predicted, but solely that of the temple: plain divergencies 
of the prophecy from the result, which would not exist, if either a supernatural 
glance into the future, or a <i>vaticinium post eventum </i>were concerned.</p>
<p>According to these theologians, we are on the wrong track in seeking the 
counterpart of these prophecies forwards, in the result; since it was backwards, 
on types presented in the past, that the authors looked. A mass ot such types 
was furnished by the Jewish conception of the circumstances </p>

<p>which would precede the advent of the Messiah. False prophets and Messiahs, 
war, famine and pestilence, earthquakes and commotions in the heavens, prevalent 
corruption of manners, persecution of the faithful servants of Jehovah, were 
held to be the immediate harbingers of the messianic kingdom. Moreover, in the 
prophets there are descriptions of the tribulation which would presage and 
accompany the day of the coming of Jehovah (Isa. xiii. 9 ff.; Joel i. 15, ii. 1 
ff. 10 ff., iii. 3 ff., iv. 15 f.; Zeph.i. 14 ff.; Hagg. ii. 7; Zech. xiv. 1 
ff.; Mat. iii. 1 ff), or which would precede the messianic kingdom of the saints 
(Dan. vii.—xii.), as also expressions in later Jewish writings,* so analogous 
with our evangelical prediction, as to put it beyond question, that the 
description which it gives of the time of the Messiah’s advent is drawn from a 
circle of ideas which had long been current among the Jews.</p>
<p>Another question is, whether the principal feature in the picture before us, 
the destruction of the temple and the devastation of Jerusalem, as introductory 
to the coming of the Messiah, may also be shown to have made part of the popular 
conception in the time of Jesus. In Jewish writings we find the notion, that the 
birth of the Messiah would coincide with the destruction of the sanctuary :<sup>†
</sup>but this idea was obviously first formed after the fall of the temple, in 
order that a fountain of consolation might spring out of the lowest depth of 
misery. Josephus finds in Daniel, together with what relates to Antiochus, a 
prophecy of the annihilation of the Jewish state by the Romans :<sup>‡ </sup>but 
as this is not the primary object in any of the visions in Daniel, Josephus 
might first make this interpretation after the issue, in which case it would 
prove nothing as to the time of Jesus. Nevertheless, it is conceivable, that 
already in the time of Jesus, the Jews might attribute to the prophecies of 
Daniel a reference to events yet future, although these prophecies in fact 
related to a far earlier period; and they might do so on the same grounds as 
those on which the Christians of the present age still look forward to the full 
realization of Matt. xxiv. and xxv. As immediately after the fall of the kingdom 
made of iron mixed with clay, and of the horn that speaks blasphemies and makes 
war against the saints, the coming of the Son of man in the clouds, and the 
commencement of the everlasting kingdom of the saints, is prophesied, while this 
result had not by any means succeeded the defeat of Antiochus: there was an 
inducement still to look to the future, not only for the heavenly kingdom, but 
also, since they were made immediately to precede it, for the calamities caused 
by the kingdom </p>

the stone to theKing but 1 donot think proper to relate it, since I have only 
undertaken to describe things past or things present, out not things that are 
future. </i>Now Daniel ii. 44 interprets the stone to mean the heavenly kingdom, 
which would destroy the iron one, but would itself endure for ever,—a messianic 
particular, on which Josephus does not choose to dilate. But that, correctly 
interpreted, the iron legs of the image signify the Macedonian empire, and the 
feet of iron mixed with clay, the Syrian empire which sprang out of the 
Macedonian, see De Wette, Einleit. in das N. T., §<sup> </sup>254</p>
<p align="center">671</p>
<p>of iron and clay; among which calamities, by analogy with what was predicted 
of the horn, the desecration of the temple was conspicuous. But while the 
prophecy in Daniel includes only the desecration of the temple and the 
interruption of the worship, together with (the partial <sup>* </sup>) 
destruction of the city: in the discourse before us complete destruction is 
predicted to the temple—and likewise to the city, not merely in Luke, where the 
expressions are very marked, but undoubtedly in the two other Evangelists also, 
as appears to be indicated by the exhortation to hasty flight from the city 
;—which prediction of total destruction, as it is not contained in the type, can 
apparently have been gathered only from the result. But in the first place, the 
description in Daniel with the expressions [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>shamem</b> 
and [<i>Heb. letters</i>] <b>hishkhiyth</b> (ix. 26<i> </i>f., xii. 11), which 
the LXX. translates by <font FACE="Symbol">erhmwsiV</font><i>, desolation, </i>
and <font FACE="Symbol">diafqeirw</font>, <i>I destroy, </i>may easily be also 
understood of a total destruction; and secondly, if once, in connexion with the 
sins of the nation, the temple and city had been destroyed and the people 
carried away captive, every enthusiastic Israelite, to whom the religious and 
moral condition of his fellow-countrymen appeared corrupt and irremediable, 
might thenceforth expect and predict a repetition of that former judgment. 
According to this, even those particulars in which, as we have seen in the 
foregoing section, Luke surpasses his fellow-narrators in definiteness, are not 
of a kind to oblige us to suppose, either a supernatural foreknowledge, or a <i>
vaticinium post eventum: </i>on the contrary, all may be explained by a close 
consideration of what is narrated concerning the first destruction of Jerusalem 
in 2 Kings xxv.; 2 Chron. xxxvi.; and Jer. XXXIX. 52<i>.</p>
</i>
<p>There is only one point which Jesus, as the author of this discourse, could 
not have gathered from any types, but must have drawn entirely from himself: 
namely, the declaration that the catastrophe which he described would arrive 
within the present generation. This prediction we must hesitate to derive from a 
supernatural knowledge, for the reason, already noticed, that it is only half 
fulfilled : while the other side of the fact, the striking fulfilment of at 
least the one half of the prophecy, might incline us to distrust the supposition 
of a merely natural calculation, and to regard this determination of time as a 
feature introduced into the discourse of Jesus after the issue. Meanwhile, it is 
clear from the passages cited at the conclusion of the last section, that the 
apostles themselves expected the return of Christ to take place within their 
lifetime; and it is not improbable that Jesus also believed that this event, 
together with the ruin of the city and temple, which according to Daniel was to 
precede it, was very near at hand. The more general part of the expectation, 
namely, the appearing at some future time in the clouds of heaven, to awake the 
dead, to sit in judgment, and to found an everlasting kingdom, would 
necessarily, from a consideration of Daniel, where such a coming is ascribed to 
the Son of man, be contemplated by Jesus as a part of his own destiny, so soon 
as he held </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Vid. Joseph., Antiq. xii. v.</p>
<p align="center">672</p>
<p>himself to be the Messiah; while, with regard to the time, it was natural 
that he should not conceive a very long interval as destined to elapse between 
his first messianic coming in humiliation, and his second, in glory.</p>
<p>One objection to the genuineness of the synoptical discourses on the second 
advent, is yet in reserve; it has, however, less weight in our point of view 
than in that of the prevalent criticism of the gospels. This objection is 
derived from the absence of any detailed description of the second advent of 
Jesus in the Gospel of John.<sup> * </sup>It is true that the fundamental 
elements of the doctrine of Christ’s return are plainly discoverable in the 
fourth gospel also.† Jesus therein ascribes to himself the offices of the future 
judgment, and the awaking of the dead (John v. 22—30); which last is not indeed 
numbered among the concomitants of the advent of Christ in the synoptical 
gospels, but not seldom appears in that connexion elsewhere in the New Testament 
(e.g. I<i> </i>Cor. xv. 23; I Thess. iv. 16). When Jesus, in the fourth gospel, 
sometimes denies that he is come into the world for judgment (iii. 27, viii. 15, 
xii. 47), this refers only to his first presence on earth, and is limited by 
opposite declarations, in which he asserts that he is come into the world for 
judgment (ix. 39, comp. viii. i6), to the sense that the object of his mission 
is not to condemn but to save, and that his judgment is not individual or 
partial; that it consists, not in an authoritative sentence proceeding 
subjectively from himself, but in an objective act proceeding from the intrinsic 
tendency of things, a doctrine which is significantly expressed in the 
declaration, that him who hears his word without believing <i>he </i>judges not, 
but <i>the word, which he has spoken, shall judge him in the last day </i>(<font FACE="Symbol">o 
logoV on elalhsa, krinei auton en th escath hmera,</font> xii<i> </i>48). 
Further, when the Jesus of John’s gospel says of the believer:
<font FACE="Symbol">ou krinetai</font><i>, he is not judged, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">eiV krisin ouk ercetai,</font><i> he shall not come into 
judgment </i>(iii. i8, v. 24), this is to be understood of a judgment with a 
condemnatory issue; when on the contrary, it is said of the unbeliever:
<font FACE="Symbol">hdh kekritai</font><i>, he is judged already </i>(iii. i8), 
this only means that the assigning of the merited lot to each is not reserved 
until the future judgment at the end of all things, since each one iii his 
inward disposition bears within himself the fate which is his due. This does not 
exclude a future solemn act of judgment, wherein that which has at present only 
a latent existence will be made matter of awful revelation; for in the very 
passage last quoted we find the consignment to condemnation, and elsewhere the 
awarding of future blessedness (v. 28 f., vi. 39 f., 54) associated with the 
last day and the resurrection.</p>
<p>In like manner, Jesus says in Luke also, in the same connexion in which he 
describes his return as a still future, external catastrophe, xvii. 20 f.<i> The 
kingdom of God cometh not with observation;</p>
</i><sup>
<p>* </sup>VicI. Hase. L. J., § 130.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>The passages bearing on this subject are collected and explained in 
Schott, <i>~Commentarius, </i>etc., p. 364 ff. Comp. Lücke, in loc. and Weizel, 
urchristl. Unsterblichkeitslehre, in the Theol. Studien, 1836, s. 626 ff.</p>
<p align="center">673</p>
<i>
<p>neither shall they say, lo here! or, lo</i> <i>there! for behold the kingdom 
of God is within you. </i>A certain interpretation of the words uttered by the 
Jesus of John’s gospel, supposes him even to intimate that his return was not 
far distant. The expressions already mentioned in the farewell discourses, in 
which Jesus promises his disciples not to leave them comfortless, but, after 
having gone to the Father, shortly (xvi. i6) to come again to them (xiv. 3, 18), 
are not seldom understood of the return of Christ at the last day; <sup>* </sup>
but when we<i> </i>hear Jesus say of this same return, that he will therein 
reveal himself only to his disciples, and not to the world (xiv. 19, comp. 22),<i>
</i>it is impossible to think of it as the return to judgment, in which Jesus 
conceived that he should reveal himself to good and bad without distinction. 
There is a particularly enigmatical allusion to the coming of Christ in the 
appendix to the fourth gospel, chap. xxi. On the question of Peter as to what 
will become of the apostle John, Jesus here replies, if <i>I will that he tarry 
till I come, what is that to thee? </i>(v. 22) whence, as it is added, the 
Christians inferred that John would not die, since they supposed the <i>coming
</i>(<font FACE="Symbol">ercesqai)<i> </i></font>here spoken of; to be the final 
return of Christ, in which those who witnessed it were to be changed, without 
tasting death (i Cor. xv. 51). But, adds the author correctively, Jesus did not 
say, the disciple would not die, but only, if he willed that he should tarry 
till he came, what was that to Peter? Hereby the Evangelist may have intended to 
rectify the inference in two ways. Either it appeared to him erroneous to 
identify the remaining until Jesus came, with not dying, i.e. to take the coming 
of which Jesus here spoke for the last, which would put an end to death; and in 
that case he must have understood by it an invisible coming of Christ, possibly 
in the destruction of Jerusalem<sup>† </sup>or, he held it erroneous that what 
Jesus had only said hypothetically—even if he willed the given case, that was no 
concern of Peter’s—should be understood categorically, as if such had really 
been the will of Jesus; in which case the <font FACE="Symbol">ercomai </font>
would retain its customary sense.<sup>‡ </sup></p>
<p>If, according to this, all the main features of the doctrine of the second 
advent are put into the mouth of Jesus in the fourth gospel also, still we 
nowhere find anything of the detailed, graphic description of the external 
event, which we read in the synoptical gospels. This relation between the two 
representations, creates no slight difficulty on the ordinary view of the origin 
of the gospels, and especially that of the fourth. If Jesus really spoke of his 
return so fully and solemnly as the synoptists represent him to have done, and 
treated of the right knowledge and observation of the signs as something of the 
highest importance ; it is inconceivable that the author of the fourth gospel 
could pass over all this, if he were an immediate disciple of Jesus. The usual 
mode of accounting for such an omission, by the supposition that he believed 
this part of the teaching </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Vid. Tholuck, in loc.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Comp. Tholuck, ut sup.</p>
<sup>
<p>‡ </sup>Thus Lücke, and also Tholuck, in loc.;<i> </i>Schott, p. 409.</p>
<p align="center">674</p>
<p>of Jesus to be sufficiently known from the synoptical gospels, or from oral 
tradition, is the more inadequate here in proportion as all which bears a 
prophetic character, especially when relating to events at once so much longed 
for and dreaded, is exposed to misinterpretation; as we may see from the 
rectification just noticed, which the author of John xxi. found it necessary to 
apply to the opinion of his contemporaries concerning the promise given by Jesus 
to John. Thus, in the present case, an explanatory word would have been highly 
seasonable and useful, especially as the representation of the first gospel, 
which made the end of all things follow immediately on the destruction of 
Jerusalem, must be the more an occasion of doubt and offence the nearer the 
latter event came, and in a still greater degree when it was past. And who was 
more capable of affording such enlightenment than the favourite disciple, 
particularly if, according to Mark xiii. 3, he was the only Evangelist who had 
been present at the discourse of Jesus on this subject? Hence, here again, a 
special reason for his silence is sought in the alleged destination of his 
gospel for non-judaical, idealizing Gnostics, whose point of view those 
descriptions would not have suited, and were therefore omitted.* But precisely 
in relation to such readers, it would have been a culpable compliance, a 
confirmation in their idealizing tendency, had John, out of deference to them, 
suppressed the real side of the return of Christ. The apostle must rather have 
withstood the propensity of these people to evaporate the external, historical 
part of Christianity, by giving due prominence to it; as, in his epistle, in 
opposition to their Docetism. he lays stress on the corporeality of Jesus: so, 
in opposition to their idealism, he must have been especially assiduous to 
exhibit in the return of Christ the external facts by which it would be 
signalized. Instead of this, he himself speaks nearly like a Gnostic, and 
constantly aims, in relation to the return of Christ, to resolve the external 
and the future into the internal and the present. Hence there is not so much 
exaggeration, as Olshausen supposes, in the opinion of Fleck, that the 
representation of the doctrine of Jesus concerning his return in the synoptical 
gospels, and that given in the fourth, exclude each other<sup>† </sup>for if the 
author of the fourth gospel be an apostle, the discourses on the second advent 
which the three first Evangelists attribute to Jesus, cannot have been so 
delivered by him, and vice versa. We, however, as we have said, cannot avail 
ourselves of this argument, having long renounced the pre-supposition that the 
fourth gospel had an apostolic origin. But, on our point of view, we can fully 
explain the relation which the representation of the fourth gospel bears to that 
of the synoptists. In Palestine, where the tradition recorded by the three first 
gospels was formed, the doctrine of a solemn advent of the Messiah which was 
there prevalent, and which Jesus embraced, was received in its whole breadth 
into the Christian belief: whereas in the Hellenistic-theosophic circle in which 
the fourth </p>
<sup>
<p>* </sup>Olshausen, i, s. 870.</p>
<sup>
<p>† </sup>Fleck, de regno divino, p. 483.</p>
<p align="center">675</p>
<p>gospel arose, this idea was divested of its material envelopment, and the 
return of Christ became the ambiguous medium between a real and an ideal, a 
present and a future event, which it appears in the fourth gospel.</p>
