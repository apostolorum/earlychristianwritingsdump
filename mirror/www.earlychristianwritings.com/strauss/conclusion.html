<p ALIGN="center"><b>THE DOGMATIC IMPORT OF THE LIFE OF JESUS.</b></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 144. NECESSARY TRANSITION FROM CRITICISM TO DOGMA*</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">THE results of the inquiry which we have now brought to a close, 
have apparently annihilated the greatest and most valuable part of that which 
the Christian has been wont to believe concerning his Saviour Jesus, have 
uprooted all the animating motives which he has gathered from his faith, and 
withered all his consolations. The boundless store of truth and life which for 
eighteen centuries has been the aliment of humanity, seems irretrievably 
dissipated; the most sublime levelled with the dust, God divested of his grace, 
man of his dignity, and the tie between heaven and earth broken. Piety turns 
away with horror from so fearful an act of desecration, and strong in the 
impregnable self-evidence of its faith, pronounces that, let an audacious 
criticism attempt what it will, all which the Scriptures declare, and the Church 
believes of Christ, will still subsist as eternal truth, nor needs one iota of 
it to be renounced. Thus at the conclusion of the criticism of the history of 
Jesus, there presents itself this problem: to re-establish dogmatically that 
which has been destroyed critically.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the first glance, this problem appears to exist merely as a 
challenge addressed by the believer to the critic, not as a result of the moral 
requirements of either. The believer would appear to need no re-establishment of 
the faith, since for him it cannot be subverted by criticism. The critic seems 
to require no such re-establishment, since he is able to endure the annihilation 
resulting from his own labours. Hence it might be supposed that the critic, when 
he seeks to rescue the dogma from the flames which his criticism has kindled, 
acts falsely in relation to his own point of view, since, to satisfy the 
believer, he treats what is valueless for himself as if he esteemed it to be a 
jewel; while in relation to the believer, he is undertaking a superfluous task, 
in labouring to defend that which the latter considers in no way endangered.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But on a nearer view the case appears otherwise. To all belief, 
not built on demonstration, doubt is inherent, though it may not be </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* [Internet transcription editors – Unfortunately George Eliot, 
the translator of this work from German, seems to have completely misunderstood 
the meaning Strauss intended by the title of this chapter, <i>Nothwendiger 
Übergang der Kritik in das Dogma</i>. He is not saying that Criticism should 
lead on to Dogmatics. Almost the opposite: he is saying that after Critical 
scholarship has investigated the historicity of the Gospels, it should go on and 
make a similar study of the development of Christian dogma – a task he himself 
undertook in his <i>The Christian Faith in its Doctrinal Development and 
Conflict with Modern Science</i> and, to a lesser and provisional degree, in 
this chapter. The point of the title of this section is perhaps summed up in the 
4th. paragraph – &quot;Thus our historical criticism is followed up by dogmatical 
criticism, and it is only after the faith has passed through both these trials, 
that it is thoroughly tested and constituted science.&quot;]</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">868</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">developed; the most firmly believing Christian has within him 
the elements of criticism as a latent deposit of unbelief, or rather as a 
negative germ of knowledge, and only by its constant repression can he maintain 
the predominance of his faith, which is thus essentially a re-established faith. 
And just as the believer is intrinsically a sceptic or critic, so, on the other 
hand, the critic is intrinsically a believer. In proportion as he is 
distinguished from the naturalistic theologian, and the free-thinker,—in 
proportion as his criticism is conceived in the spirit of the nineteenth 
century,—he is filled with veneration for every religion, and especially for the 
substance of the sublimest of all religions, the Christian, which he perceives 
to be identical with the deepest philosophical truth; and hence, after having in 
the course of his criticism exhibited only the differences between his 
conviction and the historical belief of the Christian, he will feel urged to 
place that identity in a just light.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Further, our criticism, though in its progress it treats of 
details, yet on becoming part of our internal conviction, resolves itself into 
the simple element of doubt, which the believer neutralizes by an equally simple
<i>veto, </i>and then spreads anew in undiminished luxuriance all the fulness of 
his creed. But hereby the decisions of criticism are only dismissed, not 
vanquished, and that which is believed is supported by no intermediate proof, 
but rests absolutely on its own evidence. Criticism cannot but direct itself 
against this absence of intermediate proof, and thus the controversy which 
seemed ended is renewed, and we are thrown back to the beginning of our inquiry; 
yet with a difference which constitutes a step forward in the discussion. 
Hitherto our criticism had for its object the data of Christianity, as 
historically presented in the evangelical records; now, these data having been 
called in question in their historical form, assume that of a mental product, 
and find a refuge in the soul of the believer; where they exist, not as a simple 
history, but as a reflected history, that is, a confession of faith, a received 
dogma. Against this dogma, presenting itself totally unsupported by evidence, 
criticism must in deed awake, as it does against all deficiency of proof, in the 
character of a negativing power, and a contender for intermediate proof: it 
will, however, no longer be occupied with history, but with doctrines. Thus our 
historical criticism is followed up by dogmatical criticism, and it is only 
after the faith has passed through both these trials, that it is thoroughly 
tested and constituted science.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This second process through which the faith has to pass, ought, 
like the first, to be made the subject of a distinct work: I shall here merely 
give a sketch of its most important features, that I may not terminate an 
historical criticism without pointing out its ultimate object, which can only be 
arrived at by dogmatical criticism as a sequel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 145. THE CHRISTOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX SYSTEM.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The dogmatic import of the life of Jesus implicitly received, 
and developed on this basis, constitutes the orthodox doctrine of the Christ.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Its fundamental principles are found in the New Testament. The 
root of faith in Jesus was the conviction of his resurrection. He who had been 
put to death, however great during his life, could not, it was thought, be the 
Messiah: his miraculous restoration to life proved so much the more strongly 
that he <i>was </i>the Messiah. Freed by his resurrection from the kingdom of 
shades, and at the same time elevated above the sphere of earthly humanity, he 
was now translated to the heavenly regions, and had taken his place at the right 
hand of God (Acts ii. 32<b> </b>ff.,<i> </i>iii. 15 ff.,<i> </i>v. 30 ff.; and 
elsewhere). Now, his death appeared to be the chief article in his messianic 
destination; according to Isa. liii., he had suffered for the sins of his people 
and of mankind (Acts viii. 32 ff.;<i> </i>comp. Matt. xx. 28;<b> </b>John i. 29,<i><b>
</b></i>36; <b>i </b>John ii. 2);<i><b> </b></i>his blood poured out on the 
cross, operated like that which on the great day of atonement the high priest 
sprinkled on the mercy-seat (Rom. iii. 25);<b> </b>he was the pure lamb by whose 
blood the believing are redeemed (i<b> </b>Pet. i. 18 f.); the eternal, sinless 
high priest, who by the offering of his own body, at once effected that, which 
the Jewish high priests were unable to effect, by their perpetually repeated 
sacrifices of animals (Heb. x. 10 ff., etc.). But, thenceforth, the Messiah who 
was exalted to the right hand of God, could not have been a common man: not only 
was he anointed with the divine spirit in a greater measure than any prophet 
(Acts iv. 27,<i><b> </b></i>x.<i><b> </b></i>38); not only did he prove himself 
to be a divine messenger by miracles and signs (Acts ii. 22);<b> </b>but also, 
according as the one idea or the other was most readily formed, either he was 
supernaturally engendered by the Holy Spirit (Matt. and Luke i.), or he had 
descended as the Word and Wisdom of God into an earthly body (John i.). As, 
before his appearance on the earth, he was in the bosom of the Father, in divine 
majesty (John xvii. 5):<i> </i>so his descent into the world of mortals, and 
still more his submission to an ignominious death, was a voluntary humiliation, 
to which he was moved by his love to mankind (Phil. ii. 5 ff.).<i> </i>The risen 
and ascended Jesus will one day return to wake the dead and judge the world 
(Acts i. ii, xvii. 31); he even now takes charge of his church (Rom. Vi1I. 34; 1 
John ii. i), participating in the government of the world, as he originally did 
in its creation (Matt. xxviii. 18; John i. 3, 10; Col. i. 16 f<i>.). </i>In 
addition to all this, every trait in the image of the Messiah as sketched by the 
popular expectation, was attributed with necessary or gratuitous modifications 
to Jesus; nay, the imagination, once stimulated, invented new characteristics.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">How richly fraught with blessing and elevation, with 
encouragement and consolation, were the thoughts which the early Church </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">870</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">derived from this view of the Christ! By the mission of the Son 
of God into the world, by his delivery of himself to death for the sake of the 
world, heaven and earth are reconciled (2<i> </i>Cor. v. 18 ff.<i> </i>; Eph. i. 
10; Col. i. 20); by this most stupendous sacrifice, the love of God is securely 
guaranteed to man (Rom. v. 8 ff., viii. 31 ff.;<i> </i>i John iv. 9), and the 
brightest hopes are revealed to him. Did the Son of God become man? Then are men 
his brethren, and as such the children of God, and heirs with Christ to the 
treasure of divine bliss (Rom. viii. 16 f., 29). The servile relation of man to 
God, as it existed under the law, has ceased; love has taken the place of the 
fear of the punishment threatened by the law (Rom. viii. 15; Gal. iv. 1 ff.). 
Believers are redeemed from the curse of the law by Christ’s sacrifice of 
himself, inasmuch as he suffered a death on which the law had laid a curse (Gal. 
iii. 13). Now, there is no longer imposed on us the impossible task of 
satisfying all the demands of the law (Gal. iii. 10 f.)—a task which, as 
experience shows, no man fulfils (Rorn. i. 18—iii. 20), which, by reason of his 
sinful nature, no man can fulfil (Rom. v. 12 ff.), and which only involves him 
who strives to fulfil it, more and more deeply in the most miserable conflict 
with himself (Rom. vii. 7 ff.): whereas he who believes in Christ, and confides 
in the atoning efficacy of his death, possesses the favour of God; not by works 
and qualifications of his own, but by the free mercy of God, is the man who 
throws himself on that mercy just before God, by which all self-exaltation is 
excluded (Rorn. iii.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">1 ff.).<i> </i>As the Mosaic law is no longer binding on the 
believer, he being dead to it with Christ (Rom. vii. 1 ff.); as, moreover, by 
the eternal and all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ, the Jewish sacrificial and 
priestly service is abolished (Heb.); therefore the partition wall which 
separated the Jews and Gentiles is broken down: the latter, who before were 
aliens and strangers to the theocracy, without God and without hope in the 
world, are now invited to participate in the new covenant, and free access is 
opened to them to the paternal God; so that the two portions of mankind, 
formerly separated by hostile opinions, are now at peace with each other, 
members in common of the body of Christ—stones in the spiritual building of his 
Church (Eph. ii. 11 ff.). But to have justifying faith in the death of Christ, 
is, virtually, to die with him spiritually—that is, to die to sin; and as Christ 
arose from the dead to a new and immortal life, so must the believer in him 
arise from the death of sin to a new life of righteousness and holiness, put off 
the old man and put on the new (Rom. vi. 1 ff.). In this, Christ himself aids 
him by his Spirit, who fills those whom he inspires with spiritual strivings, 
and makes them ever more and more free from the slavery of sin (Rom. viii. 1 
ff.).<i> </i>Nor alone spiritually, will the Spirit of Christ animate those in 
whom he dwells, but corporeally also, for at the end of their earthly course, 
God, through Christ, will resuscitate their bodies, as he did the body of Christ 
(Rom. viii. 11). Christ, whom the bonds of death and the nether world could not 
hold, </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">871</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">has vanquished both for us, and has delivered the believer from 
the fear of these dread powers which rule over mortality (Rom. viii. 38 f.; I 
Cor. xv. 55 ff.;<i> </i>Heb. ii. 14 f.). His resurrection not only confers 
atoning efficacy on his death (Rom. iv. <i>25), </i>but at the same time is the 
pledge of our own future resurrection, of our share in Christ in a future life, 
in his messianic kingdom, to the blessedness of which he will, at his second 
advent, lead all his people. Meanwhile, we may console ourselves that we have in 
him an Intercessor, who from his own experience of the weakness and frailty of 
our nature, which he himself assumed, and in which he was in all points tempted 
as we are, but without sin, knows how much indulgence and aid we need (Heb. ii. 
17 f., iv. 15 f.).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The expediency of describing in compendious forms the riches of 
their faith in Christ, was early felt by his followers. They celebrated him as
<i>Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right 
hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us, </i><font FACE="Symbol">
CristoV o apoqanwn, mallon de kai egerqeiV, oV kai estin</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">en dexia tou qeou, oV kai entugcanei uper hmwn </font>(Rom. 
viii. 34); or with more particularity as <i>Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made 
of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God 
with power, according to the Spirit of holinesss, by the resurrection from the 
dead, </i><font FACE="Symbol">I. C. o KurioV, genomenoV ek</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">spermatoV Dabid kata sarka, orisqeiV uioV qeou en</font>
<font FACE="Symbol">dunamei kata pneuma agiwsunhV, ex anastasewV nekrwn.</font> 
(Rom. 1. 3 f.); and as <i>confessedly the great mystery of godliness, </i>
<font FACE="Symbol">omologoumenwV mega thV eusebeiaV musthrion</font><i>, </i>
the following propositions were presented: <i>God was manifest in the flesh, 
justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on 
in the world, received up into glory, </i><font FACE="Symbol">qeoV efanerwqh en 
sarki, edikaiwqh en pneumati, wfqh</font> <font FACE="Symbol">aggeloiV, ekhrucqh 
en eqnesin, episteuqh en kosmw,</font> <font FACE="Symbol">anelhfqh en doxh.</font> 
(i Tim. iii. i6).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The baptismal formula (Matt. xxviii. 19), by its allocation of 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, presented a sort of framework in which to arrange 
the materials of the new faith. On this basis was constructed in the first 
centuries what was called the rule of faith, <i>regula fidei, </i>which in 
divers forms, some more concise, others more diffuse, some more popular, others 
more subtle, is found in the different fathers.<sup>* </sup>The more popular 
form at length settled into what is called the creed of the apostles. This 
symbol, in that edition of it which is received in the evangelical church, has 
in its second and most elaborate article on the Son, the following points of 
belief: <i>et (credo) in Jesum Christum, filium ejus (Dei patris) unicum, 
Dominum nostrum; qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria virgine; 
passus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus et sepultus, descendit ad inferna; 
tertia die resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit ad cælos, sedet ad dextram Dei patris 
omnipotentis; inde venturus est, judicare vivos et mortuos.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
</i>

Prax. ii. de veland. virg. i. Orig. de principp. prooem. iv</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">872</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Together with this popular form of the confession of faith in 
relation to Christ, there was also framed a more rigorous and minute theological 
digest, occasioned by the differences and controversies which early arose on 
certain points. The fundamental thesis of the Christian faith, that <i>the Word 
was made flesh, </i><font FACE="Symbol">o logoV sarx egeneto</font>, or, <i>God 
was manijèsted in the flesh, </i><font FACE="Symbol">qeoV efanerwqh en sarki,
</font>was endangered on all sides, one questioning the Godhead, another the 
manhood, and a third the veritable union of the two natures.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that those who, like the Ebionites, denied the 
Godhead, or like that sect of the Gnostics called Docetæ, the manhood of Christ, 
separated themselves too decidedly from the Christian community, which on her 
part maintained that <i>it was necessary that the mediator of God and man should 
unite both in friendship and harmony by means of a proper relationship to each, 
and that while he represented man to God, he should reveal God to man</i>.<sup>*
</sup>But when it was merely the plenitude of the one nature or the other, which 
was contested,—as when Arius maintained that the being who became man in Christ 
was indeed divine, but created, and subordinate to the supreme God; when, while 
ascribing to Christ a human body, he held that the place of the soul was 
occupied by that superior being; when Apollinaris maintained that not only the 
body of Jesus was truly human, but his soul also, and that the divine being only 
served in the stead of the third principle in man, the <font FACE="Symbol">nouV</font>
<i>(understanding) </i>;—these were opinions to which it was easier to give a 
Christian guise. Nevertheless the Church rejected the Arian idea of a 
subordinate God become man in Jesus, for this reason among others less 
essential, that on this theory the image of the Godhead would not have been 
manifested in Christ ; <sup>† </sup>and she condemned the idea of Arius and 
Apollinaris, that the human nature of Christ had not the human
<font FACE="Symbol">yuch </font><i>(soul), </i>or the human <font FACE="Symbol">
nouV</font> <i>(understanding), </i>for this reason chiefly, that only by the 
union of the divine, with an entire human nature, could the human race be 
redeemed.<sup>‡ </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only might the one or the other aspect of the nature of 
Christ be defaced or put out of sight, but in relation also to the union of the 
two, there might be error, and again in two opposite directions. The devout 
enthusiasm of many led them to believe, that they could not draw too closely the 
newly-entwined bond between heaven and earth; hence they no longer wished to 
distinguish between the Godhead and manhood in Christ, and since he had appeared 
in one person, they acknowledged in him only one nature, that of the Son of God 
made flesh. Others, more scrupulous, could not reconcile themselves to such a 
confusion of the divine and the </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">human : it seemed to them blasphemous to say that a human mother 
had given birth to God: hence they maintained that she had only borne the man 
whom the Son of God selected as his temple; and that in Christ there were two 
natures, united indeed so far as the adoration of his followers was concerned, 
but distinct as regarded their essence. To the Church, both these views appeared 
to encroach on the mystery of the incarnation: if the two natures were held to 
be permanently distinct, then was the union of the divine and human, the vital 
point of Christianity, destroyed; if a mixture of the two were admitted, then 
neither nature in its individual quality was capable of a union with the other, 
and thus again no true unity would be attained. Hence both these opinions were 
condemned, the latter in the person of Eutyches, the former, not with equal 
justice, in that of Nestorius; and as the Nicene creed established the true 
Godhead of Christ, so that of Chalcedon established his true and perfect 
manhood, and the union of the two natures in one undivided person. When 
subsequently there arose a controversy concerning the will of Christ, analogous 
to that concerning his nature, the Church, in accordance with its previous 
decisions, pronounced that in Christ, as the God-man, there were two wills, 
distinct but not discordant,, the human will being subordinate to the divine.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In comparison with the controversies on the being and essence of 
Christ, the other branch of the faith, the doctrine of his work, was developed 
in tranquillity. The most comprehensive view of it was this: the Son of God, by 
assuming the human nature, gave it a holy and divine character <sup>* </sup>
—above all he endowed it with immortality ; <sup>† </sup>while in a moral view, 
the mission of the Son of God into the world being the highest proof of the love 
of God, was the most efficacious means of awakening a return of love in the 
human breast.<sup>‡ </sup></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To this one great effect of the appearance of Christ, were 
annexed collateral benefits: his salutary teaching, his sublime example, were 
held up to view,<sup>* </sup>but especial importance was attached to the violent 
death which he suffered. The idea of substitution, already given in the New 
Testament, was more fully developed: the death of Jesus was regarded, now as a 
ransom paid by him to the devil for the liberation of mankind, who had fallen 
into the power of the evil one through sin; now as a means devised by God for 
removing guilt, and enabling him to remit the punishment threatened to the sins 
of man, without detriment to his truthfulness, Christ having, taken that 
punishment on himself. <sup>† </sup>The latter idea was worked up Anselm, in his 
book entitled <i>Cur Deus homo, </i>into the well known theory of satisfaction, 
by which the doctrine of Christ’s work of redemption is placed in the closest 
connexion with that of his person. Man owes to God perfect obedience; but the 
sinner—and such are all men—withholds from God the service and honour which are 
His due. Now God, by reason of his justice, Cannot suffer an offence against his 
honour: therefore, either man must voluntarily restore to God that which is 
God’s, nay, must, for complete satisfaction, render to him more than he has 
hitherto withheld; or, God must as a punishment take from man that which is 
man’s, namely, the happiness for which he was originally created. Man is not 
able to do the former; for as he owes to God all the duties that he can perform, 
in order not to fall into sin, he can have no overplus of merit, wherewith to 
cover past sins. On the other hand, that God should obtain satisfaction by the 
infliction of eternal punishment, is opposed to his unchangeable goodness, which 
moves him actually to lead man to that bliss for which he was originally 
destined. This, however, cannot happen consistently with divine justice, unless 
satisfaction be made for man, and according to the measure of that which has 
been taken from God, something be rendered to him, greater than all else except 
God. But this can be none other than God himself; and as, on the other hand, man 
alone can satisfy for man: it must therefore be a God-man who gives 
satisfaction. Moreover this cannot consist in active obedience, in a sinless 
life, because every reasonable being owes this to God on his own behalf; but to 
suffer death, the wages of sin, a sinless being is not bound, and thus the 
satisfaction for the sins of man consists in the death of the God-man, whose 
reward, since he himself, as one with God, cannot be rewarded, is put to the 
account of man.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">to the union of the divine and human natures in one person: 
according to them, in the act of this union, <i>unitio personalis, </i>which was 
simultaneous with the conception, it was the divine nature of the Son of God 
which adopted the human into the unity of its personality; the state of union, 
the <i>unio personalis, </i>was neither essential, nor yet merely accidental, 
neither mystical nor moral, still less merely verbal, but a real and 
supernatural union, and eternal in its duration. From this union with the divine 
nature, there result to the human nature in Christ certain preeminent 
advantages: namely, what at first appears a deficiency, that of being in itself 
impersonal, and of having personality only by its union with the divine nature; 
further, impeccability, and the possibility of not dying. Besides these special 
advantages, the human nature of Christ obtains others also from its union with 
the divine. The relation of the two natures is not a dead, external one, but a 
reciprocal penetration, a <font FACE="Symbol">percwrhsiV</font>;<i> </i>an union 
not like that of two boards glued together, but like that of fire and metal in 
glowing iron, or of the body and soul in man. This communion of natures, <i>
communio naturarum, </i>is manifested by a communication of properties, <i>
communicatio idiomatum, </i>in virtue of which the human nature participates in 
the advantages of the divine, and the divine in the redeeming work of the human. 
This relation is expressed in the propositions concerning the person, <i>
propositionibus personalibus, </i>and those concerning the properties, <i>
idiomaticis; </i>the former are propositions in which the concrete of the one 
nature, i.e. the one nature as conceived in the person of Christ, is predicated 
of the other, as in i Cor. xv. 47: <i>the second man is the Lord from heaven,-
</i>the latter are propositions in which determinations of one or the other 
nature, are referred to the entire person <i>(genus idiomaticum), </i>or in 
which acts of the entire person are referred to one or the other nature <i>
(genus apotelesmaticum), </i>or lastly, in which attributes of the one nature 
are transferred to the other, which however is only possible from the divine to 
the human, not from the human to the divine <i>(genus auchematicum).</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In passing through the successive stages of the work of 
redemption, Christ with his person endowed with two natures, experienced, 
according to the expression of the dogmatical theologians, founded on Phil. ii. 
6 ff.,<i> </i>two states, <i>statum exinanitionis, </i>and <i>statum 
exaltationis. </i>His human nature in its union with the divine, participated 
from the moment of conception in divine properties : but as during his earthly 
life Jesus made no continuous use of them, that life to the time of his death 
and burial, is regarded as a state of humiliation: whereas, with the 
resurrection, or even with the descent into hell, commenced the state of 
exaltation which was consummated by the <i>sessio ad dextram patris.</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">As to the work of Christ, the doctrine of our Church attributes 
to him a triple office. As prophet, he has revealed to man the highest truth, 
the divine decree of redemption, confirming his testimony by miracles; and he 
still unceasingly controls the announcement of this truth. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As high priest, he has, on the one hand, by his irreproachable

he has borne, in his sufferings and death, the punishment which impended over us
<i>(obedientia passiva), </i>and now perpetually intercedes for us with the 
Father. Lastly, as king, he governs the world, and more particularly the Church, 
which he will lead from the conflicts of earth to the glory of heaven, 
completing its destiny by the general resurrection and the last judgment.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 146. OBJECTIONS TO THE CHRISTOLOGY OF THE CHURCH.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Reformed Church did not go thus far with the Lutherans in 
their doctrine of the person of Christ, for they did not admit the last and 
boldest consequence drawn by the latter from the union of the manhood and 
God-head—the <i>communicatia idiomatum, </i>or communication of properties. The 
Lutherans themselves did not hold that the properties of the human nature were 
communicated to the divine, nor that all the properties of the divine nature, 
eternity for example, could be communicated to the human ;<sup>* </sup>and this 
gave occasion on the part of the Reformed Church, to the following objection: 
the communication of properties must be reciprocal and complete, or it is none 
at all; moreover, by the communication of the properties of an infinite nature 
to a finite one, the latter is not less annihilated as to its essence than an 
infinite nature would be, were it to receive the properties of a finite one.<sup>†
</sup>When the Lutherans sought shelter in the position, that the properties of 
the one nature were only so far shared by the other, as according to its 
character is possible, <i>uti per suam indolem potest,</i><sup>‡ </sup>they in 
fact did away altogether with the <i>communicatio idiomatum; </i>and indeed this 
doctrine has been explicitly given up even by orthodox theologians since 
Reinhard.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the simple root of this complicated exchange of properties, 
the union of the divine and human natures in one person, has also met with 
contradiction.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Socinians denied it on the ground that two natures, each of 
which alone constitutes a person, cannot be united to form a single person, 
especially when they possess properties so opposite, as where the one is 
immortal, the other mortal, the one uncreated, the other created; <sup>§ </sup>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">agree with them, insisting more particularly that the formulæ of 
the Church, in which the above union is defined, are almost entirely negative, 
thus presenting no conception to the mind, and that in a Christ, who by the aid 
of a divine nature dwelling within him, withstood evil and kept himself from 
sin, the man who is destitute of such aid can have no true example.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The essential and tenable points of the rationalistic objections 
to this doctrine, have been the most acutely perceived and arranged by 
Schleiermacher, who, on this subject as on many others, has brought the negative 
criticism of the dogmas of the Church to completeness.<sup>† </sup>Before all 
else he finds it a difficulty, that by the expression, <i>divine nature </i>and
<i>human nature, </i>divinity and humanity are placed under one category, and 
what is more, under the category of nature, which essentially denotes only a 
limited being, conceived by means of its opposite. Further, while ordinarily one 
nature is common to many individuals or persons, here one person is supposed to 
partake of two different natures. Now if by person be meant the permanent 
conscious unity of a living being, and by nature, the sum of the laws which 
govern the conditions of life in that being: it is not to be conceived, how two 
opposite systems of conditions can have but one centre. The absurdity of this 
doctrine becomes, according to Schleiermacher, especially evident in the 
supposition of two wills in Christ, since, for consistency, two wills must be 
associated with two understandings, and as the understanding and will constitute 
the personality, Christ would on this supposition be inevitably divided into two 
persons. It is true that the two wills are supposed always to will in unison : 
but, on the one hand, there results from this only a moral, not a personal 
unity; on the other hand, this unison of wills is not possible in relation to 
the divine and the human will, since the latter, which from its very essence can 
only exercise itself on particulars as they present themselves in succession, 
can as little will the same with the former, whose object is the whole in its 
development, as the human understanding, which acts by reasoning, can think the 
same with the divine understanding, which acts intuitively. Hence it evidently 
follows also that a communication of properties between the two natures is not 
to be admitted.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The doctrine of the work of Christ did not escape a similar 
criticism. Passing over what has been objected in point of form to the division 
of this work into three offices, the ideas of revelation and miracles, under the 
head of the prophetic office, were chiefly called in question. It was argued 
that these ideas agreed neither </p>

the perfect God could not have created a world which from time to time needed 
the extraordinary interposition of the Creator, nor more particularly a human 
nature which was incapable of attaining its destination by the development of 
its innate faculties; that the immutable Being could not operate on the world 
first in this manner, then in that, at one time mediately, at another 
immediately, but that he must always have operated on it in the same manner, 
namely, in himself and on the whole immediately, but for us and on individuals 
mediately; that to admit an interruption of the order of nature, and of the 
development of humanity, would be to renounce all rational thought, while, in 
the particular case in question, a revelation or miracle is not confidently to 
be recognized as such, since, in order to be sure that certain results have not 
proceeded from the powers of nature and the faculties of the human mind, a 
perfect knowledge of the resources of both would be requisite, and of such a 
knowledge man is not possessed.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the main difficulty lay in the office of high priest, 
attributed to Jesus— in the doctrine of the atonement. That which especially 
drew forth objections was the human aspect which in Anselm’s system was given to 
the relation of God to the Son of man. As it well becomes man to forgive 
offences without exacting vengeance, so, thought Socinus, might God forgive the 
offences committed against him by men, without satisfaction.<sup>† </sup>To meet 
this objection Hugo Grotius argued, that not as in consequence of personal 
injuries, but to maintain the order of the moral world inviolable, or in virtue 
of his <i>justitia rectoria, </i>God cannot forgive sins without satisfaction.<sup>‡
</sup>Nevertheless, granting the necessity for satisfaction, it did not appear 
to be met by the death of Jesus. While Anselm, and still more decidedly Thomas 
Aquinas,<sup>§ </sup>spoke of a <i>satisfactio superabundans, </i>Socinus denied 
that Christ had even borne as much punishment as men have deserved; for every 
individual man having deserved eternal death, consequently, as many substitutes 
as sinners ought to have suffered eternal death ; whereas in this case, the 
single Christ has suffered merely temporal death, and that as an introduction to 
the highest glory; nor did this death attach to his divine nature, so that it 
might be said to have infinite value, but only to his human nature. On the other 
hand, Duns Scotus,<sup>|| </sup>in opposition to Thomas, and subsequently 
Grotius and the Arminians (equi-distant from orthodoxy and Socinianism), adopted 
the expedient of maintaining, that the merit of Christ was indeed in itself 
finite like its subject, his human nature, and hence was inadequate </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">as a satisfaction for the sins of the world; but that God 
accepted it as adequate out of his free grace. But from the admission that God 
can content himself with an inadequate satisfaction, and thus can forgive a part 
of the guilt without satisfaction, it follows necessarily, that he must also be 
able thus to forgive the whole. Besides these more precise definitions, 
however,, the fundamental idea of the whole fabric, namely, that one individual 
can take upon himself the punishment due to the sins of another, has been 
attacked as an ignorant transference of the conditions of a lower order of 
relation to a higher. Moral transgressions, it has been said, are not 
transmissible obligations; it is not with them as with debts of money, which it 
is immaterial to the creditor who pays, provided they are paid; rather it is 
essential to the punishment of sin, that it should fall on the guilty only.<sup>*
</sup>If, according to this, the so-called passive obedience of Christ cannot 
have been vicarious, still less can his active obedience have been so, since as 
man he was bound to render this on his own behalf.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In relation to the kingly office of Christ, the hope of his 
second advent to judge the world lost ground in the sentiment of the Church, in 
proportion as the opinion obtained, that every individual enters on a state of 
complete retribution immediately after death, for this opinion made the general 
judgment appear superfluous.<sup>‡ </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 147. THE CHRISTOLOGY OF RATIONALISM.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Rationalists, rejecting the doctrine of the Church 
concerning Christ, his person, and his work, as self-contradictory, useless, 
nay, even hurtful to the true morality of the religious sentiment, propounded in 
its stead a system which, while it avoided all contradictions, yet in a certain 
sense retained for Jesus the character of a divine manifestation, which even, 
rightly considered, placed him far higher, and moreover embodied the strongest 
motives to practical piety. <sup>§ </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to them, Jesus was still a divine messenger, a special 
favourite and charge of the Deity, inasmuch as, furnished by the disposition of 
Providence with an extraordinary measure of spiritual endowment, he was born in 
an age and nation, and guided in a career, the most favourable to his 
development into that for which he was destined; and, especially, inasmuch as he 
was subjected to a species of death that rendered possible his apparent 
resurrection, on wlìich depended the success of his entire work, and was 
encompassed by a series of circumstances which actually brought that 
resurrection to pass. The Rationalists hold that their idea of the </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Christ is not essentially below the orthodox one, as regards his 
natural endowments and his external destiny, for in their view also he is the 
greatest man that ever trod the earth—a hero, in whose fate Providence is in the 
highest degree glorified: while, as regards the internal development and free 
agency of Jesus, they believe their doctrine essentially to surpass that of the 
Church. The Christ of the Church, they contend, is a mere automaton, whose 
manhood lies under the control of his Godhead like a lifeless instrument, which 
acts with moral perfection because it has no power to sin, and for this reason 
can neither have moral merit, nor be the object of affection and reverence 
according to the rationalistic view, on the contrary, Jesus had implanted in him 
by God the natural conditions only of that which he was ultimately to become, 
and his realization of this destiny was the result of his own spontaneity. His 
admirable wisdom he acquired by the judicious application of his intellectual 
powers, and the conscientious use of all the aids within his reach; his moral 
greatness, by the zealous culture of his moral dispositions, the restraint of 
his sensual inclinations and passions, and a scrupulous obedience to the voice 
of his conscience: and on these alone rested all that was exalted in his 
personality, all that was encouraging in his example.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">As regards the work of Jesus, the rationalistic view is, that he 
has endeared himself to mankind by this above all else, that he has taught them 
a religion to which for its purity and excellence is justly ascribed a certain 
divine power and dignity; and that he has illustrated and enforced this religion 
by the brilliant example of his own life. This prophetic office of Christ is 
with Socinians and Rationalists the essence of his work, and to this they refer 
all the rest, especially what the doctrine of the Church comprehends under the 
office of high priest. With them the so-called active obedience has value solely 
as an example; and the death of Jesus conduces to the forgiveness of sins, 
solely by furthering the reformation of the sinner in one of these two ways: 
either, as a confirmation of his doctrine, and a type of the devoted fulfilment 
of duty, it serves to kindle a zeal for virtue; or, as a proof of the love of 
God to man, of his inclination to pardon the converted sinner, it invigorates 
moral courage.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Christ was no more, and did no more, than this rationalistic 
doctrine supposes, it is not easy to see how piety has come to make him her 
special object, or dogmatism to lay down special propositions concerning him. 
Consistent Rationalists have in fact admitted, that what the orthodox dogma 
calls Christology, forms no integral part of the rationalistic system, since 
this system consists indeed of a religion which Christ taught, but not of a 
religion of which he is the object; that, viewing Christology as the doctrine of 
the Messiah, it is merely an accommodation to the Jewish mind,—that even taken 
in a more noble sense, as the doctrine of the life, the actions, </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">and the fate of Jesus as a divine messenger, it does not belong 
to a system of faith, for the universal truths of religion are as little 
connected with our ideas concerning the person of him who first enunciated them, 
as are the philosophical propositions in the systems of Leibnitz and Wolf, of 
Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, with the opinions we may happen to form of the 
persons of their authors; that what relates to the person and work of Jesus 
belongs, not to religion itself, but to the history of religion, and must either 
be prefixed to a system of religious doctrine as an historical introduction, or 
appended to it as an elucidatory sequel.<sup>* </sup>Accordingly Henke, in his
<i>Lineaments, </i>has removed Christology from its wonted position as an 
integral part of systematic theology, and has placed it as a subdivision under 
the head of anthropology.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, however, Rationalism enters into open war with the 
Christian faith, for it seeks to thrust into the background, nay, to banish from 
the province of theology, that which is its essential point, and cornerstone. 
But this very opposition is decisive of the insufficiency of the rationalistic 
system, proving that it does not perform what is demanded from every system of 
religious doctrine, namely, first, to give adequate expression to the faith 
which is the object of the doctrine; and secondly, to place this expression in a 
relation, whether positive or negative, to science. Now the Rationalists, in the 
effort to bring the faith into harmony with science, restrict its expression; 
for a Christ who is only a distinguished man, creates indeed no difficulty to 
the understanding, but is not the Christ in whom the Church believes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 148. THE ECLECTIC CHRISTOLOGY OF SCHLEIERMACHFR.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is the effort of this theologian to avoid both these 
ungrateful results, and without prejudice to the faith, to form such a 
conception of the doctrine of the Christ as may be proof against the attacks of 
science.<sup>† </sup>On the one hand, he has adopted in its fullest extent the 
negative criticism directed by Rationalism against the doctrine of the Church, 
nay, he has rendered it even more searching; on the other hand, he has sought to 
retain what Rationalism had lost, the essential part of positive Christianity : 
and thus he has saved many in these days from the narrowness of Supranaturalism, 
and the emptiness of Rationalism. This simplification of the faith 
Schleiermacher effects in the following manner: he does not set out, with the 
Protestant, from the doctrine of Scripture, nor with the Catholic from the 
decision of the church, for in both these ways he would have to deal with a 
precise, developed system, which, having originated in remote centuries, must 
come into collision with the science of the present day; but he sets out from 
the consciousness of the Christian, from that internal experience resulting to 
the individual </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">from his connexion with the Christian community, and he thus 
obtains a material which, as its basis is feeling, is more flexible, and to 
which it is easier to give dialectically a form that satisfies science.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a member of the Christian church—this is the point of 
departure in the Christology of Schleiermacher <sup>* </sup>I am conscious of 
the removal of my sinfulness, and the impartation of absolute perfection: in 
other words, in communion with the church, I feel operating upon me the 
influence of a sinless and perfect principle. This influence cannot proceed from 
the Christian community as an effect of the reciprocal action of its members on 
each other; for to every one of these sin and imperfection are inherent, and the 
cooperation of impure beings can never produce anything pure as its result. It 
must be the influence of one who possessed that sinlessness and perfection as 
personal qualities, and who moreover stands in such a relation to the Christian 
community, that he can impart these qualities to its members : that is, since 
the Christian church could not exist prior to this impartation, it must be the 
influence of its founder. As Christians, we find something operated within us; 
hence, as from every effect we argue to its cause, we infer the influence of 
Christ, and from this again, the nature of his person, which must have had the 
powers necessary to the exertion of this influence.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">To speak more closely, that which we experience as members of 
the Christian church, is a strengthening of our consciousness of God, in its 
relation to our sensuous existence; that is, it is rendered easier to us to 
deprive the senses of their ascendancy within us, to make all our impressions 
the servants of the religious sentiment, and all our actions its offspring. 
According to what has been stated above, this is the effect wrought in us by 
Christ, who imparts to us the strength of his consciousness of God, frees us 
from the bondage of sensuality and sin, and is thus the Redeemer. In the feeling 
of the strengthened consciousness of God which the Christian possesses by his 
communion with the Redeemer, the obstructions of his natural and social life are 
not felt as obstructions to his consciousness of God; they do not interrupt the 
blessedness which he enjoys in his inmost religious life; what has been called 
evil, and divine chastisement, is not such for him: and as it is Christ who by 
receiving him into the communion of his blessedness, frees him therefrom, the 
office of expiation is united to that of redemption.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this sense alone is the doctrine of the church concerning the 
threefold office of Christ to be interpreted. He is a prophet, in that by the 
word—by the setting forth of himself, and not otherwise,—he could draw mankind 
towards himself, and therefore the chief object of his doctrine was his own 
person; he is at once a high priest and a sacrifice, in that he, the sinless 
one, from whose existence, therefore, no evil could be evolved, entered into 
communion with the life of sinful humanity, and endured the evils which adhere 
to it, that he might take us into communion with his sinless and blessed life:
</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* Glaubenslehre, 2, §§ 92—505.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">883</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">in other words, deliver us from the power and consequences of 
sin and evil, and present us pure before God; lastly, he is a king, in that he 
brings these blessings to mankind in the form of an organized society, of which 
he is the head.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">From this which Christ effects, we gather what he is. If we owe 
to him the continual strengthening of the consciousness of God within us, this 
consciousness must have existed in him in absolute strength, so that it, or God 
in the form of the consciousness, was the only operative force within him, and 
this is the sense of the expression of the church—God became man in Christ. If, 
further, Christ works in us a more and more complete conquest over sensuality, 
in himself there must have been an absolute conquest over it; in no moment of 
his life can the sensual consciousness have disputed the victory with his 
consciousness of God; never can a vacillation or struggle have had place within 
him: in other words, the human nature in him was sinless, and in the stricter 
sense, that, in virtue of the essential predominance within him of the higher 
powers over the lower, it was impossible for him to sin. By this peculiarity of 
his nature he is the Archetype, the actualization of the ideal of humanity, 
which his church can only approach, never surpass; yet must he,—for otherwise 
there could be no true fellowship between him and us,—have been developed under 
the ordinary conditions of human life: the ideal must in him have been perfectly 
historical, each phasis of his actual life must have borne the impress of the 
ideal; and this is the proper sense of the church formula, that the divine and 
human nature were in him united into one person.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only thus far can the doctrine of the Christ be deduced from the 
experience of the Christian, and thus far, according to Schleiermacher, it is 
not opposed to science: whatever in the dogma of the church goes beyond 
this,—as, for example, the supernatural conception of Jesus, and his miracles, 
also the facts of the resurrection and ascension, and the prophecies of his 
second coming to judge the world,—ought not to be brought forward as integral 
parts of the doctrine of the Christ. For he from whose influence upon us comes 
all the strengthening of our consciousness of God, may have been the Christ, 
though he should not have risen bodily from the dead, and ascended into heaven, 
etc. : so that we believe these facts, not because they are involved in our 
internal experience, but only because they are stated in Scripture; not so much, 
therefore, in a religious and dogmatical, as in an historical manner.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This Christology is undeniably a beautiful effort of thought, 
and as we shall presently see, does the utmost towards rendering the union of 
the divine and the human in Christ conceivable; but if its author supposed that 
he kept the faith unmutilated and science unoffended, we are compelled to 
pronounce that he was in both points deceived.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* This opinion has been already put forth in the most noted 
reviews of Schleiermacher’s. system; comp. Braniss, über Schleiermacher’s 
Glaubenslebre; H. Schmid, über Schl. Glaubensl. s. 263 ff. ; Baur, die christl. 
Gnosis, s. 626 ff., and the Review of Rosenkranz,. Jahrb. für wiss. Kritik, 
1831.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">884</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Science opens its attack on the proposition, that the ideal man 
was historically manifested in the person of Christ. It did not escape 
Schleiermacher himself that this was a dangerous point. No sooner has he put 
forth the above proposition, than he reflects on the difficulty of supposing 
that the ideal should be realized in one historical individual; since, in other 
cases, we never find the ideal realized in a single appearance, but only in an 
entire cycle of appearances, which reciprocally complete each other. It is true 
that this theologian does not hold the character of Christ, as the ideal man, to 
extend to the manifold relations of human life, so as to be the archetype for 
all the science, art, and policy, that are developed in human society; he 
confines it to the domain of the consciousness of God. But, as Schmid has justly 
observed, this does not alter the case, for the consciousness of God also, 
being, in its development and manifestation, subject to the conditions of 
finiteness and imperfection; the supposition that even in this department 
exclusively, the ideal was manifested in a single historical individual, 
involves a violation of the laws of nature by a miracle. This, however, is far 
from alarming Schleiermacher; on the contrary, he maintains that this is the 
place, and the only place, in which the Christian doctrine must necessarily 
admit a miracle, since the originating of the person of Christ can only be 
conceived as the result of a special divine act of creation. It is true, he 
limits the miraculous to the first introduction of Christ into the series of 
existences, and allows the whole of his further development to have been subject 
to all the conditions of finite existence: but this concession cannot repair the 
breach, which the supposition only of one miracle makes in the scientific theory 
of the world. Still less can any help be derived from vague analogies like the 
following: as it is still possible that matter should begin to agglomerate and 
thence to revolve in infinite space; so science must admit, that there may be in 
the domain of spiritual life an appearance, which in like manner we can only 
explain as the commencement, the first point, in a higher process of 
development.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This comparison suggests the observation made by Braniss, 
namely; that it would be contrary to the laws of all development to regard the 
initial member of a series as the greatest—to suppose that in Christ, the 
founder of that community, the object of which is the strengthening of the 
consciousness of God, the strength of this consciousness was absolute, a 
perfection which is rather the infinitely distant goal of the progressive 
development of the community founded by him. Schleiermacher does indeed 
attribute to Christianity perfectibility in a certain sense: not as a capability 
of surpassing Christ in his nature, but solely in the conditions of its 
manifestation. His view is this: the limitation, the imperfection of </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* 2ter Sendschreiben.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">885</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">the relations of Christ, the language in which he expressed 
himself, the nationality within which he was placed, modified his thoughts and 
actions, but in their form alone; their essence remained nevertheless the 
perfect ideal. Now if Christianity in its progressive advancement in doctrine 
and practice, rejects more and more of those temporal and national limitations 
by which the actions and teaching ot Jesus were circumscribed; this is not to 
surpass Christ, it is rather to give a more perfect expression of his inner 
life. But, as Schmid has satisfactorily shown, an historical individual is that 
which appears of him, and no more; his internal nature is known by his words and 
actions, the condition of his age and nation are a part of his individuality, 
and what lies beneath this phenomenal existence as the essence, is not the 
nature of this individual, but the human nature in general, which in particular 
beings operates only under the limitations of their individuality, of time, and 
of circumstances. Thus to surpass the historical appearance of Christ, is to 
rise nearer, not to his nature, but to the idea of humanity in general; and if 
we are to suppose that it is still Christ whose nature is more truly expressed, 
when with the rejection of the temporal and national, the essential elements of 
his doctrine and life are further developed: it would not be difficult, by a 
similar abstraction, to represent Socrates, as the one who in this manner cannot 
be surpassed.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">As neither an individual in general, nor, in particular, the 
commencing point in an historical series, can present the perfect ideal: so, if 
Christ be regarded decidedly as man, the archetypal nature and development which 
Schleiermacher ascribes to him, cannot be brought to accord with the laws of 
human existence. Impeccability, in the sense of the impossibility of sinning, as 
it is supposed to exist in Christ, is a quality totally incompatible with the 
human nature; for to man, in consequence of his agency being liable to guidance 
by the motives of the senses as well as of the reason, the possibility of 
sinning is essential. And if Christ was entirely free from inward conflict, from 
all vacillation of the spiritual life between good and evil, he could not be a 
man of like nature with us; for the action and re-action between the<i> </i>
spiritual nature in general and the external world, and, in particular, between 
the superior religious and moral powers, and the operations of the mind in 
subordination to the senses, necessarily manifests itself as a conflict.<sup>*
</p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">If, on the one side, the Christology in question is far from 
satisfying science, it is equally far, on the other side, from satisfying the 
faith. We<i> </i>will not enter into those points in which, instead of the 
decisions of the church, it<i> </i>at least offers acceptable substitutes 
(concerning which, however, it may be doubted whether they are a full 
compensation).<sup>† </sup>Its disagreement with the faith is the most 
conspicuous in the position, that the facts of the resurrection and ascension do 
not form essential parts of the Christian faith. </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">886</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the belief in the resurrection of Christ is the foundation 
stone, without which the Christian church could not have been built; nor could 
the cycle of Christian festivals, which are the external representation of the 
Christian faith, now suffer a more fatal mutilation than by the removal of the 
festival of Easter: the Christ who died could not be what he is in the belief of 
the church, if he were not also the Christ who rose again.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus the doctrine of Schleiermacher concerning the person and 
conditions of Christ, betrays a twofold inadequacy, not meeting the requirements 
either of the faith of the church, or of science. It is clear, however, from his 
doctrine of the work of Christ, that in order to satisfy the former so far as is 
here done, such a contradiction of the latter was quite unnecessary, and an 
easier course might have been pursued. For resting merely on a backward 
inference from the inward experience of the Christian as the effect, to the 
person of Christ as the cause, the Christology of Schleiermacher has but a frail 
support, since it cannot be proved that that inward experience is not to be 
explained without the actual existence of such a Christ. Schleiermacher himself 
did not overlook the probable objection that the church, induced merely by the 
relative excellence of Jesus, conceived an ideal of absolute perfection, and 
transferred this to the historical Christ, from which combination she 
continually strengthens and vivifies her consciousness of God: but he held this 
objection to be precluded by the observation, that sinful humanity, by reason of 
the mutual dependence of the will and the understanding, is incapable of 
conceiving an immaculate ideal. But, as it has been aptly remarked, if 
Schleiermacher claims a miracle for the origination of his real Christ, we have 
an equal right to claim one for the origination of the ideal of a Christ in the 
human soul.<sup>* </sup>Meanwhile, it is not true that sinful human nature is 
incapable of conceiving a sinless ideal. If by this ideal be understood merely a 
general conception, then the conception of the perfect and the sinless is as 
necessarily co-existent with the consciousness of imperfection and sinfulness as 
the conception of infinity with that of finiteness; since the two ideas 
conditionate one another, and the one is not possible without the other. If, on 
the other hand, by this ideal be meant a concrete image, the conception of a 
character in which all the individual features are portrayed, it may be admitted 
that a sinful individual or age cannot depict such an image without blemish; but 
of this inability the age or individual itself is not conscious, not having any 
superior standard, and if the image be but slightly drawn, if it leave room for 
the modifications of increased enlightenment, it may continue to be regarded as 
immaculate even by a later and more clear-sighted age, so long as this age is 
inclined to view it under the most favourable light.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">We may now estimate the truth of the reproach, which made 
Schleiermacher so indignant, namely, that his was not an historical, </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* Baur, ut sup. s. 653.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">887</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">but an ideal Christ. it is unjust in relation to the opinion of 
Schleiermacher, for he firmly believed that the Christ, as construed by him, 
really lived; but it is just in relation to the historical state of the facts, 
because such a Christ never existed but in idea; and in this sense, indeed, the 
reproach has even a stronger bearing on the system of the church, because the 
Christ therein presented can still less have existed. Lastly, it is just in 
relation to the consequence of Schleiermacher’s system, since to effect what 
Schleiermacher makes him effect, no other Christ is necessary, and, according to 
the principles of Schleiermacher respecting the relation of God to the world, of 
the supernatural to the natural, no other Christ is possible, than an ideal one 
:—and in this sense the reproach attaches specifically to Schleiermacher’s 
doctrine, for according to the premises of the orthodox doctrine, an historical 
Christ is both possible and necessary.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attempt to retain in combination the ideal in Christ with 
the historical, having failed, these two elements separate themselves: the 
latter falls as a natural residuum to the ground, and the former rises as a pure 
sublimate into the ethereal world of ideas. Historically, Jesus can have been 
nothing more than a person, highly distinguished indeed, but subject to the 
limitations inevitable to all that is mortal: by means of his exalted character, 
however, he exerted so powerful an influence over the religious sentiment, that 
it constituted him the ideal of piety; in accordance with the general rule, that 
an historical fact or person cannot become the basis of a positive religion 
until it is elevated into the sphere of the ideal.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Spinoza made this distinction when maintaining, that to know the 
historical Christ is not necessary to felicity, but only to know the ideal 
Christ, namely the eternal wisdom of God, which is manifested in all things in 
the human mind particularly, and in a pre-eminent degree in Jesus Christ—that 
wisdom which alone teaches man what is true and false, good and bad.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Kant, also, it ought not to be made a condition of 
salvation to believe, that there was once a man who by his holiness and merit 
gave satisfaction for himself and for all others; for of this the reason tells 
us nothing; but it <i>is </i>the duty of men universally to elevate themselves 
to the ideal of moral perfection deposited in the reason, and to obtain moral 
strength by the contemplation of this </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* Thus Schmid, ut sup. s. 267.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">888</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">ideal. Such moral faith alone man is bound to exercise, and not 
historical faith.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Taking his stand on this principle, Kant proceeds to interpret 
the doctrines of the Bible and the church as Symbols of the ideal. It is 
humanity, or the rational part of this system of things, in its entire moral 
perfection, that could alone make a world the object of divine Providence, and 
the end of creation. This idea of a humanity well-pleasing to God, has existed 
in God from all eternity; it proceeds from his essence, and is therefore no 
created thing, but his eternal Son, the Word, through whom, that is, for whose 
sake, all things were created, and in whom God loved the world. As this idea of 
moral perfection has not man for its author, as it has been introduced into him 
even without his being able to conceive how his nature can have been susceptible 
of such an idea, it may be said to have come down to us from heaven, and to have 
assumed the human nature, and this union with us may be regarded as an abasement 
of the Son of God. This ideal of moral perfection, so far as it is compatible 
with the condition of a being dependent on necessities and inclinations, can 
only be conceived by us under the form of a man. Now just as we can obtain no 
idea of the amount of a force, but by calculating the degree of resistance which 
it can overcome, so we can form no estimate of the strength of the moral 
disposition, but by imagining hard conflicts in which it can triumph: hence the 
man who embodies the perfect ideal must be one who would voluntarily undertake, 
not only to perform every duty of man on his own behalf, and by precept and 
example to disseminate the good and the true around him as extensively as 
possible; but also, though tempted by the strongest allurements, to submit to 
all sufferings, even to the most ignominious death, for the welfare of mankind.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a practical relation this idea has its reality completely 
within itself, and it needed no exemplification in experience in order to become 
a model binding on us, since it is enshrined as such in our reason. Nay, this 
ideal remains essentially confined to the reason, because it cannot be 
adequately represented by any example in outward experience, since such an 
example would not fully disclose the inward disposition, but would only admit of 
our forming dubious inferences thereon. Nevertheless, as all men ought to be 
conformed to this ideal, and consequently must be capable of such conformity, it 
is always possible in experience that a man may appear, who in his teaching, 
course of life, and sufferings, may present an example of a man well-pleasing to 
God: but even in this manifestation of the God-man, it would not properly be 
that which is obvious to the senses, or can be known by experience, which would 
be the object of saving faith; but the ideal lying in the reason, which we 
should attribute to this manifestation of the God-man, because he appeared to us 
to be conformed to it—that is, indeed, so far only as this can </p>

<i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="center">889</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">be concluded from outward experience. Inasmuch as all of us, 
though naturally generated men, feel bound, and consequently able, ourselves to 
present such an example, we have no reason to regard that exemplification of the 
ideal man as supernaturally generated, nor does he need the attestation of 
miracles; for besides the moral faith in the idea, nothing further is requisite 
than the historical conviction that his life was conformed to that idea, in 
order to accredit him as its personification.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">He who is conscious of such a moral disposition, as to have a 
well-founded confidence, that under temptations and sufferings similar to those 
which are attributed to the ideal man, as a touchstone of his moral disposition, 
he would adhere unalterably to this exemplar, and faithfully follow his steps, 
such a man alone is entitled to consider himself an object of the divine 
complacency. To elevate himself to such a state of mind, man must depart from 
evil, cast off the old man, crucify the flesh; a change which is essentially 
connected with a series of sorrows and sufferings. These the former man has 
deserved as a punishment, but they fall on the new: for the regenerated man, who 
takes them on himself, though physically and in his empirical character, as a 
being determined by the senses, he remains the former man; is morally, as an 
intellectual being, with his changed disposition, become a new man. Having by 
this change taken upon him the disposition of the Son of God, that which is 
strictly a substitution of the new man for the old, may be represented, by a 
personification of the idea, as a substitution of the Son of God, and it may be 
said, that the latter himself, as a substitute, bears for man, for all who 
practically believe in him, the guilt of sin; as a redeemer, satisfies supreme 
justice by suffering and death; and as an intercessor, imparts the hope of 
appearing justified before the judge: the suffering which the new man, in dying 
to the old, must perpetually incur through life, being conceived in the 
representative of mankind, as a death suffered once for all.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kant, like Schleiermacher (whose Christology in many respects 
recalls that of Kant),<sup>† </sup>carries his appropriation of the Christology 
of the church no further than the death of Christ: of his resurrection and 
ascension, he says, that they cannot be available to religion within the limits 
of pure reason, because they would involve the materiality of all existences. 
Still, in another light, he employs these facts as symbols of the ideas of the 
reason; as images of the entrance into the abode of blessedness, that is, into 
communion with all the good: while Tieftrunk has yet more decidedly given it as 
his opinion, that without the resurrection, the history of Jesus would terminate 
in a revolting catastrophe; that the eye would turn away with melancholy and 
dissatisfaction from an event, in which the pattern of humanity fell a victim to 
impious rage, and in which the scene closed with a death as unmerited as 
sorrowful; that the history </p>

towards which the moral contemplations of every one are irresistibly drawn—with 
the passage into a compensating immortality.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the same manner, De Wette ascribed to the evangelical 
history, as to every history, and particularly to the history of religion, a 
symbolical, ideal character, in virtue of which it is the expression and image 
of the human mind and its various operations. The history of the miraculous 
conception of Jesus represents the divine origin of religion; the narratives of 
his miracles, the independent force of the human mind, and the sublime doctrine 
of spiritual self-reliance; his resurrection is the image of the victory of 
truth, a fore-shadowing of the future triumph of good over evil; his ascension, 
the symbol of the eternal majesty of religion. The fundamental religious ideas 
which Jesus enunciated in his teaching, are expressed with equal clearness in 
his history. This history is an expression of devoted enthusiasm, in the 
courageous ministry of Jesus, and in the victorious power of his appearance; of 
resignation, in his contest with the wickedness of men, in the melancholy of his 
premonitory discourses, and above all in his death. Christ on the cross is the 
image of humanity purified by self-sacrifice; we ought all to crucify ourselves 
with him, that we may rise with him to new life. Lastly, the idea of devotion 
was the key-note in the history of Jesus, every moment of his life being 
dedicated to the thought of his heavenly Father.<sup>† </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">At an earlier period, Horst presented this symbolical view of 
the history of Jesus with singular clearness. Whether, he says, all that, is 
narrated of Christ happened precisely so, historically, is a question 
indifferent to us, nor can it now be settled. Nay, if we would be candid with 
ourselves, that which was once sacred history for the Christian believer, is, 
for the enlightened portion of our cotemnporaries, only fable: the narratives of 
the supernatural birth of Christ, of his miracles, of his resurrection and 
ascension, must be rejected by us as at variance with the inductions of our 
intellect. Let them however only be no longer interpreted merely by the 
understanding as history, but by the feelings and imagination, as poetry; and it 
will be found that in these narratives nothing is invented arbitrarily, but all 
springs from the depths and divine impulses of the human mind. Considered from 
this point of view, we may annex to the history of Christ all that is important 
to religious trust, animating to the pure dispositions, attractive to the tender 
feelings. That history is a beautiful, sacred poem of the human race—a poem in 
which are embodied all the wants of our religious instinct; and this is the 
highest honour of Christianity, and the strongest proof of its universal

ought to be, and, united with him </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">by following his doctrine and example, can actually become. It 
is not denied that what to us can appear only sacred poetry, was to Paul, John, 
Matthew and Luke, fact and certain history. But it was the very same internal 
cause which made the narratives of the gospel sacred fact and history to them, 
which makes those narratives to us a sacred mythus and poetry. The points of 
view only are different: human nature, and in it the religious impulse, remains 
ever the same. Those first Christians needed in their world, for the animating 
of the religious and moral dispositions in the men of their time, history and 
fact, of which, however, the inmost kernel consisted of ideas: to us, the facts 
are become superannuated and doubtful, and only for the sake of the fundamental 
ideas, are the narratives of those facts an object of reverence.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This view was met immediately on the part of the church by the 
reproach, that instead of the riches of divine reality which faith discovers in 
the history of Christ, it palmed upon us a collection of empty ideas and ideals; 
instead of a consolatory work effected, an overwhelming obligation. For the 
certainty, that God once actually united himself with human nature, the 
admonition that man ought to obtain divine dispositions, offers a poor 
compensation for the peace which the redemption completed by Christ brings to 
the believer, it is no equivalent to put before him the duty of freeing himself 
from sin. By this system, man is thrust out of the reconciled world in which 
Christianity places him, into an unreconciled world, out of a world of happiness 
into a world of misery; for where reconciliation has yet to be effected, where 
happiness has yet to be attained, there is at present enmity and unhappiness. 
And, in truth, the hope of entire deliverance from these conditions, is, 
according to the principles of this system, which only admits an infinite 
approximation towards the idea, a deceptive one; for that which is only to be 
reached in an endless progression, is in fact unattainable.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But not the faith alone, science also in its newest development, 
has found this system unsatisfactory. Science has perceived that to convert 
ideas simply into an obligatory possibility, to which no reality corresponds, is 
in fact to annihilate them; just as it would be to render the infinite finite, 
to, represent it as that which lies beyond the finite. Science has conceived 
that the infinite has its existence in the alternate production and extinction 
of the finite; that the idea is realised only in the entire series of its 
manifestations; that nothing can come into existence which does not already 
essentially exist; and, therefore, that it is not to be required of man, that he 
should reconcile himself with God, and assimilate his sentiments to the divine, 
unless this reconciliation and this assimilation are already virtually effected.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 150. THE SPECULATIVE CHRISTOLOGY.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kant had already said that the good principle did not descend 
from heaven merely at a particular time, but had descended on mankind invisibly 
from the commencement of the human race; and Schelling laid down the 
proposition: the incarnation of God is an incarnation from eternity.<sup>* </sup>
But while the former understood under that expression only the moral instinct, 
which, with its ideal of good, and its sense of duty, has been from the 
beginning implanted in man; the latter understood under the incarnate Son of God 
the finite itself, in the form of the human consciousness, which in its 
contradistinction to the infinite, wherewith it is nevertheless one, appears as 
a suffering God, subjected to the conditions of time.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the most recent philosophy this idea has been further 
developed in the following manner.<sup>† </sup>When it is said of God that he is 
a Spirit, and of man that he also is a Spirit, it follows that the two are not 
essentially distinct. To speak more particularly, it is the essential property 
of a spirit, in the distribution of itself into distinct personalities, to 
remain identical with itself, to possess itself in another than itself. Hence 
the recognition of God as a spirit implies, that God does not remain as a fixed 
and immutable Infinite encompassing the Finite, but enters into it, produces the 
Finite, Nature, and the human mind, merely as a limited manifestation of 
himself, from which he eternally returns into unity. As man, considered as a 
finite spirit, limited to his finite nature, has not truth; so God, considered 
exclusively as an infinite spirit, shut up in his infinitude, has not reality. 
The infinite spirit is real only when it discloses itself in finite spirits; as 
the finite spirit is true only when it merges itself in the infinite. The true 
and real existence of spirit, therefore, is neither in God by himself, nor in 
man by himself, but in the God-man; neither in the infinite alone, nor in the 
finite alone, but in the interchange of impartation and withdrawal between the 
two, which on the part of God is revelation, on the part of man religion.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">If God and man are in themselves <i>one, </i>and if religion is 
the human side of this unity: then must this unity be made evident to man in 
religion, and become in him consciousness and reality. Certainly, so long as man 
knows not that he is a spirit, he cannot know that God is man: while he is under 
the guidance of nature only, he will deify nature; when he has learned to submit 
himself to law, and thus to regulate his natural tendencies by external means, 
he will set God before him as a lawgiver. But when, in the vicissitudes of the 
world’s history, the natural state discloses its corruptions, the legal its 
misery; the former will experience the need of a God who elevates it above 
itself, the latter, of a God who descends to its </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">level. Man being once mature enough to receive as his religion 
the truth that God is man, and man of a divine race; it necessarily follows, 
since religion is the form in which the truth presents itself to the popular 
mind, that this truth must appear, in a guise intelligible to all, as a fact 
obvious to the senses: in other words, there must appear a human individual who 
is recognised as the visible God. This God-man uniting in a single being the 
divine essence and the human personality, it may be said of him that he had the 
Divine Spirit for a father and a woman for his mother. His personality 
reflecting itself not in himself, but in the absolute substance, having the will 
to exist only for God, and not at all for itself, he is sinless and perfect. As 
a man of Divine essence, he is the power that subdues nature, a worker of 
miracles; but as God in a human manifestation, he is dependent on nature, 
subject to its necessities and sufferings— is in a state of abasement. Must he 
even pay the last tribute to nature ? does not the fact that the human nature is 
subject to death preclude the idea that that nature is one with the divine? No : 
the God-man dies, and thus proves that the incarnation of God is real, that the 
infinite spirit does not scorn to</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">descend into the lowest depths of the finite, because he knows 
how to find a way of return into himself, because in the most entire alienation 
of himself, he can retain his identity. Further, the God-man, in so far as he is 
a spirit reflected in his infinity, stands contrasted with men, in so far as 
they are limited to their finiteness: hence opposition and contest result, and 
the death of the God-Man becomes a violent one, inflicted by the hands of 
sinners; so that to physical degradation is added the moral degradation of 
ignominy and accusation of crime. If God then finds a passage from heaven to the 
grave, so must a way be discoverable for man from the grave to heaven : the 
death of the prince of life is the life of mortals. By his entrance into the 
world as God-man, God showed himself reconciled to man; by his dying, in which 
act he cast off the limitations of mortality, he showed moreover the way in 
which he perpetually effects that reconciliation: namely, by remaining, 
throughout his manifestation of himself under the limitations of a natural 
existence, and his suppression of that existence, identical with himself. 
Inasmuch as the death of the God-man is merely the cessation of his state of 
alienation from the infinite, it is in fact an exaltation and return to God, and 
thus the death is necessarily followed by the resurrection and ascension.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The God-man, who during his life stood before his cotemporaries 
as an individual distinct from themselves, and perceptible by the senses, is by 
death taken out of their sight; he enters into their imagination and memory: the 
unity of the divine and human in him, becomes a part of the general 
consciousness; and the church must repeat spiritually, in the souls of its 
members, those events of his life which he experienced externally. The believer, 
finding himself environed with the conditions of nature, must, like Christ, die 
to </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">894</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">nature—but only inwardly, as Christ did outwardly,—must 
spiritually crucify himself and be buried with Christ, that by the virtual 
suppression of his own sensible existence, he may become, in so far as he is a 
spirit, identical with himself, and participate in the bliss and glory of 
Christ.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 151. LAST DILEMMA.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus by a higher mode of argumentation, from the idea of God and 
man in their reciprocal relation, the truth of the conception which the church 
forms of Christ appears to be confirmed, and we seem to be reconducted to the 
orthodox point of view, though by an inverted path: for while there, the truth 
of the conceptions of the church concerning Christ is deduced from the 
correctness of the evangelical history; here, the veracity of the history is 
deduced from the truth of those conceptions. That which is rational is also 
real; the idea is not merely the moral imperative of Kant, but also an 
actuality. Proved to be an idea of the reason, the unity of the divine and human 
nature must also have an historical existence. The unity of God with man, says 
Marheineke,<sup>* </sup>was really and visibly manifested in the person of Jesus 
Christ; in him, according to Rosenkranz,<sup>† </sup>the divine power over 
nature was concentrated, he could not act otherwise than miraculously, and the 
working of miracles, which surprises us, was to him natural. His resurrection, 
says Conradi,<sup>‡ </sup>is the necessary sequel of the completion of his 
personality, and so little ought it to surprise us, that, on the contrary, we 
must rather have been surprised if it had not happened.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But do these deductions remove the contradictions which have 
exhibited themselves in the doctrine of the church, concerning the person and 
work of Christ? We need only to compare the structures, which Rosenkranz in his 
Review has passed on Schleiermacher’s criticism of the Christology of the 
church, with what the same author proposes as a substitute in his Encyclopædia, 
in order to perceive, that the general propositions on the unity of the divine 
and human natures, do not in the least serve to explain the appearance of a 
person, in whom this unity existed individually, in an exclusive manner. Though 
I may conceive that the divine spirit in a state of renunciation and abasement 
becomes the human, and that the human nature in its return into and above itself 
becomes the divine; this does not help me to conceive more easily, how the 
divine and human natures can have constituted the distinct and yet united 
portions of an historical person. Though I may see the human mind in its unity 
with the divine, in the course of the world’s history, more and more completely 
establish itself as the power </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">which subdues nature; this is quite another thing, than to 
conceive a single man endowed with such power, for individual, voluntary acts. 
Lastly, from the truth, that the suppression of the natural existence is the 
resurrection of the spirit, can never be deduced the bodily resurrection of an 
individual.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">We should thus have fallen back again to Kant’s point of view, 
which we have ourselves found unsatisfactory: for if the idea have no 
corresponding reality, it is an empty obligation and ideal. But do we then 
deprive the idea of all reality? By no means : we reject only that which does 
not follow from the premises.<sup>* </sup>if reality is ascribed to the idea of 
the unity of the divine and human natures, is this equivalent to the admission 
that this unity must actually have been once manifested, as it never had been, 
and never more will be, in one individual? This is indeed not the mode in which 
Idea realizes itself; it is not wont to lavish all its fulness on one exemplar, 
and be niggardly towards all others <sup>† </sup>—to express itself perfectly in 
that one individual, and imperfectly in all the rest: it rather loves to 
distribute its riches among a multiplicity of exemplars which reciprocally 
complete each other—-in the alternate appearance and suppression of a series of 
individuals. And is this no true realization of the idea? is not the idea of the 
unity of the divine and human natures a real one in a far higher sense, when I 
regard the whole race of mankind as its realization, than when I single out one 
man as such a realization? is not an incarnation of God from eternity, a truer 
one than an incarnation limited to a particular point of time.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is the key to the whole of Christology, that, as subject of 
the predicate which the church assigns to Christ, we place, instead of an 
individual, an idea; but an idea which has an existence in reality, not in the 
mind only, like that of Kant. In an individual, a God-man, the properties and 
functions which the church ascribes to Christ contradict themselves; in the idea 
of the race, they perfectly agree. Humanity is the union of the two natures—God 
become man, the infinite manifesting itself in the finite, and the finite spirit 
remembering its infinitude; it is the child of the visible Mother and the 
invisible Father, Nature and Spirit; it is the worker of miracles, in so far as 
in the course of human history the spirit more and more completely subjugates 
nature, both within and around man, until it lies before him as the inert matter 
on which he exercises his active power;<sup>‡ </sup>it is the sinless existence, 
for the course of its development is a blameless one, pollution cleaves to the 
individual only, and does not touch the race or its history. It is Humanity that 
dies, rises, and ascends to heaven, for from the negation of its phenomenal life 
there ever proceeds a higher spiritual life; from the suppression of its 
mortality as a personal, national, </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">and terrestrial spirit, arises its union with the infinite 
spirit of the heavens. By faith in this Christ, especially in his death and 
resurrection, man is justified before God; that is, by the kindling within him 
of the idea of Humanity, the individual man participates in the divinely human 
life of the species. Now the main element of that idea is,. that the negation of 
the merely natural and sensual life, which is itself the negation of the spirit 
(the negation of negation, therefore), is the sole way to true spiritual life.<sup>*
</p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This alone is the absolute sense of Christology: that it is 
annexed to the person and history of one individual, is a necessary result of 
the historical form which Christology has taken. Schleierrnacher was quite right 
when he foreboded, that the speculative view would not leave much more of the 
historical person of the Saviour than was retained by the Ebionites. The 
phenomenal history of the individual, says Hegel, is only a starting point for 
the mind. Faith, in her early stages, is governed by the senses, and therefore 
contemplates a temporal history; what she holds to be true is the external, 
ordinary event, the evidence for which is of the historical, forensic kind—a 
fact to be proved by the testimony of the senses, and the moral confidence 
inspired by the witnesses. But mind having once taken occasion by this external 
fact, to bring under its consciousness the idea of humanity as one with God, 
sees in the history only the presentation of that idea; the object of faith is 
completely changed; instead of a sensible, empirical fact, it has become a 
spiritual and divine idea, which has its confirmation no longer in history but 
in philosophy. When the mind has thus gone beyond the sensible history, and 
entered into the domain of the absolute, the former ceases to be essential; it 
takes a subordinate place, above which the spiritual truths suggested by the 
history stand self-supported; it becomes as the faint image of a dream which 
belongs only to the past, and does not, like the idea, share the permanence of 
the spirit which is absolutely present to itself.<sup>† </sup>Even Luther 
subordinated the physical miracles to the spiritual, as the truly great 
miracles. And shall we interest ourselves more in the cure of some sick people 
in Galilee, than in the miracles of intellectual and moral life belonging to the 
history of the world—in the increasing, the almost incredible dominion of man 
over nature—in the irresistible force of ideas, to which no unintelligent 
matter, whatever its magnitude, can oppose any enduring resistance? Shall 
isolated incidents, in themselves trivial, be more to us than the universal 
order of </p>

above view; namely, that it teaches only a substantial, not a personal unity of 
man with God. That unity which exists in the determination of the race has 
already been present in individuals separately, according to the different 
measure of their religious development, and thus the substantial unity has 
become, in different degrees, a personal unity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">events, simply because in the latter we presuppose, if we do not 
perceive, a natural cause, in the former the contrary? This would be a direct 
contravention of the more enlightened sentiments of our own day, justly and 
conclusively expressed by Schleierniacher. The interests of pity, says this 
theologian, can no longer require us so to conceive a fact, that by its 
dependence on God it is divested of the conditions which would belong to it as a 
link in the chain of nature; for we have outgrown the notion, that the divine 
omnipotence is more completely manifested in the interruption of the order of 
nature, than in its preservation.<sup>* </sup>Thus if we know the incarnation, 
death and resurrection, the <i>duplex negatio affirmat, </i>as the eternal 
circulation, the infinitely repeated pulsation of the divine life; what special 
importance can attach to a single fact, which is but a mere sensible image of 
this unending process? Our age demands to be led in Christology to the idea in 
the fact, to the race in the individual: a theology which, in its doctrines on 
the Christ, stops short at him as an individual, is not properly a theology, but 
a homily.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In what relation, then, must the pulpit stand to theology,—nay, 
how is the continuance of a ministry in the church possible when theology has 
reached this stage? This is the difficult question which presents itself to us 
in conclusion.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 152. RELATION OF THE CRITICAL AND SPECULATIVE THEOLOGY TO THE 
CHURCH.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Schleiermacher has said, that when he reflected on the 
approaching crisis in theology, and imagined himself obliged to choose one of 
two alternatives, either to surrender the Christian history, like every common 
history, as a spoil to criticism, or to hold his faith in fee to the speculative 
system; his decision was, that for himself, considered singly, he would embrace 
the latter, but that, regarding hjmself as a member of the church, and 
especially as one of its teachers, he should be induced rather to take the 
opposite course. For the idea of God and of man on which, according to the 
speculative system, the truth of the Christian faith rests, is indeed a precious 
jewel, but it can be possessed only by a few, and he would not wish to be that 
privileged individual in the church, who alone among thousands held the faith on 
its true grounds. As a member of the church, he could have no satisfaction but 
in perfect equality, in the consciousness that all receive alike, both in kind 
and manner, from the same source. And as a teacher and spokesman to the church, 
he could not possibly attempt the task of elevating old and young, without 
distinction, to the idea of God and of man: he must rather attack their faith as 
a groundless one, or else endeavour to strengthen and confirm it while knowing 
it to be groundless. As thus in the matter of religion an impassable gulf would 
be fixed between two parties in the church, the speculative </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* Glaubenslehre, 1, s. 47.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">898</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">theology threatens us with the distinction of an esoteric and 
exoteric doctrine, which ill accords with the declaration of Christ, that all 
shall be taught of God. The scientific alone have the foundation of the faith: 
the unscientific have only the faith, and receive it only by means of tradition. 
If the Ebionitish view, on the contrary, leave but little of Christ, yet this 
little is equally attainable by all, and we are thereby secured from the 
hierarchy of speculation, which ever tends to merge itself in the hierarchy of 
Rome.<sup>* </p>
</sup>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here we see presented, under the form of thought belonging to a 
cultivated mind, the same opinion which is now expressed by many in a less 
cultivated fashion : namely, that the tlleologian who is at once critical and 
speculative, must in relation to the church be a hypocrite. The real state of 
the case is this. The church refers her Christology to an individual who existed 
historically at a certain period: the speculative theologian to an idea which 
only attains existence in the totality of individuals; by the church the 
evangelical narratives are received as history: by the critical theologian, they 
are regarded for the most part as mere mythi. If he would continue to impart 
instruction to the church, four ways are open to him:</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the attempt already excluded by the above observations of 
Schleiermacher, namely, to elevate the church to his own point of view, and for 
it, also, to resolve the historical into the ideal :—an attempt which must 
necessarily fail, because to the Church all those premises are wanting on which 
the theologian rests his speculative conclusions; and upon which, therefore, 
only an enthusiast for interpretation would venture.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second and opposite measure would be, to transport himself 
to the point of view of the church, and for the sake of imparting edification 
ecclesiastically, to descend from the sphere of the ideal into the region of the 
popular conception. This expedient is commonly understood and judged too 
narrowly. The difference between the theologian and the church is regarded as a 
total one; it is thought, that in answer to the question, whether he believes in 
the history of Christ, he ought to say exactly, no; whereas he says, yes: and 
this is a falsehood. It is true, that if in the discourses and instructions of 
the spiritual teacher, the main interest were an historical one, this would be a 
correct representation of the case: but, in fact, the interest is a religious 
one,—it is essential religion which is here communicated under the form of a 
history; hence he who does not believe in the history as such, may yet 
appreciate the religious truths therein contained, equally with one who does 
also receive the history as such: the distinction is one of form merely, and 
does not affect the substance. Hence it is an evidence of an uncultivated mind, 
to denounce as a hypocrite a theologian who preaches, for example, on the 
resurrection of Christ, since, though he may not believe in the reality of that 
event as a single sensible fact, </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* In the 2ten Sendschreiben on his Glaubenslehre.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">899</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">he may, nevertheless, hold to be true the representation of the 
process of spiritual life, which the resurrection of Christ affords. Strictly 
considered, however, this identity of the substantial truth, exists only in the 
apprehension of him who knows how to distinguish the substance from the form of 
religion, <i>i.e., </i>of the theologian, not of the church, to whom he speaks. 
The latter can conceive no faith in the dogmatical truth of the resurrection of 
Christ, for example, apart from a conviction of its historical reality: and if 
it come to discover that the theologian has not this conviction, and yet 
preaches on the resurrection, he must appear in the eyes of the church a 
hypocrite, and thus the entire relation between the theologian and the church 
would be virtually cancelled.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this case, the theologian, though in himself no hypocrite, 
would appear such to the church, and would be conscious of this misconstruction. 
If notwithstanding this, he should continue to instruct the church under the 
form of its own conceptions, he would ultimately appear a hypocrite to himself 
also, and would be driven to the third, desperate course, of forsaking the 
ministerial office. It avails nothing to say, he has only to descend from the 
pulpit, and mount the professor’s chair, where he will not be under the 
necessity of withholding his scientific opinions from such as are destined to 
science; for if he, whom the course of his own intellectual culture has obliged 
to renounce the ministerial office, should by his instructions lead many to the 
same point, and thus render them also incapable of that office, the original 
evil would only be multiplied. On the other hand, it could not he held good for 
the church, that all those who pursue criticism and speculation to the results 
above presented, should depart from their position as teachers. For no clergyman 
would any longer meddle with such inquiries, if he thus ran the risk of being 
led to results which would oblige him to abandon the ministerial office; 
criticism and philosophy would fall into the hands of those who are not 
professed theologians, and to the theologian nothing would remain but the faith, 
which then could not possibly long resist the attacks of the critical and 
speculative laity. But where truth is concerned, the possible consequences have 
no weight; hence the above remark ought not to be made. Thus much, however, may 
be maintained in relation to the real question: he whom his theological studies 
have led to an intellectual position, respecting which he must believe, that he 
has attained the truth, that he has penetrated into the deepest mysteries of 
theology, cannot feel either inclined or bound just at this point in his career 
to abandon theology: on the contrary, such a step would be unnatural, nay, 
impossible.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">He will therefore seek another expedient; and as such there 
presents itself a fourth, which is not, like the two first, one-sided, nor like 
the third, merely negative, but which offers a positive mode of reconciling the 
two extremes— the consciousness of the theologian, and that of the church. In 
his discourses to the church, he will </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">indeed adhere to the forms of the popular conception, but on 
every opportunity he will exhibit their spiritual significance, which to him 
constitutes their sole truth, and thus prepare—though such a result is only to 
be thought of as an unending progress—the resolution of those forms into their 
original ideas in the consciousness of the church also. Thus, to abide by the 
example already chosen, at the festival of Easter, he will indeed set out from 
the sensible fact of the resurrection of Christ, but he will dwell chiefly on 
the being buried and rising again with Christ, which the Apostle himself has 
strenuously inculcated. This very course every preacher, even the most orthodox, 
strictly takes, as often as he draws a moral from the evangelical text on which 
he preaches: for this is nothing else than the transition from the externally 
historical to the inward and spiritual, it is true, we must not overlook the 
distinction, that the orthodox preacher builds his moral on the text in such a 
way, that the latter remains as an historical foundation ; whereas, with the 
speculative preacher, the transition from the biblical history or the church 
doctrine, to the truth which he thence derives, has the negative effect of 
annihilating the former. Viewed more closely, however, the transition of the 
orthodox preacher from the evangelical text to the moral application, is not 
free from this negative tendency; in proceeding from the history to the doctrine 
he implies at least thus much : the history is not enough, it is not the whole 
truth, it must be transmuted from a past fact into a present one, from an event 
external to you, it must become your own</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">intimate experience : so that with this transition, the case is 
the same as with the proof of the existence of God, in which the cosmical 
existence, which is the point of departure, apparently remains as a foundation, 
but is in fact negatived as a true existence, and merged in the absolute. 
Nevertheless, there remains a marked distinction between these two propositions: 
since, and in so far as, this has happens, so and so is your duty and your 
consolation—and : this is indeed related as having happened once, but the truth 
is, that it always so happened, and both in and by you ought to happen. At 
least, the community will not receive both as identical; and thus, here again, 
in every excess or diminution which the more or less spontaneous relation of the 
teacher to critical theology, together with the variety in the degrees of 
culture of the community, introduces,—the danger is incurred that the community 
may discover this difference, and the preacher appear to it, and consequently to 
himself, a hypocrite.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this difficulty, the theologian may find himself driven 
either directly to state his opinions, and attempt to elevate the people to his 
ideas: or, since this attempt must necessarily fail, carefully to adapt himself 
to the conception of the community; or, lastly, since, even on this plan, he may 
easily betray himself, in the end to leave the ministerial profession.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have thus admitted the difficulty with which the critical and 
speculative views are burthened, with reference to the relation of the </p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="center">901</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">clergyman to the church; we have exhibited the collision into 
which the theologian falls, when it is asked, what course remains for him in so 
far as he has adopted such views? and we have shown that our age has not arrived 
at a certain decision on this subject. But this collision is not the effect of 
the curiosity of an individual; it is necessarily introduced by the progress of 
time and the development of Christian theology; it surprises and masters the 
individual, without his being able to guard himself from it. Or rather he can do 
this with slight labour, if he abstain from study and thought, or, if not from 
these, from freedom of speech and writing. Of such there are already enough in 
our day, and there was no need to make continual additions to their number 
through the calumniation of those who have expressed themselves in the spirit of 
advanced science. But there are also a few, who, notwithstanding such attacks, 
freely declare what can no longer be concealed—and time will show whether by the 
one party or the other, the Church, Mankind, and Truth are best served.</p>
