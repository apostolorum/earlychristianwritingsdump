<P>
<center><h2>THE SOURCES</h2></center>
<P>
ALL indications point to the conclusion that the Christian religion, 
though an offspring of Judaism, did not issue from any of the 
great currents then dominant in Jewish thought and known under 
the name of Pharisee, Sadducee and Essene. It sprang from small 
eccentric circles and stood out so little in the history of Palestinian
Judaism before the year 70 that Josephus thought himself 
dispensed from mentioning it in his writings. [1] Christianity was 
not a contagious movement of organized asceticism, still less a form 
of legalist pietism and least of all a school of traditional conservatism.
It was distinctly a Messianist movement, carried on in 
conditions peculiar to itself and without the sanguinary fanaticism 
of the Zealots. It invoked as its head a Christ who, after dying 
on earth, was living at the right hand of God; his return would 
proceed from the higher world, that is, from his own being and 
nature, and in this sense it soon became a salvation-mystery 
of which the Christ was life and soul, the coming of this 
Christ progressively shifting its position to a new point and 
becoming realized, so to speak, in the faith of his Church. A 
mystery of this nature could not fail to get denned in a theology. 
In the beginning, however, Christianity was a religion of humble 
folk. Men of learning, dogmatizing theologians, contemplative 
dreamers were not its originators.
<P>
The Christian religion was not founded on doctrine formulated in a book. It formed its own doctrine as it grew, and the 
books distinctively its own, known among us as the literature of 
primitive Christianity, are the products and the historic witnesses 
of its doctrinal elaboration as this was achieved during the first 
hundred or hundred and fifty years in the life of the new religion. 
It may be said with confidence that Christianity, at its point of 
departure, had no other literature than that of the Judaism from 
which it sprang. This literature it began to interpret in a manner 
all its own, with reference to its Christ and in the interests of 
Christian propaganda, while reserving till later the creation of its 
own literature in answer to the needs which arose in the course of
<P>
<center>18</center>
<P>
its experience. This specifically Christian literature is the principal and almost the only source at our disposal for understanding 
Christianity in the first age of its evolution. The direct evidence 
of Jewish -writers is relatively late, scanty, of mediocre scope and 
value, while that of pagan writers concerns only the outside of 
Christian propaganda and informs us chiefly of the impression it 
made on the "enlightened" opinion of that age.
<P>
In a sense very true, the history of primitive Christianity is a 
kind of pre-history which has to be reconstructed—one might 
almost say to be guessed—from documents which reflect it but 
were not originally conceived, nor later edited, for the purpose 
of putting it on record. The labours of criticism are therefore 
indispensable, and so much the more in need of cautious handling 
as the scientific examination of these documents is far from 
having spoken its last word.
<P>
From about the year 180 onwards the history of the Christian 
religion is no longer beset by great obscurity. With the writings 
before us of Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and 
Hippolytus we have enough daylight to make visible the 
interior organization, the exterior relations and the characteristic 
doctrines of the new religion. As for the earlier period, we are 
bound to admit that information is far from complete, indeed 
almost fragmentary, and too often untrustworthy and difficult to 
interpret. The present chapter will oner a kind of inventory of 
the documents in question. The chapters to follow will unfold 
the meaning we find in them for reconstructing the history of the 
Christian religion in the earliest period of its life.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>I. THE NEW TESTAMENT</font></center>
<P>
To the books comprised in what is known as the New Testament, which forms a pendant to the collection of the Old, 
inherited from the Synagogue and from hellenizing Judaism, 
tradition assigns a place of their own as books divinely authorized 
and the work of apostles. In reality the apostolic elements in 
these books are not very numerous. They were canonized by 
and for their employment in the Christian communities for 
public reading in preference to others of similar character which 
the Church thought well, as occasion called for it, to set aside or
<P>
<center>19</center>
<P>
to condemn. We may recall that the collection of the Old Testament was also fixed in Jewish tradition, derived from synagogal 
usage, to the depreciation of a literature, apocalyptic or otherwise, and partly more recent, of which the disqualification was 
judged desirable. In both cases, Old and New, the authenticity of 
the canonized writings, relative to those excluded from the canon, 
is artificial and based on theological convention; in both cases the 
authorship of books is falsely assigned, or partly falsified, for the 
purpose of guaranteeing the exceptional credit claimed for all parts 
alike of a collection of books thenceforth to be regarded as sacred.
<P>
Although the writings comprised in the New Testament 
constitute our chief source for the history of primitive Christianity, they carry no privilege in the eyes of the scientific historian, save what may be derived from their relative value as 
evidence, when compared with non-canonical writings. All the 
documents of ancient Christianity, canonical and non-canonical, 
will be classed in this chapter according to their kind, though 
not according to their literary kind precisely, since the greater 
number do not fall into any of the accepted classes of literature. 
We shall deal first with those documents which affect, more or 
less distinctly, the form of epistles; second, with those in the form 
of apocalypse; third, with those, known as Gospels, which 
present the sacred legend of Jesus and the apostles; fourth and 
last, with the sharply defined group of second century apologists. 
Had the writings of the second century gnostics come down to 
us, them also we should have to consider; but little more is 
known of them than what can be gathered from ecclesiastical 
authors who placed these writings on their list of heresies or 
laboured to refute them.
<P>
<center><i>Pauline Epistles</i></center>
<P>
Fourteen Epistles appear in the New Testament under the 
name of Paul. Few critics have had the hardihood to class them 
all as literary forgeries, and those who have done so, Bruno 
Bauer and the Dutch school of Van Manen, seem to have taken 
insufficient account of the great variety of elements which have 
found their way into the two Epistles to the Corinthians and the 
Epistle to the Romans.
<P>
<center>20</center>
<P>
To begin with, the Epistle to the Hebrews stands apart as 
one whose origin was matter of debate in the ancient Church. 
The Roman Church, while not ignoring it, long refused to 
recognize it as Paul's and attributed to him thirteen Epistles 
only. The heretic Marcion (140-150) knew, or recognized, only 
ten, not knowing, or rejecting, the two Epistles to Timothy 
and the Epistle to Titus; he accepted the so-called Epistle to the 
Ephesians under the name of the Epistle to the Laodiceans, a name 
he can have had no reason to invent. This, however, does not 
prove the complete authenticity of the ten. That Marcion put much 
of his own into them is neither proved nor even probable; he did 
not force his system into them any more than he put it into his 
Gospel; contenting himself with cutting down or retouching in 
the Gospel of Luke whatever was in conflict with his system, he 
would do the same in the Epistles with passages that displeased 
him. The fact remains that the ten, the thirteen, or the fourteen, 
whatever their connexion with Paul, were not preserved for 
themselves as epistles, but as providing catechetical matter and 
passages to be read in public for the instruction and edifying of 
congregations. If some of them are fictitious, as seems certain, 
it cannot be a priori improbable that compilations like the 
Epistles to the Romans and the Corinthians contain considerable 
additions to their authentic elements.
<P>
<center><i>Thessalonians</i></center>
<P>
The First to the Thessalonians, if authentic, as it seems to 
be, would date from the year 51, the oldest document of Christian 
literature to which an approximate date can be assigned. It is 
not free from editorial surcharges [2] and the long passage on the
ressurrection (iv, i3-v, n) must be a late insertion. [3]
<P>
Imitated from the First Epistle and specially co-ordinated 
with the insertion on the resurrection of the dead, the Second 
to Thessalonians is, for the most part, a theological dissertation 
on the conditions of the Second Advent. It is not written for 
the instruction of a particular community but aims rather to 
dissipate the general uneasiness of Christian thought in regard 
to the Parousia, impatiently expected and continually postponed. 
The author enlarges on the apocalyptic theme of the Antichrist,
<P>
<center>21</center>
<P>
perhaps identified with Nero risen from the dead, whose manifestation was to cause the ruin of the Roman Empire. The 
document is conceived in the spirit of the synoptic Gospels and 
is probably not earlier than the first quarter of the second century. 
Since Marcion accepted it as authentic, we can hardly place it 
as late as 130-135. The pains taken by the author at the end 
(in 17) to declare his signature genuine render it the more
suspect.
<P>
<center><i>Corinthians</i></center>
<P>
The two Epistles contain elements bearing on the relations 
of Paul with the community of Corinth, during the years 50-56 
approximately, which cannot be explained on any other hypothesis
than that of their authenticity. But the two Epistles in 
their traditional form are not pieces of written correspondence. 
They are two discourses made up of letters and instructions of 
various kinds at a date considerably later than the years in which 
epistolary relations existed between Paul and his Corinthian
converts.
<P>
We gather from the first Epistle that Paul, while at Ephesus 
in 54 or 55, wrote to these converts with the aim of healing 
divisions of whose existence in the community he had been 
informed (i, i-i6); [4] the final recommendations (xvi) are coordinated with this opening and the interval between them 
filled with ill-assorted matter of various kinds. We begin with 
an eloquent outburst on the mystery of the Cross, hidden from 
the heavenly powers appointed to govern the world, who 
crucified the Lord in their ignorance (i, i7-ii, 8); [5] of this mystery, 
Paul, taught by the Spirit, is the herald (ii, 10-16); if he has not 
spoken to the Corinthians as spiritual, that is because they are 
carnal, as they are proved to be by their quarrels (iii, 1-4);
following this, a sublime conception of the apostolate and the 
consideration of Paul's unique relation to the Corinthians. All 
of which is pitched on so high a level that we cannot but ask 
whether the point of view may not be that of polemical theory 
rather than that of the modest reality. To the latter belongs 
what we go on to read about Timothy's preliminary errand, of 
Paul's impending visit to Corinth and the incestuous man whose 
excommunication he decrees. Moral lessons come next, grouped
<P>
<center>22</center>
<P>
by a certain analogy of subject, but without real cohesion. Then 
follow a mystic couplet about the old leaven, the Christian 
azyme and Christ the pascal victim of the faithful (v, 6-8);
a remark on keeping bad company awkwardly adjusted to what 
has been said about the incestuous man, which again is disastrously 
cut up and surcharged in a passage against lawsuits between 
believers; and then a moral lesson against impurity (vi, 12-20). 
From this point the document before us ceases to be a letter and 
becomes an assemblage of miscellaneous instructions: further 
rules of discipline later in origin than the beginning of apostolic 
preaching; rules on marriage and virginity (vii); [6] on the eating 
of meat that comes from pagan sacrifices, the passage cut in two 
by an editor (viii; x, 23-xi, i) [7] and doubled by mystic instruction 
on the same subject (x, 1-22) which contradicts the disciplinary 
rule first given; in the space between, an apology, mainly retro- 
spective, for the action Paul has taken to avoid being a charge 
to his converts, especially to the Corinthians (ix); [8] further on 
(xi, 3-16) two rulings on the holding of assemblies; the first, 
enjoining the women to keep veiled when they prophesy in 
course of the meeting, inserted into the framework of the second 
which has to do with the good order and especially the high 
signification of the Eucharist (xi, 2, 17-34); [9] another instruction 
on spiritual gifts divided into two parts, the theory of the charismata, their role in the life of the community, and rules for 
speaking with tongues and prophesying in the assembly of the 
faithful (xii, xiv), [10] with the Song of Love (xiii, 1-12) intercalated 
between the two parts and coming in as a corrective to the 
foregoing decree; [11] followed up by a dissertation on the bodily 
resurrection of the Christ, type of a general resurrection of the 
dead and especially of believers (xv), in which there is revealed 
a certain development of the evangelical tradition and of the 
Christian gnosis. The conclusion of the original letter (xvi)
then follows without further preparation.
<P>
The Second to the Corinthians was written from Macedonia 
in the autumn of the year 55; but this Epistle, though less complicated
than the first by editorial treatment, also contains elements 
of various date and origin. The opening (i-ii, 13) appears to 
belong to a letter of reconciliation or of consolation written by 
Paul after experiencing a great affliction while in Asia, from
<P>
<center>23</center>
<P>
which he had been delivered by the good news that Titus had 
brought him of better conditions in Corinth. The affliction in 
question was less probably persecution undergone at Ephesus 
than the anguish of mind into which Paul had fallen after making 
a visit to Corinth, which had rather aggravated the difficulties 
between him and the community, difficulties which the intervention
of Titus had subsequently smoothed over. But even in 
this part of the letter certain additions tinged with mystical 
gnosis may have been made (i, 3-7; 12-14, 2i, 22). Suddenly 
the flow of the original is arrested to make room for a long 
dithyramb in praise of the true apostleship which belongs solely 
to Paul, herald of the new convenant in the spirit, triumphant in 
weakness and suffering while waiting for eternal glory, knowing 
no man after the flesh, not even Christ, and announcing with 
unwearied zeal the message of the reconciliation of the world 
to God by faith in Christ risen from the dead; at this point he 
beseeches the Corinthians to be faithful to the grace of God and 
to enlarge their heart towards him, now straitened on his account 
(ii, i4-vi, 13). Then comes a new insertion into the flow of this 
fine utterance, which resumes its course a little later on (vii, 2—3) 
but only to lose itself immediately in a forced transition to the 
letter of reconciliation (vii, 4). The inserted passage is an in- 
struction about keeping company with pagans (vi, i4-vii, i) 
which connects with nothing in the Second to the Corinthians 
and must be a quotation from elsewhere. What follows (vii, 5-16) 
concerns the happy issue of the mission to the Corinthians 
undertaken by Titus: it forms the original conclusion of the 
letter. The two pieces about the collection for the saints in 
Jerusalem (viii, ix) hang loose from the context and cannot 
have been written at the same time; the older of the two (ix) has 
been placed second by the compiler. [12] The greater part of the 
last chapter is conceived in the same spirit and tone as the earlier 
eulogium of Paul's apostleship, except for several passages of 
a distinctly personal character which seem to come from the 
severe letter, written after Paul's second stay in Corinth, to 
which the letter of reconciliation makes allusion (vii, 8). The 
most important of these personal passages is a fighting apology 
against "the very chiefest of the apostles" (xi, 5) [13]—who are the 
elder apostles of Jerusalem and not any kind of missionaries—
<P>
<center>24</center>
<P>
to whom Paul boasts of being inferior in nothing. Here is another 
insertion about the disinterested conditions of Paul's Corinthian 
mission (xi, 6b-I2a). [14] Whereupon the denunciation of the 
super-apostles is resumed with increased vigour, Paul sounding 
his own praises in abundance by recalling his labours and tribulations,
nay even his visions, especially the most important which 
carried him up to the third heaven; [15] "a thorn in the flesh" 
warns him not to be overproud; but for all that he will yield in 
nothing to the highest of them; and his apostleship has been 
made plain by many a prodigy. Then, suddenly, the tone changes 
and the question turns to the disinterestedness Paul has shown 
among the Corinthians; he will not change that attitude; if he 
now seems to be defending himself that is because he is on the 
point of coming to Corinth for the third time and is unwilling 
to find himself in the midst of their quarrels and disorders; let 
them mend their ways that he may not have to employ severity. 
But the grandiloquent apology preceding, which shows a very 
precise knowledge of Paul's career, would perhaps be better 
understood as coming from a distance in time and from the pen 
of an empassioned disciple. It flows in the same current of thought 
and style as the praise of the apostolate in the first part of the 
Epistle.
<P>
<center><i>Galatians</i></center>
<P>
There is a question whether this Epistle, written towards the 
end of the year 55, before the Second to the Corinthians and 
the Epistle to the Romans, was addressed to the communities 
of Pisidia and Lycaonia [16] or rather to those of Galatia proper. 
Perhaps it concerned all of them. But the capital question is 
that of its authenticity. Paul would seem to have written to 
justify his apostleship against Judaizing propaganda which was 
meeting with success in the communities. Fundamentally, the 
issue concerned a matter quite other than the uselessness of the 
Jewish observances. Paul presents himself as an apostle sent 
direct from God and from Christ the redeemer (i, 1-7) and 
anathematizes those who would turn the Galatians from the 
true Gospel (i, 5-9); describes the conditions in which the 
revelation of this Gospel was directly imparted to him (i, 10-12);
how he fulfilled his vocation of apostle to the Gentiles up to
<P>
<center>25</center>
<P>
the moment when he got his doctrine and practice recognized 
by the Jerusalem apostles and the admission made that he was 
to preach to the Gentiles while the other apostles occupied 
themselves with the Jews; which form of the compact Peter is 
said to have broken at Antioch (i, i3-ii, 14). [17] But the rebuke 
which Paul boasts of having administered to Peter face to face 
is lost sight of in a formal announcement of the thesis of salvation 
by faith in the Christ without the works of the law (ii, 15-20). 
To the demonstration of this thesis by diverse arguments, all 
inspired by the mystic gnosis already met in certain parts of 
Corinthians and methodically developed in Romans, the rest 
of the Epistle is thenceforward devoted. Entangled with these 
arguments are speculations about the faith of Abraham, type of 
the justified man, who received the saving benediction due to 
faith on behalf of all believers, Jews and Gentiles (iv, 21-31). 
Throughout all this there is only one small fragment that bears 
a genuinely personal accent (iv, 11-20), where Paul describes 
his present anxiety and the special circumstances in which he 
had preached the Gospel to the Galatians. The moral counsels 
of the last two chapters are, for the most part, in the customary 
vein of mystical gnosis. [18] It is in conformity with this gnosis 
that the origin of Paul's career is here interpreted, a mode of 
interpretation under which his conversion and apostolic activity 
become almost unintelligible to the historian, and the authenticity 
of the Epistle, taken as a whole, is gravely compromised. There 
cannot be a doubt that Paul, in becoming converted, adhered to 
a gospel preached before he took it up. As a matter of fact the 
conversion of Paul was not the absolute beginning of hellenic 
Christianity, and the division of the world to be converted, 
Jews to Peter and Gentiles to Paul, was not realized. Whence we 
may infer that the division was never agreed on.
<P>
<center><i>Romans</i></center>
<P>
The document called the Epistle to the Romans, so far as it 
comes from Paul's hand, probably dates from the year 56, 
having been written at Corinth a little before Paul left that city 
to carry to Jerusalem the collection made in the communities. 
Whatever value we may assign to it, the Epistle, like the two to
<P>
<center>26</center>
<P>
the Corinthians, is a compilation. In the preamble (i, 1-17) 
Paul announces an explanatory apology for his ministry to 
pagans. Connected with this explanation is the discussion of 
Abraham's righteousness realized in his faith (iii, 28-iv), a line 
of thought already encountered in Galatians, and here completed 
by the discussion of prophetical texts which the author interprets 
as foretelling the conversion of the Gentiles and the reprobation, 
at least temporary, of the Jews. The passages at the end of the 
Gospel, describing the projects of Paul (xv, 8-38), are equally 
authentic. [19] But the theory of sin and grace, of salvation by the 
death of Christ, which is expounded at great length (v-viii) 
is clearly detached from these passages, has a style peculiar to 
itself and makes no attempt to support the argument in detail 
by scriptural texts. [20] On the other hand, certain developments [21]
seem to have been inserted to soften the rigour of this theory 
(i, i8-iii, 20) and to prevent its abuse in practice by conclusions 
that might be drawn from it. The moral part of the Epistle must 
in like manner be secondary, since it was not for Paul to offer 
such lessons to a community of which he had no personal 
knowledge; these lessons moreover were not all inserted at the 
same time (xii-xv, y). [22] The formulas of conclusion, which 
multiply towards the end (xv, 13, 33; xvi, 16, 25), bear witness 
to surcharges and retouchings.
<P>
<center><i>Colossians, Ephesians and Philippians</i></center>
<P>
The Epistles to the Colossians and Philippians, which some 
critics would attach to a hypothetical captivity at Ephesus, seem 
rather to have been written while Paul was a prisoner in Rome 
between 59 and 61. But the authenticity of Colossians is contestable.
In it there is developed a mystical gnosis in affinity with that 
in Romans, though sensibly different in its formulas, [23] and akin 
to the Epistle to the Hebrews (cf. Hebrews i, 1-4). This gnosis 
has the appearance of being affirmed in opposition to another 
of Judaizing tendency which may possibly be the cult of Zeus 
Sabazios (ii, 16-23). Certain incoherences in the editing of the 
Epistle lead us to think that a document of Christian gnosis was 
attributed to Paul, as an afterthought, by means of the additions 
concerning his captivity, an authentic letter being utilized at
<P>
<center>27</center>
<P>
the end for establishing a close relation between the Epistle to 
the Colossians and that to Philemon, as we now have them 
(iv 7-11, 14). The authenticity of the latter, as a whole, presents 
no great difficulty. But the Epistle to the Colossians should 
rather be referred to the beginning of the second century.
<P>
The Epistle to the Ephesians figures in Marcion's collection 
as the Epistle to the Laodiceans. Imitated, though in a manner 
more servile, from the Epistle to the Colossians, as the Second 
to Thessalonians was imitated from the First, it was probably 
presented originally as the letter to the Laodiceans mentioned 
in Colossians (iv, 16). [24] The style of this spurious Epistle is 
turbid and obscure. As to the foundation of it, the author replaces 
the cosmological and soteriological gnosis of Colossians by a 
gnosis which might be called mainly ecclesiological, integrating 
the myth of salvation by the Christ into his own myth of the 
Church. Since it was known to Marcion the composition goes 
back to the first third of the second century. [25]
<P>
Though of mediocre compass, the Epistle to the Philippians 
has the appearance of being a compilation of two letters. Towards 
the middle we find a clean cut, following on a vehement outburst 
against Judaism which recalls the fiery apology of Paul in Second 
Corinthians (iii, i-iv, i, 8-9). Moreover in the first part of the 
Epistle (ii, 25-30) we read that Epaphroditus, Paul's messenger 
to the Philippians, has just left the Apostle after being long at 
his side, while in the second part (iv, 18) we are told that this 
same Epaphroditus is just come to him, bringing the help for 
which Paul thanks the Philippians. Plain proof that the Epistle 
is a compilation made up of two short letters placed in inverted 
order, the first belonging approximately to 59, the second to 60. 
To the two letters thus brought together were added, about 
the beginning of the second century, certain elements of Christian 
gnosis and anti-Jewish polemic. [26]
<P>
<center><i>Pastoral Epistles</i></center>
<P>
The term "pastoral" is commonly applied to the two Epistles 
to Timothy and the Epistle to Titus on the ground that they are 
chiefly concerned with the institution of pastors and with church 
discipline. Conceived with the purpose of checking the growth
<P>
<center>28</center>
<P>
of gnosticism, they are much later than the apostolic age. It may
well be that these apocryphal compositions were not divulged 
in the communities till after the explosion of Marcion's heresy:
Timothy vi, 20 seems aimed directly at his Antitheses. As to 
their place of origin, the Roman souvenirs apparently contained 
in the Second to Timothy are not decisive for preferring Rome 
to the East. The hypothesis of short authentic letters embedded 
in a later commentary applies only to the Second (iv, 10-20) and 
is not exempt from question. Moreover the First does not seem 
to have been written continuously. [27] It is possible that a body 
of rules claiming to be apostolic has been drawn upon by the 
editor of our two Epistles, which probably have a common 
origin.
<P>
<center><i>Hebrews</i></center>
<P>
The Epistle "to the Hebrews" known in Rome at an early 
date, is earlier than the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians
which stands to it in a relation of dependence. [28] The attribution 
of the authorship to Paul, long unknown at Rome, seems to 
have been first made in Alexandria. Keeping the date commonly 
assigned to the letter of Clement (about 95) the Epistle to the 
Hebrews could not be later than 80. If the dates be postponed to 
the second century it would have to be admitted that the last 
two verses (xiii, 23-25) are a fictitious addition intended to 
support the attribution of the Epistle to Paul. In the same way 
the title "to the Hebrews" is no more than an ancient conjecture, 
perhaps originally connected with the said attribution. The 
attribution of authorship to Barnabas professed by Tertullian 
(<i>De Pudicitia</i>, 20), and perhaps current at Rome in his time, 
cannot be sustained, since the author places himself outside 
the apostolic age (ii, 3, 4). [29] A treatise rather than a letter, 
consisting of doctrinal and moral instruction, the document is 
addressed to a community of converted pagans nourished on 
the Old Testament as the only authorized scripture. [30] But the 
display of quotations serves only to support a Christian gnosis 
of salvation by the mediation of Christ, unique priest and victim, 
distinguished in express terms from the elementary catechesis 
in which the common teaching of Christianity was summed up 
(vi, 1-2). The conclusions which the author draws from the
<P>
<center>29</center>
<P>
Mosaic ritual are derived from texts, not from observances then 
flourishing, while the moral teaching is addressed to believers 
already tried by persecution and liable to lose their confidence 
in the mystery of salvation here presented as the true fulfilment 
of Jewish scripture. Earlier than the explosion of the gnostic 
crisis and the canonization of the Gospel, the Epistle is probably 
of Alexandrian origin.
<P>
Incidentally, this Epistle affords a striking example of the 
freedom with which primitive gnosis developed the conception 
of the Christ, and of its independence of what is commonly called 
the Gospel tradition. We find it especially in the parallel instituted 
in chapter vii between Melchisedec and Jesus, in which the 
Christ, without father or mother, without beginning or end of 
life in this world, "rose up," like a star—allusion to the star of 
Numbers xxiv, 17—"from Judah," whose descendant he 
certainly was not in the Gospel tradition.
<P>
<center><i>Peter and Jude</i></center>
<P>
The first of the Epistles named after Peter would be placed 
under the patronage of that apostle at a time when he had become 
recognized as the founder of the Roman community: it is a 
catechism or homily in which baptism is made much of, but 
with a theme of wider range than baptismal instruction. Rome 
is here spoken of under its mystic name of Babylon (v, 13) and 
perhaps the mention of Mark (v, 13) is intended to promote his 
claim to the authorship of the second Gospel. But this writing 
contains little sign of influence by Gospel tradition, the sole 
feature, on which the writer insists complacently, as though it 
were well known, being the descent of the Christ into hell 
(iii, 19-20; iv, 6), a feature hardly hinted at in the canonical 
Gospels. The document is almost contemporary with the Epistle 
to the Hebrews, but of Roman origin, at least in its canonical 
edition.
<P>
The second Epistle attributed to the same apostle is perceptibly 
of a later date. The central part of it (ii, iii) which corresponds 
with the Epistle of Jude, is an attack on the gnostic movement 
then in full life and vigour. In the preambles [31] it refers not, as 
commonly supposed, to the Gospel story of transfiguration, 
<P>
<center>30</center>
<P>
but to the Apocalypse of Peter—which we shall discuss later on. 
In the conclusion (iii, 15, 16) it mentions a collection of Paul's 
Epistles of which certain heretics are making abusive employment;
this doubtless is the collection of the ten Epistles known 
to Marcion. The Epistle therefore must be later than the birth 
of Marcionism and was most probably composed in the East,
about 150 at the earliest.
<P>
Apart from its superscription (1-2) and doxology (24-25),
the Epistle named after Jude embodies, in a form at least relatively 
primitive, the anti-gnostic writing, or fragment, which is paraphrased
in Second Peter. The original writing may be dated as 
far on as about 130, and its working up into an Epistle to 150. 
The relative antiquity of this composition appears in the quotations
from the Apocrypha, Enoch and the Assumption of Moses 
(14, 15 and 9), which Second Peter has not retained.
<P>
<center><i>James</i></center>
<P>
The so-called Epistle of James is a piece of simple moral 
instruction drawing its inspiration from a catechism rather 
Jewish than Christian. It makes a lively attack on the idea of 
faith without works which suggests that its editing took place 
before the time when the four Gospels, and the writings attributed 
to Paul, were advanced to canonical authority, that is, before 
150. [32] The fictitious address to the Twelve Tribes, which 
transforms a collection of moral maxims into an Epistle, is 
symbolic, like that of 1 Peter to the "dispersed" Jews of Asia 
Minor. A certain affinity in tone with the Pastor of Hermas 
suggests that its place of origin was Rome.
<P>
<center><i>John</i></center>
<P>
Of the three Epistles attributed to the apostle John, the first, 
like the Epistle to the Hebrews, does not affect the form of 
a letter. It consists of instruction, dogmatic and moral, perhaps 
originally founded on a rhythmical discourse like those found in 
the Fourth Gospel. The successive editions of the Epistle seem 
to have been co-ordinate with those of the Gospel itself; whence 
it would follow that the last edition, directed against gnosticism,
<P>
<center><i>31</i></center>
<P>
cannot be earlier than the middle of the second century. [33] This 
would also be the date of the two smaller Epistles, which have 
only the appearance of letters, the designation of the author 
being deliberately vague, as well as that of the recipients. The 
two were intended to act as convoy to the first in its final form, 
the second condemning the Docetic Christology, perhaps 
especially that of Marcion, while the third blasts those leaders 
of the community who oppose the Johannine writings. All 
three Epistles, like the fourth Gospel, were worked into their 
present form in Ephesian surroundings.
<P>
<center><i>Barnabas</i></center>
<P>
The Epistle "of Barnabas," also anonymous in itself, presents 
a certain analogy to the Epistle to the Hebrews, and must belong 
to nearly the same period, to a time, that is, when the Gospel 
legend was in process of formation. [34] The Epistle of Barnabas 
has no dependence on any of the canonical Epistles. In the 
moral part it reproduces instruction about the "two ways," the 
way of light and the way of darkness, a kind of Jewish catechism 
also made use of in the Didache. It was probably composed, 
therefore, at Alexandria in the first third of the second century.
<P>
<center><i>Clement</i></center>
<P>
Addressed in the name of "the community of God living in 
Rome to the community of God living in Corinth," the Epistle 
attributed to Clement is a long piece of moral teaching composed 
on the occasion of troubles which had broken out in the Corinthian
community and intended for their remedy. The document 
itself is one of the most authentic, but the date commonly assigned 
to it, about 95, seems open to question. Although it quotes the 
First to the Corinthians it is more indebted for its Christology 
to the Epistle to Hebrews than to Paul. It speaks of Peter and 
Paul as founders of the Roman Church, but seemingly more 
on the strength of the legend to that effect than of recent 
memories, [35] and conceives the organization of the communities 
after the pattern common to the Pastoral Epistles. An elder of 
the Roman community writing in 95, only some thirty years
<P>
<center>32</center>
<P>
after the persecution of Nero, could hardly have said that the 
disciples of Christ set out to preach everywhere immediately 
after the resurrection, instituting bishops and deacons and even 
laying down rules for their succession and life-long tenure of 
office. The indications rather are that the author of the letter is 
the Clement mentioned by Hermas and that he wrote towards
130-135.
<P>
Of different origin and less ancient date is the homily named
in tradition as the second Epistle of Clement. This composition 
presupposes a great development of the Gospel literature; some 
of its quotations appear to come from the so-called Gospel of 
the Egyptians. In all probability the homily is of Alexandrian 
origin and belongs to the second half, if not to the end, of the
second century.
<P>
<center><i>Ignatius and Polycarp</i></center>
<P>
The authenticity of the letters attributed to Ignatius of Antioch 
martyred under Trajan (98-117), was at one time strongly 
denied, then recognized, but has recently become the object of 
a new attack. The fact is that these letters lose their historical 
background if placed in the time of Trajan, since the seven in 
question inculcate a system of belief and discipline which correspond
to the conditions of the later period when the gnostic 
crisis was at its height. Moreover the Epistle of Polycarp to the 
Philippians seems to have been interpolated into the collection
of the Ignatian letters, by their author or editor, for the purpose 
of recommending them; this alone would seem to prove them 
apocryphal and later, at least in publication, than the death of 
Polycarp. Irenaeus quotes the Ignatian letter to the Romans, 
which we must suppose in existence about 170, but without 
naming the author whom he seems not to know as a quasi-apostolic
person connected with Polycarp. Neither can Polycarp's 
Epistle; when freed from its artificial attachment to the Ignatian 
letters, be dated in the reign of Trajan; it belongs to the last 
years of its author's life. [36] In this way we can explain this author's 
apparent knowledge of the collection of the thirteen Epistles 
of Paul, the Acts of the Apostles, First Peter, the synoptic 
tradition of Jesus' discourses, the Epistles of John and his reproval, 
without theological reasoning, of Marcion's Docetic gnosis
<P>
<center>33</center>
<P>
by utilizing 1 John iv, 2-3. The Johannine writings, whose 
existence we find him attesting, have but a very slight influence 
on his thought and style, which would be extremely surprising 
if the fourth Gospel were the work of an apostle or of an apostolic 
person of whom Polycarp himself is said to have been the 
disciple.
<P>
<center><i>The Didache</i></center>
<P>
Here it will be in place to call attention to the type of catechesis 
which has come down to us under the name of <i>Doctrine (Didache) 
of the Twelve Apostles</i>, a work of moral and disciplinary instruction 
highly esteemed in the first Christian age, which seems to have 
been composed in Syria or in Egypt at the beginning of the 
second century. As already pointed out, the moral part reproduces 
a body of Jewish teaching on "the two ways," eternal life and 
eternal death, intermingled with Gospel sentences corresponding 
to the tradition in Matthew. The second part has to do with 
baptism and the communion, the good order of assemblies and 
the choice of ministers, overseers (bishops) and deacons. The 
baptismal formula and the Lord's Prayer are identical with the 
canonical text of Matthew (vii, i; viii, 2). In the ordering of the 
communion the prophets have liberty to render thanks in their 
own terms (10), as an exercise outside the indicated formulas. 
From this we are led to assign a rather early date to the rule, 
seeing that, in the time of Justin, the Supper has a president 
who alone may pronounce the eucharistic prayers. The prayers 
of the <i>Didache</i>, moreover, do not give the impression that the 
Supper, as understood by the author, is the mystic commemoration
of the death of Christ indicated in First Corinthians and in 
the Gospels.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>2. THE CHRISTIAN APOCALYPSE</font></center>
<P>
The imminent return of Christ Jesus to the earth had been 
proclaimed for many years before the story was told, in oral 
preaching and in evangelical writings, of what in detail Jesus 
had done, taught and suffered before ascending into heaven to 
prepare the day of God. The Gospel was the announcement 
of this coming Day before it became an account of the Christ's 
teaching and of his saving death. For that reason the documents
<P>
<center>34</center>
<P>
of Christian apocalyptic will here be considered before we come 
to those of the literature known as "the Gospels."
<P>
Reference has already been made to the more or less considerable
elements of apocalyptic to be found in the epistolary, or 
rather catechical, literature we have just been considering, such 
as chapter xv of First Corinthians, the dissertation on the 
resurrection of the dead included in First Thessalonians 
(iv, i3-v, 11), and the central passage in Second (ii, 1-12). The 
<i>Didache</i>, the Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles, while containing 
no summary of the Gospel story, terminates in a short apocalypse 
closely related to the discourse on the end of the world common 
to the three Synoptics (16). And this discourse is itself the 
Christian adaptation of a Jewish apocalypse contemporary with 
the siege of Jerusalem by Titus. All that Christian apologetic 
did was to co-ordinate and interpret the elements of the Jewish 
apocalypse in application to the second coming of Jesus, impatiently
expected and always postponed, and this it did not 
only with the apocalypse current before the preaching of the 
Gospel but with that of later date, which uttered its last cries 
of anguish and hope amid the death throes of nationalist
Judaism. [37]
<P>
Thus it was that apocalyptic found its way into the Gospel 
tradition, which originally had no more of it than is contained in 
its general idea of the speedy coming of the Reign of God. But the 
Great Coming seeming ever to be further off, the delay was explained
as a providential ordering of events prophesied as due to 
happen first. Jewish eschatology and Jewish apocalyptic contained 
a rich mine of allusions, no better understood, and of predictions 
not yet fulfilled. All this was now regarded as due to happen 
before the Day of God and his Christ, "the sorrows" naturally 
preceding the "coming." The synoptic apocalypse accordingly 
marks out three stages, the beginning of the sorrows, the climax 
of the sorrows, and then the "end." They are expressly distinguished
in Mark xiii, 8, 14, 24.
<P>
The Apocalypse of John has the appearance of a methodical 
exposition of Jewish hopes interpreted in a Christian sense, and is 
conceived on the model of the Jewish apocalypses then current, 
which in turn professed to interpret ancient prophecies. In its 
groundwork the Johannine Apocalypse would seem to be a
<P>
<center>35</center>
<P>
compilation, but there is an almost mathematical regularity in its 
logical structure and literary arrangement. The traditional date of 
it is probably correct; it saw the light among the communities of 
Asia to which it was originally addressed, most likely at Ephesus 
towards the end of the first Christian century. The author was 
probably a Jewish Christian who had fled from Palestine during 
the Jewish war; certainly not the apostle John; nor can he have 
been "John the elder" known to Papias as a witness to the Gospel 
tradition. To that tradition the Apocalypse pays scant attention, 
knowing only that Christ, as the first to be raised up, is "the first-born of the dead" (i, 5, 18); incidentally it mentions that he was 
crucified at Jerusalem (xi, 8). Some time must have elapsed 
between the publication of the Apocalypse in the Asiatic communities by the act of the prophet himself and what may be called 
the final edition of it for general circulation throughout all the 
communities as an apostolic work by the same author as the 
fourth Gospel and the three Epistles. This identification and the 
constitution of the Johannine collection of books took place 
towards the middle of the second century.
<P>
The Apocalypse of Peter and the Pastor of Hermas are also 
books of Christian prophecy, which failed however to get 
admission into the collection of the New Testament. But mention 
must first be made of other writings more closely related to the 
Johannine Apocalypse. These are the Christian parts of the 
Ascension of Isaiah, the Christian oracles annexed to the Jewish 
Apocalypse called the Fourth Book of Esdras and the Christian 
elements in the Sibylline Books.
<P>
In the Ascension of Isaiah we can recognize three writings 
originally distinct, of which the oldest is the Jewish legend of the 
prophet's martyrdom under Manasseh. The other two are Christian.
The longer of these is an ecstatic vision of the Ascension of 
Isaiah to the seventh heaven in which he sees God and the Christ, 
"the Lord of all Glory," and hears the Most High dictate to the 
Christ the programme of his earthly manifestation and of his 
return. [38] The third piece, inserted into the legend of martyrdom, 
is a vision concerning the coming of Christ and of Antichrist, in 
which the resurrection of Jesus is described as in the Gospel of 
Peter and allusion made to Peter's martrydom in the persecution 
by Nero, who is Antichrist. The two Christian fragments are
<P>
<center>36</center>
<P>
relatively old, probably of the second century, the part attributed 
by both to the earthly life of Jesus being in harmony with the 
development of the Gospel literature. The author of the Ascension,
who knew the substance of Matthew's Gospel, may have been a 
Syrian and must have written between 130 and 150: the author 
of the other fragment is more recent and, in virtue of its almost 
certain dependence on the Gospel of Peter, cannot have been
written before 170-175.
<P>
Almost of the same date is the fragment of apocalypse represented
by the first two chapters of the Fourth Book of Esdras in 
editions of the Latin Bible, a self-contained prophecy originally in 
Greek, but, like the book of Hermas, composed in the West when 
Greek was still the liturgical and literary language of the Christian
communities. It consists of an indictment of the Jews and a 
vision of the eternal Jerusalem. The prophecy contained in the 
last two chapters of the same Book of Esdras is more recent and 
may have been originally conceived as an appendix to the book to 
which we find it annexed. It contains an exhortation to persecuted 
Christians which tells us almost nothing about the evolution of 
apocalyptic beliefs in the early Christian age.
<P>
The third of the Sibylline Books contains a Christian interpolation
set in a Jewish context. In this interpolation Beliar, or 
Satan-Antichrist, appears to be identified with Simon Magus. 
The eighth book, wholly Christian, was composed in the last 
years of Marcus Aurelius; like the Johannine Apocalypse, it 
centres round the Antichrist Nero. The Jewish Sibyl, in the 
fourth of the Books, written shortly after the eruption of Vesuvius
in 79, exhibits Nero, "the fugitive from Rome," crossing the 
Euphrates with a great army and goes on to speak of him in the 
fifth book. But in that book Nero is introduced as still a living 
man and in hiding among Parthians, whereas, in the Christian 
apocalyptic, Nero, still supported by the Parthians, and in the 
character of Antichrist, appears as a ghost or as risen from the 
dead.
<P>
Less ancient than these, the Apocalypse of Peter is also less 
preoccupied with revelation about the end of the world, and seems 
to aim rather at instructing believers as to the respective fates that
will fall after the judgment on the wicked and on the righteous. 
In its treatment of that topic it comes near not only to the Ascen- 
<P>
<center>37</center>
<P>
sion of Isaiah and the first two chapters of Fourth Esdras but also 
to the Egyptian mysteries and to the Orphic tradition. It is 
connected with the Gospel of Peter by the place it assigns to the 
cross in the second coming of the Lord. (In the Gospel the cross 
comes forth from the tomb behind the Christ as he rises from 
the dead; in the Apocalypse Jesus says that the cross will go 
before him when he comes in his glory.) In the Second Epistle of 
Peter formal reference is made to the Apocalypse in the opening 
chapter. It is therefore earlier than 150, and perhaps was written 
about 135. A Greek fragment of the apocalypse, with a passage 
from Enoch and a part of the Gospel of Peter, was found at 
Akhmim in Egypt, while the whole text, perhaps a little touched 
up and interpolated, has been preserved in an Ethiopian version. [39]
<P>
The scene depicted in this apocalypse presents the critic of the 
New Testament with a problem that demands the most careful 
handling. Jesus, having risen from the dead, is on the Mount of 
Olives with his disciples who question him about his second 
coming and the end of the world; Jesus answers by a short discourse
which corresponds to the synoptic apocalypse, especially 
to Luke xvii, 20-27, and to the preliminaries of the Ascension as 
told in Acts; the discourse finishes with an allegorical declaration 
connected with the fig tree; on the request of Peter, Jesus comments
on what he has just said by a paraphrase, not of the comparison
with a fig tree in the synoptic apocalypse (Mark xiii, 28;
Luke xxi, 29-30), but of the parable of the barren fig tree in Luke 
xiii, 6-9; the tree which must be cut down is Judaism with a false 
Jewish Messiah, a persecutor of Christians—probably Barkochba—whom
the two messengers of God, Enoch and Elias, will unmask;
follows a description of the Second Coming and the Last Judgment; the Christ then reveals to Peter in great detail how the 
wicked will be punished after the judgment; [40] the elect will be 
witnesses of their chastisements and will be able to obtain from the 
Lord pardon for those among the damned whom they have 
known; [41] Peter is then warned of the fate that awaits him in the 
capital of the West; finally Jesus and his disciples repair to the 
holy mountain [42] where two luminous beings, Moses and Elias, 
make their appearance; on Peter asking where the patriarchs are, 
Jesus causes him to behold the dwelling place of the blessed;
Peter then declares his intention to set up three tents, for Jesus,
<P>
<center>38</center>
<P>
Moses and Elias, for which the Christ rebukes him severely (in 
terms corresponding to Mark viii, 33); whereupon the voice of the 
Father is heard saying "this is my beloved son in whom I am well 
pleased"; a bright cloud envelopes Jesus, Moses and Elias, who 
are carried to heaven in the cloud; the heavens open to receive 
them, and then close; the disciples descend the mountain "praising 
God who has written the names of the righteous in the book of 
life in heaven."
<P>
Here then we have gathered into one picture the transfiguration
of Jesus and the apocalyptic discourse reported in the first 
three Gospels (Mark xiii; Matthew xxiv; Luke xxi), together with 
the scene of the Ascension described in Acts, not to mention the 
prediction of Peter's martyrdom found in the Fourth Gospel. 
The problem to be solved by the critic is this; how was pseudo-Peter
able to dispose, apparently at his own will, of elements 
utilized in a manner so different by the Gospel tradition and the 
Acts of the Apostles? Perhaps we may answer that the arrangement
of elements in the Apocalypse of Peter is no more arbitrary 
than that to be found in the canonical writings. The apocalyptic 
discourse in Mark is an extract brought in from elsewhere and 
substituted for another conclusion to the Jerusalem ministry—the
parable of the Wicked Husbandmen, originally conceived as 
the end of Jesus' teaching in Jerusalem. The discourse itself may 
very well have been drawn up at first in the form of a revelation 
made by the Christ after rising from the dead, a hypothesis 
supported by the preamble to the Ascension in Acts (i, 6-8). 
In the same way it has long been suspected that the transfiguration
of Jesus was originally a manifestation of the risen Christ 
which Mark has thrown back into the Galilean ministry. [43] What 
may be taken as certain is that, before the canonization of the 
New Testament, a great liberty was used in the dealings of 
tradition with the manifold material at its disposal for constructing
the legend of Jesus and his ministry—material messianic, 
eschatological, apocalyptic and theosophic. The Apocalypse of 
Peter belongs to this precanonical age when the literature of the 
Christian religion had no stereotyped form, the religion itself 
being still amorphous; Marcion had not yet become active and 
the reaction against him and against gnosticism in general had yet 
to come.  It is moreover evident that the second Epistle of Peter,
<P>
<center>39</center>
<P>
in all it says about the revelation made to Peter on the mountain 
about the glory of the Christ (i, 12-19), is not based on the story 
of the transfiguration as told in the Synoptics, nor on Acts for 
what it says of the Ascension, nor on the Fourth Gospel for the 
prediction of the apostle's death, but entirely and exclusively on 
our apocryphal book. This book seems to have been written 
at Alexandria and Clement was making great use of it in 
135, citing it largely in his <i>Hypolyposes</i>. Be it noted that 
Alexandria, towards 135, was using its Gospel of the Egyptians. 
Our pseudo-Peter in writing his apocalypse would therefore be 
unrestrained in breaking up and arranging at his pleasure a mass of 
material which the canonical Gospels and Acts arranged in a 
different pattern. We can well understand why in the process of 
definitely canonizing the Gospels and Acts, there would be no 
long delay in excluding a document which doubled their stories 
and contradicted them too plainly. We may note, however, 
that towards the year 200 Rome still kept the Apocalypse of Peter 
in its collection of the Scriptures, although there were some who 
contested it, along with the Apocalypse of John (Canon of 
Muratori).
<P>
<center><i>Hermas</i></center>
<P>
Hermas lived at Rome during the first half and wrote in the 
second quarter of the second century. [44] The tradition of the 
Roman community made him a brother of the bishop Pius; the 
rest of our knowledge of him is derived from what he says of 
himself in his book. He was not without learning, but is generally 
not regarded as a man of genius. Like the Apocalypse of John, but 
with fewer repetitions and incoherences, his book has an almost 
mathematical arrangement. It is divided into three: visions, to 
the number of four; commandments, to the number of twelve;
similitudes or parables, to the number of eight—the ninth being a 
summary of what has been said in the visions, and the tenth 
serving for conclusions. The whole book has the character of a 
vision, both the precepts and the parables being dictated or shown 
to Hermas by an angel garbed as a shepherd. The significance of 
the book of Hermas lies chiefly in its relation to the history of
Christian discipline. 
<P>
To the Epistles attributed to Paul, the Epistle to the Hebrews
<P>
<center>40</center>
<P>
and the first Epistle of John, the idea of the Christian as a sinner is 
repugnant; they regard baptism as a final regeneration by means of 
which the saints acquire at once the sinlessness of the redeemed. 
But as the parousia came not and the Church continued its life, the 
question of the Christian sinner began to present itself and became 
urgent. Hermas, inspired to declare that God will give pardon, 
once but no more, to the Christian who has sinned gravely after 
his baptism, was the first to administer a corrective to the notion 
that the believer became the unconditional heir of immortality on 
undergoing the rite of Christian initiation. What we encounter in 
Hermas is no longer a vision of the Eternal Jerusalem ready to 
come down to earth, but the church in process of organizing 
itself on earth. The prophet, confronted with growing abuses, 
here sets out to bring them remedy by giving utterance first to the 
angel of the Church itself, and then to the mystical Shepherd
changed into an angel of penitence. [45]
<P>
In his knowledge of the Gospel tradition Hermas seems little
better informed than the author of the Johannine Apocalypse or 
Clement of Rome who, as mentioned above, was probably a 
contemporary of Hermas and identical with the person named in 
his Vision (ii, 4). With some of the Gospel writings he was certainly
acquainted; on occasion he is inspired by their sayings 
and he consciously imitates the parables. But it cannot be said that 
the Gospel legend was his favourite theme of meditation. The 
salvation-myth he reduces to its simplest form of expression. All 
the evidence points to the conclusion that the outbreak of the 
gnostic crisis, with its lawless flood of speculation and fiction, 
compelled the church to go back on its steps, to sift its archives, 
to catalogue and guarantee them and to define the right faith. 
Hermas brings us to the eve of that decision, which he did not
foresee and which finally was to turn against him.
<P>
About half a century after Hermas the author of the Canon of 
Muratori expounded and defended the New Testament catalogue 
of the Roman Church. Having closed the list with the Apocalypses
of John and of Peter, and before mentioning the works of 
the heretics reproved by the Church, he wrote as follows: "As to 
the Pastor, it was written recently in our time at Rome by Hermas, 
his brother the bishop then occupying the chair of the Roman 
community. Therefore we ought indeed to read it"—for private
<P>
<center>41</center>
<P>
edification—"but it may not be publicly read to the people in the 
church"—because it would be held of no account—"nor among 
the prophets, of which the number is complete"—the prophets 
of the Old Testament of whom the full list was long since 
established—"nor among the apostles, to the end of the ages"— 
Hermas not having been an apostle nor one of their disciples as 
the author believed the New Testament writers to have been. 
We may read between the lines that the Pastor had for some 
time figured on the margin of the apostolic collection and that the 
reaction against the Montanists may have done him as much harm 
in Rome as did the definition of the Canon in opposition to the 
gnostics. In the fourth century the book was still used for public 
reading by congregations in the East, but only for the instruction 
of catechumens and without decisive authority in matters of faith.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>3. GOSPELS AND ACTS</font></center>
<P>
The four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are traditionally 
regarded as the most important part of the New Testament. On 
first inspection they would seem to contain the history of the very 
beginnings of the Christian religion. Nevertheless they are far 
from being books of history proper, far from having been 
originally conceived by their authors as history, or selected by the 
Church, from among many other writings of similar character, on
account of their historical value.
<P>
A distinction has to be made between <i>the</i> Gospel and the 
Gospel<i>s</i>. The word "Gospel" in the New Testament is not a 
name given to <i>books</i> about the life and death of Jesus; it signifies 
"the good news," that is, the message of salvation won by the 
Christ. Even in our canonical Gospels the word is applied to this 
salvation, as made real by Jesus, and not to what seems to have 
been the theme of his preaching, the theme, namely, of the imminent
coming of the Reign of God and the need of repentance 
for those who would share in its blessedness. In the end "Gospel" 
came to refer to the life and teachings of Jesus, but only so far as 
the life and the teachings were integral parts of the saving work 
which reached its climax, so to say, in the death and resurrection 
of the Christ. Moreover, when the word came to be applied to a 
plurality of books, the fact that only <i>one</i> Gospel was involved,
<P>
<center>42</center>
<P>
or had ever existed, -was indicated in the titles used to denote their 
authors, which titles ran, not the Gospel <i>of</i> Matthew or <i>of</i> Mark 
but <i>according to</i> Matthew and <i>according to</i> Mark. This "according 
to" implied no doubt or attenuation of the authorship attributed 
to the book. As expressly stated by Irenaeus {<i>Heresies</i>, iii, 1) it was 
intended to emphasize the oneness of the Gospel under the four 
authorized forms of its text. Each of the communities began the 
use of books with one short book only; this, for the community 
using it, was "the Gospel." Many of the gnostic sects, Marcion's
for example, did the same.
<P>
Justin is the oldest author to employ the word "Gospels" in the
plural, to designate the books of the Good News; [46] their use in 
liturgical reading would lead to them being so named. The oldest 
author to affirm that there were four, and only four books so 
authorized, is Irenaeus. [47] The tone he assumes leaves no doubt as 
to the unique and exclusive authority of these writings; but the 
insistence displayed both by him and by the author of the Canon 
of Muratori in defending their authority rouses a suspicion that 
the fixing of the fourfold collection was not so primitive nor so 
natural as their tone of assurance might suggest to the incautious
reader.
<P>
From our examination of the epistolary and apocalyptic
literature it seems that the Gospel literature did not acquire 
importance till after the close of the first century. It is evident, 
moreover, that the legend of Jesus and the tradition of his 
teaching were not fixed at the outset of the Christian movement, 
and that for a long time the writings to which they were consigned 
continued to be produced without much restraint and without 
being authorized or commended otherwise than by their content. 
It is also certain that the practice began at an early date of putting 
forward, under the name of the Christ, teaching about the end of 
the world which had been borrowed from the apocalyptic 
tradition of Judaism; and, further, that many a lesson reflecting 
the needs of the infant communities or their propaganda was 
ascribed to him, together with revelations about his own transcendent
personality and mission. By the visionary and fervid 
temper of the first generations acquisitions of all kinds were made 
easy. The imagination of the believer was constantly in search of 
anything which would exalt the Christ beyond comparison with
<P>
<center>43</center>
<P>
the pagan gods and leave no doubt as to his relations to Judaism, 
whose sacred books it turned into witnesses to Jesus. There is no 
difficulty in perceiving, in the documents of primitive Christianity
how theories of salvation, mystical interpretations of the 
messianic role attributed from the first to Jesus, though not 
logically deduced from the Scriptures, were artificially supported 
by them, and how even the legend of the Christ was similarly 
constructed by attaching it to messianic texts, real or supposed, in 
the Old Testament. We can understand how, under these conditions,
Gospel writings began to multiply from an early date. 
They would have continued to multiply indefinitely had not the 
Church laid down a rule in the matter.
<P>
It is, however, important to remark that the use of these books 
by congregations in meetings for worship tended to fix their 
theme and give authority to certain writings. The Gospels when 
closely examined are far less the echoes of a tradition zealous to 
keep intact the memories of Jesus than a didactic instrument, we 
might even say, a catechism of the worship rendered to the Lord 
Christ. Those which the Church decided to retain are small books, 
very sober in style, not overcharged with matter but made up of 
selected elements, of stories brief and full of meaning, of teachings 
concise and sententious. Two cycles, or centres, are discernible, 
the cycle of the preaching in Galilee and the cycle of the passion in 
Jerusalem; the instruction of catechumens and the revelation of a 
mystery; the baptismal catechism and the eucharistic. The whole 
is thus brought into co-ordination with the great rites of Christian 
initiation and with the Christian mystery. It is no effect of chance 
that the Fourth Gospel, in the story of the passion as given in its 
source document, is found to justify the Easter observance of the 
"quartodeciman" congregations of Asia, while the first three 
conform to the common practice of Sunday observance ordained 
by the Roman Church. Our Gospels were originally conceived as 
ritual books for both observances, and were subsequently corrected 
at a few points to cover up the difference between them on this. 
Their literary form, their liturgical and oracular style, are in 
keeping with the purpose they are intended to serve. The question 
of the New Testament style is still under examination. It is certain 
that the discourses in the Gospels, even those in the fourth, were 
originally short writings composed in the rhythmic form peculiar
<P>
<center>44</center>
<P>
to the poetic writings of the Old Testament, Psalms, Proverbs 
and the discourses in Job. It is equally certain that some parts at 
least of the Epistles and the entire Apocalypse were put out at 
first in rhythmic form. The same may well be true of the Gospel 
stories.
<P>
Both the history and the fortunes of the Gospels are thus 
explained. Originally they were anonymous writings belonging to 
the communities which used them. The third Gospel seems an 
exception, offering itself to the reader as a personal work and 
with a dedicatory preface in the form then customary with 
profane writers. But this laicization of the Gospel theme hardly 
goes beyond the preface; moreover the editorial elaboration of 
Luke and Acts reduces them to the common level of biblical 
historiography. At the height of the gnostic crisis Marcion,
opposing the common Christianity with a Gospel which, according
to him, was the one Gospel and the only true, depersonalized 
Luke and further lightened it of everything that he found of 
Judaizing tendency. Then it was that the Church replied by 
canonizing the Gospels most in honour among the chief communities,
disdaining the others and setting them aside, especially 
those which the gnostic themselves had fabricated or arranged. 
The reason why the Church did not limit its choice to one 
Gospel and only one, as Marcion had done, probably lay in the 
fact that the canon of the four Gospels resulted from a compromise
between the influential communities. These came more 
easily to agreement in mutual recognition of the texts they were 
severally familiar with than they would have done in elaborating 
a single Gospel and securing its acceptance by them all.
<P>
As to what followed, there can be little doubt that the canonization
of the four Gospels as traditional provided the occasion 
for some retouchings of their already edited text. It may well 
have had the further effect of giving consistency to the attribution 
of authorship, by means of which it was hoped to render indisputable
a number of books which, in reality, did not come 
directly from any apostle, and in which the faith, aspirations 
and prophetic genius of the first Christian generations chiefly 
found utterance. The statements of John the Elder, reported 
by Papias of Hierapolis, in regard to Mark and Matthew, were 
put into words, at the very time when the canonization of the
<P>
<center>45</center>
<P>
Gospels was under consideration, with the object of guaranteeing 
the application of the apostolic names to writings for whose 
authority that form of recommendation was judged to be 
indispensable. The situation these statements were intended to 
justify was one of fact and of right; of fact, in respect of the 
credit already acquired by the writings in question; of right, in 
respect of the eminent authority that had to be given to books 
about whose origin little was known, or whose real origin 
would not have sustained their prestige at a sufficient height. 
The fiction of apostolic origin was a necessity for Christian 
apologetic when at grips with gnosticism. The fixation of the 
canon, to which the apostolic fiction was linked, was itself 
a necessity for the same reason—as the argument of the Canon 
of Muratori in regard to Hermas has already shown us. The 
fiction is without bearing on the history of the composition of 
the Gospels, except at the final stage of that history and in regard 
to the revision of their text in the process of forming them into 
a canonized group.
<P>
The Gospel attributed to Mark, generally regarded as the 
oldest of the Four, [48] is a shortened manual of Christian catechesis, 
not all of one piece and not exempt from retouchings. The 
last of these consisted in the adding of a conclusion (xvi, 9-20) 
perhaps as recent as the middle of the second century. [49] The 
basis of Mark seems to have been a document which agreed 
with John in the date of the passion, that is to say, in implying 
the coincidence of the Christian with the Jewish Passover. [50] 
This document has been worked over and surcharged, one part 
of the alterations betraying the influence of Pauline tendencies 
and doctrines while others [51] reveal the knowledge of didactic 
elements expanded in Matthew and Luke and readjustment of 
tne passion stories to adapt them to the practice of the Sunday 
Easter. The date of the fundamental document may be earlier 
than the year 70; the subsequent editorial revision is later than 
the fall of Jerusalem. The final editings of Luke and of Matthew 
are founded on Mark as it stands, minus the deuterocanonical 
conclusion. After the discovery of the empty tomb, which these 
Gospels take from Mark, their editors artificially introduce 
completely divergent stories of apparitions of the risen Jesus. 
Both of them agree in loosening the tongues of the women
<P>
<center>46</center>
<P>
whom the editor of Mark (xvi, 8) expressly makes silent, because 
he was aware that his story of the empty tomb had been unheard 
of till he told it. This compromising feature in Mark is redressed 
in Matthew xxviii, 8 and in Luke xxiv, 10-11; but what the two 
evangelists go on to relate on their own responsibility is no less 
freely invented and put together than the story of the empty 
tomb.
<P>
Mark seems to have been a Roman Gospel of ancient date. [52] 
Its attribution to Mark possibly coincides with the final revision 
of the book and the introduction of the Sunday Easter, when 
the Roman community ceased to celebrate the festival of salvation 
on the same day as the Jews. This would be some time before 
150-160, when Pope Anicetus was able to cite the tradition of 
his predecessors in opposing Polycarp on the question of 
Easter Day. [53] Disparaging references to the Galilean apostles 
found in Mark are the following: Peter's lack of intelligence, 
viii, 32, 33; his ridiculous remark, ix, 5-6; ill-judged demand 
of the sons of Zebedee, x, 35-40; Peter's boasting and denial, 
xiv, 29-31, 54, 66-72; pitiful attitude of Peter, James and John 
at Gethsemane. On this we may remark, but only by way of 
a probable hypothesis, that the revision of Mark thus characterized 
by ill will to these apostles was the work of parties in Rome 
devoted to the memory of Paul, and was finally adopted, with 
the observance of the Sunday Easter, when the Roman community 
became united towards the beginning of the second century. 
But the dependence of the other Gospel writings, notably 
Matthew, revised in the East, on a document of this nature, is 
enough to prove the original poverty of what we are accustomed 
to call the Gospel tradition.
<P>
The first of our canonical Gospels seems to have circulated 
to begin with among the hellenic-christian congregations in 
Syria and Palestine. The narrative parts are mainly founded on 
Mark, what is added to them being secondary fiction with 
apologetic bearings and sometimes romantically conceived, as 
in the role attributed to Pilate's wife in the story of the passion 
(xxvii, 19). The birth-stories belong to the order of mythical 
fictions and are studiously elaborated in connexion with texts 
from the prophets (i, ii). The idea of conception by the Holy 
Spirit, notwithstanding its superficial resemblance to Isaiah
<P>
<center>47</center>
<P>
vii, 14, 1s thoroughly pagan; if it first saw the light in Jewish-Christian
circles, they must have been considerably paganized. 
These birth-stories, however, seem to have come into the text 
at the last revision of the Gospel, and in any case proclaim 
themselves clearly enough to be adventitious. The special 
interest of the Gospel, to which it owed its high credit among 
the early communities, lies in the place it gives to discourses 
attributed to Jesus, a mass of teachings not without Jewish-Christian
features and bearing, in the total, the mark of their 
Jewish origin, but adapted under revision to the spirit of universal 
Christianity. As the greater part of these teachings are repeated 
in the third Gospel, with variations which affect only their 
literary form, critics generally admit the dependence of Matthew 
and Luke, for the discourses, on a common source, but in two 
different versions both derived from a Semitic original of 
relatively ancient date. But the evangelical matter in Matthew, 
so far as it consists of teachings, does not represent a single 
collection of memories faithfully preserved from the apostolic 
age, any more than its narratives represent the legend of Jesus 
preserved in the same way. It contains rather a series of acquisitions
successively taken over under the pressure of circumstance, 
of the progressive needs of Christian propaganda, and as required 
by the organization of Christian teaching in the communities. 
The original document was a <i>Didache</i> (a "teaching") afterwards 
worked up into a Gospel of the canonical type by amalgamation 
with Mark. The importance attached to the person of Peter, 
notably in xvi, 13-20, derives from the fact that this Gospel took 
form in Jewish-Christian circles with a turn for universalism. The 
same is true of the Peter-legend developed in the first part of Acts.
<P>
In the traditional form it now has, the first Gospel cannot 
be much earlier than the year 125, a date somewhat movable, 
like all those here indicated for the Gospels, since retouches 
were always possible up to the final canonization of the books 
and of their official text. There is no doubt that it existed before 
Justin and was known in Asia, as Mark also was, in the time of 
Papias. We are much in the dark as to the reasons for its being 
attributed to the apostle Matthew; we may recall what has been 
said above of the originally anonymous character of the Gospel 
revisions. The substitution of the name Matthew for Levi in
<P>
<center>48</center>
<P>
the story of the calling of the publican (ix, 9) must be connected 
with this attribution; but, if the intention is clear, the motive 
is not. By a forced interpretation of the evidence of Papias, 
often adopted since Schleiermacher, but open to question at 
every point, it has been supposed that the Gospel was judged 
to be the work of Matthew because this apostle had composed 
the collection of discourses which is one of its chief sources. 
But that collection was an impersonal work and not apostolic. [54] 
Some apostolic name had to be chosen to give authority to the 
Gospel: the reason for the choice of Matthew the publican lying 
perhaps in some legend about him which made him a reciter of 
the Gospel.
<P>
The writings of Luke present another enigma. The preface 
to the third Gospel and that of Acts [55] show that the two books 
were originally the first and second parts of one work which 
professed to be composed under conditions common to the 
issue of books in that time, with a dedication to some eminent 
personage. But the preface to Acts has been mutilated, the first 
stage in a process of alteration which seems to have been extended 
to the whole of the original document; the first part, or Gospel, 
was apparently recast and completed in a similar manner. It 
seems impossible to admit the view that the author of this, the 
original, document was the person who writes "we" in certain 
narratives in Acts, and who is to be identified with Luke the 
companion of Paul, and that this man, arriving in Rome with 
Paul about the year 60, wrote the story of Christian origins 
about the year 80. The author of the general preface (Luke i, 1-4) 
does not place himself among the companions and disciples of 
the apostles; the underlying idea of his preface is that of an 
apostolic tradition transmitted in good order down to the time 
of those, who, like himself, have undertaken to describe the 
institution of the Christian faith. And the writings said to be 
Luke's, taken in the form in which they have come down to us, 
cannot go back to the apostolic age, nor even to the end of the 
first century; they are the prelude to the age of Christian apologetic
as practised by Athenagoras and Justin. This Gospel, 
moreover, is no longer the mixed catechesis of Mark and Matthew, 
nor is it the gnosis of John. But Luke and Acts are earlier than
140, since Marcion, excommunicated from the Roman church
<P>
<center>49</center>
<P>
about 144, furnished his sect with our third Gospel as an authorized
version, with the matter omitted that conflicted with the 
heresiarch's system. The contrary hypothesis, which makes 
Marcion's Luke the original and our canonical Gospel the 
derivative, is indefensible. Marcion took the Gospel used by the 
Roman Church and adapted it in conformity with the needs of his 
doctrine. In this procedure he took no greater liberty, in principle, 
than the editors of our Gospel texts were wont to allow themselves.
<P>
Luke is a compilation analogous to Mark and Matthew and 
like them intended for reading aloud in the assemblies. Here 
again Mark has furnished most of the stories in the body of the 
book; what does not come from Mark is legendary fiction or 
mythical construction; examples of these are the preaching of 
Jesus at Nazareth (iv, 16-30), the mission of the seventy-two 
disciples (x, i-12), [56] the ascension of the risen Christ (xxiv, 
50-53). [57] The birth-stories, though not constructed all at once, 
are better put together than in Matthew, but with as little basis 
in tradition; though not independent of ancient prophecy they 
are not constructed on texts for the purpose of showing their 
fulfilment. The idea of virgin conception (i, 34-35) is adventitious;
it is only in their source that the stories are of earlier date 
than Matthew's. The evangelical teachings are as abundant as 
in Matthew but more dispersed. Certain parables, of deeply 
moving character—the Rich Man and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son, 
the Pharisee and the Publican and others—are peculiar to Luke, 
where they represent an original development of tradition. By 
an almost mechanical device of editing the greater part of the 
discourses attributed to Jesus are lodged between the departure
of the Christ for Jerusalem and his arrival in Judea (ix, 51-xviii, 14).
The explanation is that the sayings and parables 
having no attachment to time and place in the traditional souvenirs, 
the evangelists inserted them as best they could in the course 
of the narratives, Matthew preferring an arrangement in long 
discourses and Luke in distributed pieces.
<P>
<center><i>The Acts of the Apostles</i></center>
<P>
This book, in the form it now has, is an amalgamation of 
primitive data concerning the beginnings of Christian preaching
<P>
<center>50</center>
<P>
and the missions of Paul with mythical and legendary notions, 
and discourses artificially composed in the manner of ancient 
historiography. Anti-Jewish polemic, perceptible in all the 
Gospels, is here outstandingly tendentious, the author having 
set himself the task of proving that Christianity is the most 
authentic form of Judaism and has the right, in that capacity, 
to the same tolerance by Roman authority as that enjoyed by 
official Judaism. Peter and Paul are in the forefront of evangelical 
activity, and it would seem that the author has taxed his wits to 
furnish them with the same miracles; each brings a dead person 
to life, cures a paralytic and performs miscellaneous miracles, 
the one with his shadow, the other with aprons snatched from 
his body. But, in all this, Paul is given second place to the elder 
apostles, especially to Peter whom we find taking the lead in 
preaching to the Gentiles (x-xi, 18); while every trace of old 
disputes and rivalries between them is carefully obliterated, 
and the presentation of the primitive history dominated throughout
by the fictitious idea of an apostolic tradition originally
guarded by the Twelve.
<P>
Both the Gospels and Acts acquired their final form in the
first half of the second century—a conclusion which may be 
taken as guaranteed by the proceedings of Marcion and by 
the apologist Justin's employment of the third Gospel. The 
first book "to Theophilus" became, in revision, a cult-book 
impersonalized and enriched with the latest acquisitions of the 
faith, while the passion and resurrection stories were retouched 
and augmented, not only for the demonstration of the Christian 
message, but to adapt the stories to the Easter usage of the 
Roman congregation. On the latter point the revision of the 
third Gospel, like that of the first, was conformed to the revision 
of the second and then brought to the point by stories of the 
resurrection which bring the Sunday Easter into plain relief. [58] 
"While the systematic preoccupation with prophecy betrays 
a development of Christian belief and apologetic in presence 
of Judaism and in opposition to it, it is not impossible that the 
ardour for the Old Testament apparent in Luke and Acts attest 
a reaction against those gnostics who, like Marcion and Basilides 
before him, repudiated the Old Testament and the God of the 
Jews. We have still stronger grounds for supposing that the
<P>
<center>51</center>
<P>
materialization of the apparitions of the risen Christ, both in 
the Gospel and in Acts, is aimed at destroying the influence of 
the Docetism which denied his material existence, but of which 
Marcion was not the initiator. It should not be overlooked that, 
alone among the New Testament writers, the editor of Luke 
and Acts has had the hardihood to represent the risen Christ 
as eating material food (Luke xxiv, 42; Acts x, 41) and as remaining 
among his followers for a longish period afterwards, as some of 
the gnostics also did. It remains to be said that the dependence 
of certain passages in Luke and Acts on the so-called Johannine 
tradition and on the fourth Gospel, [59] in the revision of which 
the aim at Docetic gnosticism is equally apparent, invites us 
to place the canonical revision of our two books near the time 
when the group of four Gospels was canonized as a whole.
<P>
Wherever they were composed, the third Gospel and Acts 
reflect the development of Christian faith and institution between 
the years 125 and 150. The two books were prepared and revised 
in a great centre of Christianity which also undertook their 
general diffusion. The Roman Church itself had perhaps promoted 
their last revision for the purpose of admitting them into its 
collection of the Scriptures, and therefore knew what it was 
about in admitting them. We can easily understand how 
this Church found the Gospel of Mark, which it already had, 
inadequate for Christian instruction; and how the original work 
of Luke failed to make good the inadequacy. For neither Mark, 
nor, probably, Luke's original related the birth of the Christ;
moreover, they lacked the greater part of the sayings which 
were circulating among the communities at the opening of the 
second century as discourses of Jesus.
<P>
<center><i>The Fourth Gospel</i></center>
<P>
In the matter forming its groundwork the Fourth Gospel is 
of later date than the three Synoptics and would seem to have 
been conceived in another setting and on a different pattern. 
Perhaps, however, in its original form, the frame was not very
different, though the Gospel was wholely unlike the others in 
spirit and doctrine. Towards the end of the first century there 
appeared at Ephesus, perhaps from Syria, a mystical prophet,
<P>
<center>52</center>
<P>
a master of Christian gnosis rather than a preacher of the Gospel, 
who conceived and gave form to the sublime discourses and the 
symbolic visions on which the Gospel was finally built up—the 
style of the discourses being rhythmic, like that of the sayings and 
sentences in the Synoptics, but the development of the thought 
more spacious and the themes perceptibly different. [60] But the 
mystic Christ of our prophet not being born of the flesh, and 
his gift to those who were his being simply that of immortal 
life, it soon became necessary to conform his figure to the Christ 
of the common tradition in whom the Jewish prophecies were 
fulfilled and who was soon to appear in his Kingdom and raise 
the dead from their graves. Had not the Apocalypse, conceived 
in that strain, just been published at this same Ephesus? Two 
chief stages can be distinguished in the literary formation of 
this Gospel: a first official edition, about 135-140, ended by the 
present conclusion of chapter xx, and characterized by the 
greater part of the borrowings from the Synoptic tradition and 
by passages specially conceived to effect the adjustment, probably 
also by the fixation of the chronological framework and distribu- 
tion of the material in accordance with it; [61] then a second edition, 
the canonical, about 150-160, almost contemporary with the 
last editions of Matthew and Luke. [62] In this second edition 
chapter xxi is the piece most easily recognizable as a newcomer;
but various retouchings and further additions may have been 
made in the body of the book, notably in regard to the beloved 
disciple, who is given a prominence of his own as author of the 
book at the same time as he was being proclaimed the author 
of the Apocalypse and an apostle of the Lord Jesus. The object 
aimed at in this edition seems to have been precisely that of 
procuring the inclusion of the book in the authorized group 
of Gospels by making it acceptable to the community which 
apparently had the leading part in fixing the New Testament 
Canon, to wit, the Roman. It may be said, for example, that 
chapter xxi was added to make good the legend of Peter as 
chief shepherd of Christ's sheep, by harmonizing it, as well as 
might be, with the fiction of the beloved disciple. But it is important
to note that during the Montanist crisis towards the end
of the second century, in the time of Irenaeus, the canonization 
of the fourth gospel had opponents. Not only does Irenaeus
<P>
<center>53</center>
<P>
mention them in <i>Heresies</i> (iii, 11, 9) but finds it necessary to 
condemn them at the end of his <i>Exposition of Apostolic Preaching</i>.
<P>
The fourth Gospel agrees with the Easter usage of the "Quartodecimans"
who celebrated Passover on the same day as the Jews. 
Their Passover was the festival of a beneficial death, the 
Christ being thought to have died at the hour when the lamb 
of the Jewish festival was sacrificed. This being certainly the 
primitive custom, and implied in the foundation documents of 
Mark and Luke, we are bound to conclude that our Gospel 
supplanted one of the others, Luke probably, in Ephesian usage, 
and in a form not yet adapted to the Sunday observance of 
Easter, though doubtless the adaptation had by this time already 
been made in Rome. When the Easter controversy broke out 
about the year 190 the Roman party did not perceive, or pretended
not to perceive, that while the Synoptics, in their last 
edition, were now supporting the common Sunday observance, 
the fourth Gospel fully authorized the other, the Asiatic 
observance. In what followed the discord on this point was at 
last covered up under borrowings made by the editors of John 
from the last edition of the Synoptics, notably those taken from 
the narrative which fix the passion on Friday and the resurrection 
on the following Sunday. The discord remains none the less, 
and the ill-disguised contradiction would be enough to prove 
that the Gospels are, before all else, a catechism of Christian 
initiation. It shows that even in their most important part, and 
the part historically the best guaranteed in the essential datum, 
namely the crucifixion of Jesus, we have clearly the wording of 
a liturgical drama, rather than a record of accurate memories 
of the facts commemorated in the liturgy.
<P>
<center><font size=+1>THE NON-CANONICAL LITERATURE</font></center>
<P>
In the period when effort was being made to fix the canon of 
the New Testament, other Gospels and even other Acts of the 
Apostles, less recommended by church usage, if not positively 
disqualified by heretical origin or flavour, were offered for the 
edification of the communities. A certain number of these 
writings are known to us only by their titles or in fragments, 
catholic tradition having either neglected or suppressed them.
<P>
<center>54</center>
<P>
Some nevertheless exercised an appreciable influence on the 
evolution of Christianity of which they were also a
product.
<P>
As the Gospel tradition was more or less Jewish-Christian
at its point of departure, it is a disaster that the Jewish-Christian 
Gospels have not come down to us. The most important of 
these, if not the oldest, seems to have been the Gospel of the 
Nazareans (a Jewish-Christian sect), the Gospel of which Jerome 
says he translated the Aramean text, [63] wrongly making it the 
original of canonical Matthew. It is at least true that the Gospel 
in question was somewhat nearly related to Matthew and, as it 
had a history of its own, may have been earlier than Matthew 
at some points and dependent on it at others. It was preserved 
in Jewish-Christian groups which accepted the virgin conception
and were still in existence at the end of the fourth century. 
According to Eusebius (iii, 39, 16) it contained the incident of the 
woman taken in adultery, a fragment belonging to the synoptic 
tradition which, passed by in the first three Gospels, fell in 
time, and as though by chance, into John. According to Jerome 
{<i>de viris</i>, 2) the first apparition of the risen Christ was accorded 
by this Gospel to James, [64] which is not surprising in a Jewish-Christian
book: after the apparition, Jesus administers the holy 
sacrament to James who is said to have eaten nothing since 
the last supper; a trait conforming to the customs of fasting at 
the Passover, which shows that this Jewish-Christian Gospel, 
like the four canonicals, was intimately connected with Easter 
observance. [65] The question is still discussed as to whether 
the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which seems to have 
been used by Jewish Christians in Egypt at a very early date, 
is to be distinguished from the Gospel of the Nazareans, or is
only another name for it.
<P>
The Gospel according to the Twelve, known as the Gospel
of the Ebionites, belonged to Christian groups existing in 
Transjordania at the time of Epiphanius; the genuine fragments 
of it are those given by him (<i>Heresies</i>, 30). Denying the virgin 
birth and professing that Jesus was made Son of God by his 
baptism, these Jewish-Christians were regarded as heretics;
but, Jewish as its colour was, their Gospel prescribed the abolition 
of the sacrifices, baptism taking its place. The Christ is made to
<P>
<center>55</center>
<P>
say "if you cease not your sacrifices, wrath will not cease to 
smite you." In general pattern the Ebionite Gospel resembles 
Mark; as to the contents, its affinity is with Matthew, and it 
professed to have been revised by that apostle. It was originally 
written in Greek and depended on earlier Gospels, but only 
on those in the synoptic tradition, chiefly Matthew and Luke. 
That it owes nothing to John does not prove it earlier and there 
seems no compelling reason to place it further back than the 
last quarter of the second century. [66]
<P>
The Gospel according to the Egyptians, of which it is to be 
regretted that we possess only a few fragments, [67] must have 
been more ancient and more gnostic in character. The Naasseenes 
quoted it; but Clement of Alexandria cites it after "the four 
transmitted to us"; so too, and with equal respect, does the 
homily known as the Second Epistle of Clement. Origen pays 
it no other honour than to place it at the head of the non-inspired 
Gospels and supposes that the prologue to Luke refers to this 
book and to the Gospel according to the Twelve as "attempts" 
preceding his own. The Gospel according to the Egyptians, so 
named in Egypt itself, must have been the one in use among 
Christians of Egyptian origin, the Gospel according to the 
Hebrews being that of Jewish-Alexandrian converts. The two, 
if as old as Origen makes them, would be of great value to the 
historian. It remains to add that the language of the Gospel of 
the Egyptians had a savour of gnosticism and that it taught 
a sex-mystery, an encratism, on which fuller information were 
much to be desired; [68] it is said to have been Sabellian which, 
however, does not diminish the interest of the problem raised 
by its existence. It was a Gospel parallel to the Synoptics, but 
edited independently of them.
<P>
The Gospel of Peter, known to us in a considerable fragment 
dealing with the passion and resurrection of the Christ, is an 
hellenic-christian Gospel of gnostic tendency on much the same 
line as the Gospel of the Ebionites in its relation to the canonical 
four, except that it depends on John as well as on the Synoptics. [69]
Not without reason did Serapion, Bishop of Antioch, having 
found it used by a Syrian community towards the end of the 
second century, reject it as infected with Docetism. [70] It must 
have been composed about the middle of that century, perhaps
<P>
<center>56</center>
<P>
in Syria, and is related to the apocryphal Apocalypse of Peter
already discussed.
<P>
Basilides, a gnostic teaching in Alexandria, about 140 composed
a Gospel on which he wrote a commentary. The Gospel 
was presented as based on the authority of Glaucias, a disciple 
of Peter—a case analogous to that of Mark—and in it we find 
the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. There is no reason to 
regard this Gospel as more freely composed than the others of 
which we have spoken, or that of Marcion. Like the Gospels of 
Valentinus and of Marcion, it was written for the use of the 
group of believers whom the author had gathered round him. 
As the church hierarchy was as yet but little organized, there 
was nothing abnormal in the literary experiments of these 
doctors and, apart from their particular tendencies in doctrine, 
they used no greater liberty in their method of composition 
than did the authors of the canonical Gospels.
<P>
Of the Gospel of Truth, used by the Valentinians, we know 
little more than the name. Valentinus appears to have put it 
out as derived from a certain Theodas, a disciple of Paul. [71] 
Marcion's Gospel, entitled simply <i>Evangelion</i>, with no recommending
name, was presented by him as the only true, he himself 
having amended it in conformity to what he believed was the 
doctrine of Paul. (To Marcion, with his <i>Evangelion</i> and <i>Apostolicon</i>
we shall return later.) Other gnostic Gospels made their 
appearance at the same time, such as the Gospel of Matthias, of 
Philip, of Judas, of Eve, of Mary, etc. It is easy to understand 
how, confronted with this inundation of Gospel literature, the 
leaders in the churches, beginning with the Roman, who had 
already repudiated Valentinus and Marcion, made up their 
minds to fix once and for all what Gospels, to the exclusion of
all others, were to be retained as apostolic.
<P>
Mention must here be made of Tatian's <i>Diatessaron</i> which was 
in essence a Gospel remodelled by the method generally adopted 
from the beginning in Gospel literature. The <i>Diatessaron</i> was 
the first Gospel of the Church of Edessa and for long remained 
official among the Syrian congregations; an interesting fact as 
showing how little regardful these congregations were, about 
170, of the canon which Irenaeus had just vaunted as fixed, and 
how they could arrange for themselves a Gospel not in liturgical
<P>
<center>57</center>
<P>
use in the congregations of the Roman world. It is however 
certain that Tatian's work was a harmony of the four canonical 
Gospels with a small number of secondary features seemingly 
borrowed from the non-canonical. More significant are the 
omissions and retouches which reveal Tatian's encratism and 
anti-semitic bias. [72]
<P>
The work of the Christian imagination in dealing with the 
birth of Jesus was not limited to the stories in Matthew and 
Luke. Some of the gnostics took part in it, and the idea of the 
virgin birth, with its mixed savour of encratism and docetism, 
probably came from that source. [73] Among the gospels of the 
infancy which have most influenced catholic tradition is the 
Protoevangel of James, a book written to establish the virginity 
of Mary <i>ante partum, in partu</i> and <i>post partum</i>, and in which the 
author has amplified both Luke and Matthew. [74] Although 
Justin's dependence on it is not proved, the core of the book 
may be dated as far back as the middle of the second century. 
It was written outside of Palestine and by a writer ignorant of 
Jewish affairs.
<P>
Very different in character is the Gospel of Thomas which 
tells of the miracles performed by Jesus in his infancy. The 
catholic version which has come down to us is apparently based 
on a gnostic gospel in which the story of Jesus bears a strong 
resemblance to that of the youth of Krishna, if not really modelled 
on it. The catholic versions are not very old, but the gnostic 
Gospel at the base was known to Irenaeus and Hippolytus, and 
is mentioned by Eusebius. Here, too, the date may go back to 
the middle of the second century.
<P>
The Acts of Pilate (the Gospel of Nicodemus) are of the 
fourth or fifth century and have no interest for our subject. 
When Justin refers his readers to the acts of Pilate for information 
about the passion of the Christ he is not referring to a book any 
more than when he refers them, for information about the birth, 
to the registers of the census made by Quirinius. But Tertullian, 
in his <i>Apology</i> (21), mentions a story told by Pilate at Tiberias 
about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus which seems to 
have been preserved as an appendix to the Gospel of Nicodemus. 
This document, fictitious as it is, would thus be earlier than 197. 
It is based on canonical Matthew.
<P>
<center>58</center>
<P>
In the literary class called "Acts" or "Travels," widely known 
and circulated in Hellenic antiquity (<font face="Symbol">praxeiV, periodoi</font>) [75] canonical 
Christian literature has produced only the Acts of the Apostles—a
book improperly named, since it comprises only the Acts of 
Peter, stopped short at his imprisonment by Agrippa I and his 
miraculous escape, and the Acts of Paul in his missions and 
captivity, but not continued to his martyrdom. Other Acts 
were written completing the canonical book in matters regarding 
Peter, Paul and John, or about other apostles less important in 
the tradition. Needless to say, the object aimed at in recounting 
the apostolic travels and miracles was to edify the reader in 
respect of the Christian propaganda and to shed lustre by 
one means or another on Christian teaching. But these apocryphal 
Acts, in contrast to the canonical book, do not rest upon a basis 
having the slightest claim to be historical and inform us only 
of the spirit and turn of mind of those who wrote them or found 
them to their taste. [76] They are pious romances more recent in 
date than the canonical Acts which they feebly imitate. Certain 
of their apostolic discourses are written in the style of rhythmical 
chanting, and occasionally we come upon veritable hymns—precious
samples of the Christian manner of worship.
<P>
Among these apocrypha, the Acts of John, incompletely 
preserved, seem to be the oldest. They are saturated with 
Docetism. They contain the Ephesian legend of John fully 
formed and were probably composed in Asia; in their first form 
before the end of the second century. In no sense is the book 
Marcionite, but Docetic in the highest degree: the identification 
of Christ with God is absolute, his humanity and death mere
appearance and the whole symbolic.
<P>
The Acts of Paul, known to Hippolytus and to Origen, were
widely diffused in the East. Tertullian says that the author, 
a priest of Asia, was dismissed when his fraud was discovered 
(<i>De Baptismale</i>, 17). None the less the book, constructed on 
canonical Acts and starting with Paul's mission to Antioch of 
Pisidia, continued to be widely read. Only fragments of it have 
survived, the most considerable and the most in favour being 
the piece which bears the title Acts of Paul and of Thecla. The 
mention of it by Tertullian places the composition towards 
160-180. The author appears to belong to the region chosen 
<P>
<center>59</center>
<P>
for the scene of his romance and may have exploited a local 
tradition along with Acts and the thirteen Epistles attributed
to Paul.
<P>
The Acts of Peter, which it has been possible to reconstruct
from the Clementine apocrypha, [77] and the Catholic Acts, in 
which the legend of Peter's martyrdom is developed, probably 
go no further back than the beginning of the third century, but 
they reflect some traditions and doubtless incorporate older
documents.
<P>
Of all these unorthodox lucubrations the strangest is the
Acts of Thomas, a Syrian work apparently composed in Syriac. 
It is made up of marvellous stories and liturgical hymns, all 
strongly impregnated with gnosis and encratism. The Greek 
version, if it is a version, is hardly less ancient than its Syriac 
original of which the date may be given about 200, without 
excluding the possibility of an earlier date for some of its elements.
<P>
The vogue enjoyed by all these writings of suspect origin is 
a point worthy of attention as proof that ancient Christianity 
was endowed with a singular capacity to receive what was 
offered to it, and even at a time when it was engaged in the
war with Gnosticism.
<P>
With the apocryphal Acts we pass beyond the limit of direct 
witness to the Christian movement before the year 180. It 
remains to mention those of the Christian apologies which 
have come down to us from the second century, chiefly the 
writings of Justin, his <i>Apologies</i> and <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>. 
Here we have a Christian teacher not without culture but with 
a mediocre range of mind, a Hermas but better versed in the 
Scriptures and with a tinge of philosophy. He was a moral philosopher
inclined to take Christianity as moral philosophy and 
to make it acceptable as such to pagans. His writings enable us 
to grasp the position of Christianity, about 150-160, surrounded 
by Judaism, paganism, gnostic heresy, and the first approach 
of that theory of the Logos which soon, at the hands of Irenaeus, 
Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, in preparation 
for Origen, was to fix the direction of the Christian gnosis. 
From these doctors themselves, or by inference from their 
writings, we cannot fail to learn how, during the middle part of 
the second century, there was forged the mighty power which
<P>
<center>60</center>
<P>
the Church invoked at the time, and was to evoke thenceforward, 
against all innovators, namely the power of tradition, embodied 
in the collection or canon of scripture, in the symbols of faith 
(creeds), in the episcopal magistracy—the whole, scripture, 
symbols and magistracy being held of apostolic origin, or rather 
as going back, through the apostles, to Jesus himself and his
Gospel.
<P>
We shall find the testimony of profane writers valuable at
certain points, but they cannot make good the insufficiency 
and clear up the obscurities of the Christian witness to Christian 
history. At least they convey to us the impression made by the 
new religion on the men of letters, the statesmen and the philosophers
of the time. Thus Celsus, though known to us solely 
through Origen, gives us the impression made by Christianity 
on enlightened people in the time of Marcus Aurelius, and shows 
us how the apparently irreconcilable conflict between Christianity 
and paganism might have ended by the incorporation of 
Christianity in the imperial religion, into which all religions 
were admitted, if hellenized Christianity had not been strong 
enough to compel its final acceptance as the one religion of the 
Empire. The genesis of the gnostic sects, of which the Great 
Church disencumbered itself by condemning them, is in like 
manner not accessible to us in the original writings of the doctors 
who founded them; the men and their writings we know only 
from those who refuted them when the sects had already lost 
some of their primitive force. Thus we are less well informed 
about dissenting Christianity than about dominant Christianity. 
More strictly speaking, the general history of the Christian 
movement, from its point of departure to the year 180, has to 
be deduced from documents distinctly non-historical in the 
proper sense of history, but intended to serve in some way the 
movement which produced them, and not as a faithful record 
for posterity of its stages and fortunes. To sum the matter up 
in a sentence, all the difficulties and gropings in the dark which 
the interpretation of these documents imposes on the impartial 
historian proceed from the fact that the documents he is interpreting
are something other than history.
