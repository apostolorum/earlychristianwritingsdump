<P>
<center><h2>BIRTH OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2></center>
<p>How did the Church succeed in expelling from her territory this flood of
multiform heresies which threatened to dissolve her unity in an endless
ebullition of short-lived sects? This is the question we have now to answer. A
summary answer lies in the fact that it was precisely this threat which
determined the Church to fix her constitution and lay down the limits beyond
which no Church membership could be. She concentrated her forces, built
fortifications, based herself on the past, interpreting and defining her past
against the turmoil of new theologies. Thus it came to pass that those who had
caused her most disquiet, and Marcion before all others, at the same time
incited her to define her doctrine, to regulate her organization and to put
forth the energy which broke their efforts.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size=+1>1. THE CHRISTIAN PROPHETS</font>
</p>
<p>We have
already called attention to the important fact that the intense life of the
first communities, their enthusiasm, and the popular appeal of the Christian
movement had long sustained the new religion without the support of any
literature having the authority of Scripture other than the Jewish Bible freely
interpreted by catechesis to the exaltation of Jesus. Into this catechesis, in
which the moral element was at first predominant, speculation soon began to
infiltrate, but mainly at tile beginning in the form of individual prophesyings,
of which we have seen examples in the gnoses contained in Paul's Epistles, in
the Epistle to the Hebrews, or, better, in the discourses of the Johannine
Christ. These early gnoses tended to complete rather than to reform or supplant
the common teaching. A check upon excessive audacity in prophetic outpourings
was found in the control which these prophet-teachers could exercise on each
other. First Corinthians, the Didache and Hermas all give instructions on this
head, which were soon found inadequate, but were not without temporary effect.

</p>
<p align="center">326

</p>
<p>An
elementary criterion for distinguishing permissible from impermissible
inspiration in a prophet is indicated in what Paul is made to say about
spiritual gifts (charismata) in i Corinthians xii, 3:

</p>
<p>Also I
declare to you&nbsp;<br>
that no
man, speaking by spirit of God,<br>
says:
&quot;Cursed be Jesus!&quot;<br>
And that
no man can say:<br>
&quot;Lord
Jesus!&quot;<br>
except
by holy spirit.
</p>
<p>Any
prophet, then, who in the course of his ecstasy utters a denial of Jesus, is
inspired by the demon: conversely, he who gives Jesus his rightful place by
proclaiming him &quot;Lord&quot; can only be inspired by God. In another passage
(xiv, 29-31) the regulation of the outpouring is entrusted to the prophets
themselves:

<p>As to
the prophets, let two or three be the speakers,<br>
And let
the rest pass judgment;<br>
But if
revelation comes to another who is seated,<br>
let the
first be silent;<br>
For you
can all prophesy one after another,<br>
so that
all may learn,<br>
and all
be exhorted.
</p>
<p>In the
Didache, after the prayers to be used in common at the Supper, we find the
following direction (x, 7): &quot;Let the prophets make a thanksgiving at such
length as they will.&quot; Thus the prophets, after Communion, have the right to
improvise their thanksgiving without limit of time. But immediately afterwards
the Didache forbids the reception of any preacher who teaches a doctrine
contrary to the catechesis just developed in the book (xi, 1-2) which, be it
remembered, is almost entirely moral and ritual, like the Christianity described
in Pliny's letter to Trajan. The Didache knows moreover of travelling apostles
and of prophets who remain at home in one place. Travelling apostles who stay
more than two days, in order to get more board and lodging, or ask for money,
are to be reckoned false (xi, 3-6), and this, not so much on account of their
heresies, but on the moral ground that they are exploiting their hosts, though
possibly heretical as well as rapacious. As to the sedentary prophets,

</p>
<p align="center">327

</p>
<p>their
inspired outpourings are not to be lightly criticized, but conduct is to be the
test for distinguishing the true prophet from the false. He alone is a true
prophet who lives according to the Lord; who would not count him a false prophet
who orders a sumptuous meal or demands money (xi, 7-12)? The prophets of old had
certain eccentricities, and a few such, analogous to theirs, and &quot;in
harmony with the cosmic mystery of the Church,&quot; may be tolerated in
Christian prophets, provided they do not require others to imitate them (xi, n).
A highly enigmatic concession, at least for us, and sufficiently disturbing in
itself; it cannot have been maintained for long. (The ancient prophets are
brought in only by way of a mitigating comparison.) The reference is to some
symbolic proceedings representing &quot;the mystery,&quot; which is, one can
hardly doubt, the mystic union of the Christ and &quot;the Church.&quot;
According to Irenaeus the innocent &quot;conjunctions&quot; (syzygies) of
Valentinus seem to have been mixed up by his disciple Marcus with certain rites
of symbolic magic in which mysticism had degenerated into eroticism. What the
Didache had in mind must have been something less abominable, perhaps a symbolic
marriage between an inspired couple, which may have been real, or an affair of
continency on both sides. But we can see that the author of the Didache, while
not daring to prohibit these eccentricities, is not quite at ease in the matter.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">2.
DECLINE OF THE PROPHETS AND RISE OF THE ADMINISTRATORS</font>

</p>
<p>&quot;True
prophets&quot; and &quot;true doctors&quot; who regularly contribute to the
edification of the community must be adequately supported, and to this end the
Didache lays down a sort of tithe-system (xiii) which obviously calls for a
measure of administration. Accordingly we find that, besides the prophets and
the doctors (teachers) with their charismatic endowments, the book knows also of
functionaries elected by and for the community — overseers (bishops),
ministers (deacons) — charged with the general work of organization and the
right ordering of the Sunday meetings. [1] The daily conduct of these
functionaries must also be worthy of the Lord; they must be honest men,
disinterested, sincere and well attested; and let the congregation remember that
they, too, serve it in the ministry of prophecy and teaching (xv) — an

</p>
<p align="center">328

</p>
<p>injunction
probably due to an early tendency to regard them as paid employees. But it-was
precisely to these elected administrators, who were also in charge of the
arrangements for the Eucharist, that the future belonged. We shall meet them
again. At the beginning of the second century, the recognized professors of
prophecy, of inspired teaching, are still in the forefront of the Christian
movement and pointing the way; but already it can be dimly foreseen that if ever
Christian union should be disturbed these inspired doctors are likely to be the
cause of disturbance and, equally, that if union is to be maintained the work of
maintaining it will be done by the elected administrators.

</p>
<p>In this
connexion the Shepherd of Hermas is most instructive. Hermas, too, is a prophet
of the congregation like those to whom the citations from First Corinthians and
the Didache have already introduced us. Moreover he is — if one may use the
expression — a highly conservative prophet. A contemporary 6f Valentinus and
Marcion, with whom he doubtless came into contact at meetings of the Roman
Christians, our Hermas is no purveyor of novelties and hazardous speculations;
he is a doctor of the old school, altogether in the style of the Didache, a good
man living &quot;according to the Lord,&quot; the teacher of a morality framed
on the pattern of the primitive Christian catechesis — in a word, the least
gnostic of prophets. But his relation to what we have called the administration
of the Church is no longer that in which we find the prophets of the Didache. In
his Third Vision the Church makes him sit down on her left, with the presbyters
behind him, the right being reserved for the martyrs (Vision, iii, i, 8-9). He
himself seems to have thought, and with good reason, that the presbyter
administrators might well have been seated in front of him. But the hierarchy as
he conceived it, in the order of martyrs, prophets, presbyters, was not the
order destined to prevail. In fact the presbyter-bishops are already in the
front rank and are not going to let even the martyrs precede them. From now on,
when Hermas, in his capacity of prophet, addresses his exhortations to the
community, he can have them read in public only by consent of the presbyters who
preside over the Church; so he has two copies made, one for Clement (doubtless a
leading presbyter) and the other for the deaconess Grapte; Clement will
undertake to send the book to

</p>
<p align="center">329

</p>
<p>outlying
congregations — and so the prophet gets publicity, but under supervision —
while Grapte will use it for the instruction of widows and orphans who are
unable to attend the great meetings and belong to the department of charitable
help. [2] It is clear, then, that while the Church in heaven still gives the
prophet Hermas precedence over the presbyters, things are differently ordered in
the Church on earth. Here the presbyters have direct control over the prophet,
insomuch that without their authority and mediate action the revelations of
Hermas could not have seen the light either among the Christians of Rome or
elsewhere. Be it noted, these presbyters are the same men as those who examined
Marcion's doctrine and stamped it with their disapproval. The next step to be
taken, which we shall soon see, will be that those who preside over
administration and worship will reserve to themselves the right to have their
voices heard in the assemblies, especially when prophecy is raising a scandal.

</p>
<p>Here,
then, in Rome we find a body of presbyters who, almost at the same time,
authorize the prophecy of the Pastor and expel Valentinus and Marcion from the
community, men whom our prophet would perhaps have treated with less severity.
What did Hermas think about this body, and what was it in reality? According to
what seems a trustworthy tradition Hermas was own brother to the bishop Pius.
But Hermas speaks only of presbyters in general and never mentions the bishop,
his brother. In speaking of presbyters in general he betrays no enthusiasm and
seems to make no distinction between them and the bishops whom he places side by
side with the deacons. [3] The same individuals are described indifferently as
&quot;presbyters&quot; and &quot;heads of the church,&quot; or as
&quot;presbyters presiding over the Church.&quot; [4] But however considerable
these dignitaries may be, Hermas does not hesitate to address them in pretty
plain terms. It is true that the Church is here speaking as the Pastor or Angel
of Penitence:

</p>
<p>&quot; 'Tis
to you I speak, ye heads of the Church and occupants of the high places. Be not
like the poisoners: poisoners carry their poison in bottles: you carry your
poison and your venom in your hearts ... Be careful, my children, or these
divisions will be the end of you. How can you form the Lord's elect while you

</p>
<p align="center">330

</p>
<p>yourselves
are unformed? Then set about forming one another so that I, joyously presenting
you to the Father, may be able to account for you to the Lord.&quot; [5]

</p>
<p>From all
this the fact emerges that the presbyters, so sharply taken to task by the
Church, have already assumed the disciplinary control of the community. The
Church and Hermas agree, not without reason, that they would be more worthy of
their headship, if they were less covetous of power.

</p>
<p>It is
clear that this presbyterial body already possessed considerable authority, and
highly probable that it had a presiding bishop, [6] whose authority was not
exercised independently of his colleagues. Bishops and priests, who allowed
Hermas to speak the truth about them, are not likely to have been more exacting
than he in the matter of pure theology. For the good Hermas is far from being a
dogmatist in that department, and looks upon heresy more in pity than in anger.
He is ready to die for the Lord Christ; but his Christology is strangely
indecisive; unshakably firm on the unity of God, he is totally ignorant of any
Christological definition. The figurative language used in his book causes him
to avoid mentioning Jesus and Christ by name. But clearly he has not the
faintest idea of the Logos and its incarnation. His Son of God is far superior
to the archangels, but is inconsistently presented as their leader and the first
of them (Parable, ix, 4); elsewhere the Son seems to be identified with the
Spirit (v, 2, 5, 6). In the fifth Parable, where the wanderings of his
Christology are represented in a Parable of the Vine, imitated from the Gospel,
[7] there appears a servant named &quot;Flesh,&quot; in whom the Son-Spirit has
his abode, and whose work on the Vine has been so marvellous that the Father,
agreeing with the wishes of the Son and the angels, appoints him the Son's
co-heir (v, 6). But let us not jump to the conclusion that Hermas here presents
his Trinity composed of Eternal Father, Son-Spirit and a God-man; for the
parable is so complicated and obscure that the &quot;servant&quot; pre-exists in
the humanity of the Son, who is also active in the Vine (v, 2, 6); from which it
will be seen that the Christology of Hermas is simply amorphous and incoherent.
The Roman presbyters, who were not scandalized by it, cannot have been any
stricter in the definition of their own. There was however one point of doctrine
on which they would allow no

</p>
<p align="center">331

</p>
<p>compromise.
They expelled Marcion for attacking it. This was the unity of God.

</p>
<p>Hermas
speaks of heretics, as he speaks of the presbyters, with freedom, but without a
trace of passion (ix, 22). We can see clearly that the gnostics have not led him
astray. He knows them well enough and could not fail to know many of them. He
finds their doctors somewhat unintelligible, presumptuous, too pleased with
themselves and priding themselves on being omniscient; the higher knowledge they
claim seems to him mere nonsense; on the whole he judges them more fools than
knaves. Many ought to be dismissed outright — which shows that the case of
Marcion was not solitary, although outstanding and the best known to us. Some
have repented of their follies and been taken back into the fold; those who
stick to their nonsense will be destroyed by it. This seems to have been the
attitude of the presbyters themselves in the excommunications of which Hermas
speaks, and it would be thus that they judged Marcion and his like; gnosis was
of no account and meant nothing to them, but in doctrine they held firm by the
baptismal catachism, understood in the sense of the Didache, as Hermas also
understood it. There can be no doubt that what shocked them in Marcion was his
attack on the unity of God, which they would counterattack by simply asserting
against the innovator the traditional apostolic teaching of the one only God,
creator of the world, and the one only Christ, Jesus the Son of God, sent by the
Father to save men from their sins and to instruct them in the way of
righteousness. That this tradition was an existing force is beyond question. The
gnostic teachers compelled the administrators of Church discipline to exert that
force with resolution against their new theologies.

</p>
<p>It is a
noteworthy fact that, except in regard to the Logos, Justin's Christology is
hardly less fluid than that of Hermas.

</p>
<p>The two
draw near together in the curious profession of faith in which the apologist
declares that Christians believe in one only God who created the world [8] and
with him worship the Son who left his Father's presence to teach true doctrine
to men, having with him &quot;the host of other good angels who resemble him,
and the Spirit of Prophecy&quot; (with which may be compared i Timothy v, 21,
&quot;I adjure thee before God, Jesus Christ and

</p>
<p align="center">332

</p>
<p>the
elect angels&quot;). The Roman presbyters found Justin orthodox and after their
condemnation of Marcion, Justin pronounced his, denouncing the idea of a god
superior to the creator of the world as an invention of demons. In accusing
Marcion of polytheism Justin speaks as a defender of Old Testament and Gospel
tradition.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">3. RISE
OF A SETTLED TRADITION</font>

</p>
<p>The
watchword of the Church leaders in the campaign against gnostic heresy is found
in the pastoral Epistles 

</p>
<p>(i
Timothy vi, 20, 21; 2 Timothy i, 14):<br>
O
Timothy, guard the deposit,<br>
shunning
impious word-play<br>
and the
antitheses of so-called gnosis,<br>
Professed
by some,<br>
who err
concerning the faith.

</p>
<p>This
couplet, the closing note of the First to Timothy, is aimed directly at Marcion
and must have been written under the immediate impression of his breach with the
Church or, more probably, of his attempt to change the basis of Christian
teaching. &quot;Paul,&quot; and the very Paul whom Marcion exalted to so great a
height, is now heard beseeching the congregations of the faithful to &quot;guard
the deposit&quot; — against Marcion. Against Marcion also the following
profession of faith (ii, 5-6) is perhaps directed:

</p>
<p>God is
one,<br>
one also
the mediator between God and men,<br>
the man
Christ Jesus,<br>
Who gave
himself a ransom for all,<br>
as
witnessed in his time.

</p>
<p>The
following hymn or prophetic oracle belongs to the same class (i Timothy iii,
16):

</p>
<p>He was
manifested in flesh,<br>
he was
justified in spirit,<br>
he was
seen of angels,<br>
He was
preached among the Gentiles,<br>
he was
believed in the world,<br>
he was
taken up into glory. 

</p>
<p align="center">333

</p>
<p>Finally
Marcion is probably included among the &quot;lying spirits&quot; (i Timothy iv,
2-3):

</p>
<p>Who
forbid to marry,<br>
prescribe
abstinence from foods<br>
which
God has made to be taken with thanksgiving<br>
by
believers and those who know the truth. [9]

</p>
<p>Marcion's
asceticism is perhaps in the writer's mind when he advises Timothy to drink a
little wine for the good of his stomach. But there is another passage (i, 4-6)
where the target is not Marcion alone, but gnostics in general, with Valentinus
as chief offender. Here are the instructions (i Timothy i, 4):

</p>
<p>To keep
clear of fables, and endless genealogies,<br>
which
produce wranglings,<br>
rather
than divine order in faith.<br>
But the
goal of preaching is charity,<br>
coming
out of pure heart, good conscience and true faith:<br>
Wherefrom
some cut themselves off<br>
in their
love of empty talk,<br>
Setting
up as doctors of law,<br>
without
knowing what they talk about,<br>
nor what
they vouch for. [10]

</p>
<p>These
were also the views of Hermas, Polycarp and Justin. True doctrine, according to
them, is a simpler affair than what these windy word-mongers have to offer; what
matters above all else is life according to God.

</p>
<p>In
resisting the gnostic invasion, the defenders of the faith made continual appeal
to apostolic tradition, not hesitating to represent their own denunciations of
the new doctors as spoken by Paul, the &quot;Paul,&quot; that is, of the First
to Timothy (vi, 13-14):

</p>
<p>I charge
you, before God,<br>
who
gives life to all,<br>
And
before Christ Jesus,<br>
who
witnessed under Pontius Pilate<br>
the good
confession,<br>
To keep
intact and spotless the commandment<br>
until
the epiphany of Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>
<p>The
&quot;commandment&quot; is the apostolic catechesis and the equivalent of the
&quot;deposit&quot; of vi, 20. The mention of Pontius

</p>
<p align="center">334

</p>
<p>Pilate
is not made for the sake of historical precision; it is a formula taken from a
hymn or rhythmical confession connected with the ritual recitation of the
passion story.

</p>
<p>In like
strain speaks the &quot;Paul&quot; of the Epistle to Titus (i, 9).

</p>
<p>Let the
presbyter, he says,<br>
Stand by
the pure word according to the doctrine,<br>
that he
may be able to exhort in the genuine teaching,<br>
and hurl
back the rebels.

</p>
<p>The
context shows that the &quot;rebels&quot; against whom this was directed were
not pagans, nor were they, strictly speaking, Jews.

</p>
<p>They
were heretical debaters, with the turn for contentiousness characteristic of
amateurs in theology. The author says that such people were extremely numerous
in his time (Titus i, 10-11).

</p>
<p>The
author of the First to Timothy will have it that the apostles foretold an
outbreak of gnosis. The Epistle makes Paul speak as follows (iv, i):

</p>
<p>But the
Spirit says expressly<br>
that in
the last days many will desert the faith,<br>
Taking
up with lying spirits<br>
and with
doctrines of demons, etc. [11]

</p>
<p>It was
not solely on account of their heterodoxy that the gnostic systems are said to
be the work of &quot;demons,&quot; but also for their mythological character,
which almost turned them into pantheons. Without making distinctions among them,
these heretics were credited with almost every conceivable vice and crime —
see the list in 2 Timothy iii, 1-9. The accusation of immorality is the daily
bread of this polemic, and hardly worth consideration, especially when
formulated in general terms.

</p>
<p>Reproducing
the same diatribe against the gnostics, or commenting on it, the spurious Jude
and the spurious Peter of the second Epistle recall, rather naively, that
&quot;the Lord's Apostles&quot; foretold &quot;for these last times&quot; a crop
of sectaries &quot;who will make classifications&quot; distinguishing two kinds
of believers, the psychic and the spiritual, &quot;psychics themselves without a
trace of spirit&quot;&quot; — apparently another shot at Valentinus (Jude
17-19). Spurious Peter drops a hint that a little caution will not be out of
place in reading the letters of &quot;our

</p>
<p align="center">335

</p>
<p>dear
brother Paul, in which there are certain knotty points which, to their own ruin,
ignorant and unsteady souls take wrongly along with other Scriptures,&quot;
namely the Old Testament and the Gospel. Who can these be but Marcion and his
followers? (2 Peter
iii, 15-16). 

</p>
<p>Almost
contemporary with spurious Peter, we shall find Polycarp, [12] with an Epistle
of John before him, attacking Marcion, as chief offender, in the following terms
(Philippians 7):

</p>
<p>&quot;Whosoever
confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is antichrist; whosoever
confesses not the witness of the cross is of the devil; whosoever twists the
oracles of the Lord to suit his own desire, and denies the resurrection and the
judgment is Satan's eldest son. Leave we then the futilities of that crowd and
let us return to the teaching that was given us.&quot;

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">4. THE
TRADITION ESTABLISHED</font>

</p>
<p>It
remains only to hear Irenaeus delivering his &quot;exposition of apostolic
preaching&quot; [13] fully assured that he is in possession of the True Faith
&quot;as traditionally taught by the elders, disciples of the apostles.&quot;
[14] Immediately after him comes the De. Praescriptione Haereticorum of
Tertullian which opposes the heretics by the argument of
&quot;prescription.&quot; With that, the notion of tradition, as the Church
would have it understood and as it has come down through the centuries, will be
fully formed. The following passage in Chapter 19, marvellously true as a
definition of Latin Christianity through the ages, gives the fundamental idea:

</p>
<p>&quot;Ergo
non ad Scripturas provocandum est, nee in his constituendum certamen, in quibus
aut nulla aut incerta victoria est, aut parum certa. Nam etsi non evaderet
conlatio Scripturarum, ut utramque partem parem sisteret, ordo rerum desiderabat
illud prius proponi, quod nunc solum disputandum est: quibus competat fides ipsa,
cujus sint Scripturae, a quo et per quos et quando et quibus sit tradita
disciplina qua fiunt Christian! Ubi enim apparuerit esse veritatem disciplinae
et fidei christianae, illic et veritas Scripturarum et expositionum et omnium
traditionum Christianorum.&quot;

</p>
<p>What
Tertullian says in this passage could not have been

</p>
<p align="center">336

</p>
<p>said as
it here stands in the year 150, nor even in 180. It implies an exclusive
&quot;possession&quot; of Scriptures, tradition and ecclesiastical authority
which the church had not made good before the end of the interval between the
two dates. But Tertullian's genius saw clearly the barrenness of all these
disputings: saw the disadvantage the Church would suffer if she met the
innovators as equals and on their own ground; saw, also, the summary procedure
that was needed to put a quick end to the whole futile discussion. The one thing
Tertullian did not foresee was that the system he had so clearly laid down would
be turned to his own hurt, and that he would die a heretic. But the notion of
&quot;tradition,&quot; as the Church would have it understood, and as it was
destined to endure through the centuries, may be counted fully born with
Tertullian's assertion of the Church's prescriptive right as exclusive possessor
and only competent interpreter of the sources of the faith.

</p>
<p>This
notion of tradition corresponded to a fact: the unbroken continuity of
monotheistic faith, of Jewish morality taken up into the Gospel and of the
worship of the Christ Jesus in the very heart of every Christian community. But,
at the same time, it was and could not fail to be a somewhat fictitious
assumption, an artificial but timely device of special pleading forced upon the
Church by a kind of moral necessity, and onesidedly formulated in her own
interest as she reacted to the pressure of a movement towards a fusion of
religions on an intellectualist or pagan basis. For the idea of an absolute and
unchangeable orthodoxy is in flat contradiction to the nature and history of the
human mind, of human knowledge and even of Christianity itself. That which was
now canonized as &quot;the apostolic faith&quot; was far from being the simple
faith of the first believers in Jesus, nor was it that of the first apostles to
the Gentile world. When Irenaeus reasons as though, between himself and the
first apostles of the Christ, there was but a single generation, represented by
the elders, or disciples of the apostles, he is resting upon a fiction, by then
accepted, but entirely fanciful: between the second third of the first century
and the time of his writing in the last third of the second, several generations
of Christian believers had passed away who had not confined the expression of
their belief to a repetition of the apostolic catechism. The pretended

</p>
<p align="center">337

</p>
<p>tradition
which the Church would fix for all time, was largely created in the very process
of defining it. At that point in time it was nothing else than a kind of
rudimentary and unformed gnosis imperfectly coherent, in which the germ of
endless disputes, nay, of heresy in many a form, lay hidden and awaiting its
future development. It could not be, and never has been, anything else.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">5. BIRTH
OF THE CANON</font>

</p>
<p>We know
how Marcion, cast out by the Church, had set up his own biblical canon in her
face, to be used in resisting her, as need should arise. This, according to him,
contained the true and authentic Gospel, the Gospel as Jesus had really preached
it, which Paul alone had preserved from Jewish contamination. That is to say it
contained the revelation of the good God, the true God, whereas the Jewish bible
was the revelation of the Jewish god, an imperfect deity of a lower order, who
was, however, the creator of the visible world, a world on the same lower level
as its creator and no less imperfect than he. The idea of such a collection
would never have occurred to Marcion had he not found the Church already in
possession of an authorized Bible, which was judged to contain the revelation of
the true God and of Christ Jesus which he, for his part, could not find there.
This was the Bible of the Alexandrian Jews, in which the Church was for ever
taxing her wits to find the Gospel prefigured and foretold. Marcion's
acquaintance with the Jewish manner of exegesis may possibly have led him to the
conclusion that this interpretation of prophecy was on the whole absolutely
groundless. With these ideas in mind the arch-heretic turned to the current
literature of Christianity and picked out from it the documents which he Judged
to give the truest account of the religion of Jesus, and then proceeded to
collect them in an expurgated version in harmony with the end he had in view.

</p>
<p>It was
Marcion, then, with his belief in the unique value of the Gospel, who raised the
evangelical and apostolic writings from the relative obscurity caused by the
overshadowing of the ancient Scriptures, in which they had hitherto lain, more
or less familiar, no doubt, to the congregation from public reading, but not yet
Scripture on a footing with the books of Moses and

</p>
<p align="center">338

</p>
<p>the
prophets of Israel; he it was who brought out these writings into the full light
of day and endowed them with the status of Scriptures. No one doubted that they
were the work of the Spirit, but, quite naturally, the prestige of the ancient
Bible had hitherto outshone them. Now, if there is one thing more evident than
another at this momentous juncture, it is that the Church could not effectively
counter the audacity of these new theologians were it to rely solely on the
existing Scriptures of Old Testament books, since these, strictly interpreted,
could only be made to plead the cause of Judaism. The attack had to be met on
its own ground, and this could only be done by opposing a tradition earlier to
that of the innovators and by means of documents traditionally evangelical and
apostolic. Certainly Marcion was under no illusion in professing that this
tradition was not trustworthy. Since Irenaeus and Tertullian he is bitterly
abused for rejecting or changing the apostolic writings, but neither his denial
of the apostolicity of the Gospels, nor the reasons he gave for it, have been
seriously discussed. When Celsus reproaches the Christians with never ceasing to
make alterations in their Gospels he is perhaps only repeating something that
Marcion had said after direct experience of its truth. But the cause of the
Church would have been lost by admitting suspicion as to the apostolic
authenticity of her texts and by making it a matter for discussion; the idea of
critically examining it could not enter her mind, and did not. She boldly
entrenched herself in her catechetical tradition, of which the various Gospels
and the apostolic writings, or those deemed such, were also the documents; then,
taking a leaf out of Marcion's book, she decided, and it would seem promptly, to
canonize those of the Gospel and apostolic writings which had the usage of the
congregations to recommend them or seemed likely to serve her in a situation so
distressing and unforeseen.

</p>
<p>At the
time when the Church was canonizing her collection of writings she energetically
went to work in assigning them to writers whose names would confer authenticity
on the selected books; an assignment rather retrospective, since the question of
their authenticity had been, up to that moment, of little interest. The
explanations given about the New Testament books by the Canon of Muratori and
the statements of Irenaeus on the

</p>
<p align="center">339

</p>
<p>origin
of the Gospels are an apologia for the official collection as a whole; but
already Justin had made a milder apologia for the Gospels by presenting them
more discreetly under the general term &quot;Memoirs of the Apostles,&quot;
while Papias had pleaded for the ecclesiastical text of Mark and of Matthew.
Both Marcion and his adversaries were eager to find assurance for texts about
whose authenticity neither of them were very confident. And both sides made a
virtue of necessity.

</p>
<p>But the
Church could not limit her canon as narrowly as Marcion had limited his, nor had
she at the time any motive to do so. The Gospel writings to begin with were
drawn up and circulated to meet the needs of the various communities, and those
were selected for canonization which had been adopted for liturgical use by the
most important of them. The first Gospel, as B. W. Bacon maintains, seems to
have gained authority in the Syrian congregations; [15] the third held the field
in Greece proper and in Rome, [16] where Mark also was in use; [17] the fourth
had taken root in the congregations of Asia which were full of life at the time
when the canon was made. Alexandria, at this period still a mystery to the
historian, seems to have contributed nothing to the Gospel canon, although she
had been fertile ground for literature of that type, but we know that she did
not force the acceptance of her Gospel of the Egyptians on the canonizers and
soon abandoned it herself. Perhaps she was not at first admitted to the concert
of Churches, by which the Gospel canon was fixed, for Alexandria was reputed a
hotbed of gnosticism, and her Gospel of the Egyptians contained more than a
little of the offending article. It is possible, moreover, that the Christian
groups in Alexandria were not unified early enough to speak with a single voice
in the negotiations which fixed the combined canon of the Gospels and of the
whole New Testament, and that this was made without consulting the Alexandrian
Christians, who, however, finally accepted the decision taken by the others. It
is worthy of note that when the Paschal controversy, about 180, was agitating
every Christian community from Edessa to Lyons, Alexandria does not enter into
direct relations with Pope Victor and sends her views on the affair, only after
it was settled, to the communities in Palestine {Eusebius, v, 25, 23).

</p>
<p>It is
easy to explain how the three Pastoral Epistles came to be

</p>
<p align="center">340

</p>
<p>annexed
to the Ten Epistles previously known as Paul's. These three letters corresponded
so exactly to the needs of the hour that the correspondence cannot have been the
result of chance. If not written expressly to satisfy the needs of the Church in
her campaign against Marcion, they were completed and turned to such good
account against him that the whole collection of thirteen Epistles may be called
anti-Marcionite. We can also understand how the fourth Gospel, once accepted,
would bring in the first Johannine Epistle and the two others in its train. The
main difficulty of the canonists must have been that of securing acceptance,
outside of Asia, for the Gospel they called John's, and first of all at Rome.
Asia was its fortress. This Gospel is in keeping with the Easter usage of the
Quartodecimans, which forms the background to its arrangement of the passion
stories; Polycrates, with good reason, refers to this in his letter to Pope
Victor {Eusebius, v, 24, 3); Montanism had adopted it and the Asiatic
congregations made its fortune when their influence compelled the other Churches
to give it recognition. Agreement on the matter was reached under the pressure
of a necessity equally felt on either side and, we may be sure, not without
mutual concessions and interested, perhaps concerted, adaptations of the text.
[18] In establishing the canon of the four Gospels in particular there can be no
doubt that a time came when the resolution was taken by all parties to establish
a united front against the gnostic irruption and especially against the projects
of Marcion.

</p>
<p>Apostolicity
being the quality aimed at and the order of the day, nothing came more
conveniently to hand than the Acts of the Apostles, a book which had hitherto
been outshone in credit by its twin brother, the third Gospel. This book of Acts
was doubly to the purpose, first in its picture of Christianity as a harmless
religion, loyal to the Roman empire, and then by its hostility to gnostic
innovators, whom it represents Paul as denouncing in advance at Ephesus (xx, 29,
30) just as it makes him inaugurate the philosophical defence of Christianity in
his speech to the Areopagus, [19] which contains the germ of Justin's
apologetics — minus the Logos. But, notwithstanding the attractions it must
have had for the canonists, the influence of this book on the evolution of
Christian thought has never equalled that of the Fourth Gospel and of the
Epistles attributed to Paul. Both Rome and Asia knew

</p>
<p align="center">341

</p>
<p>the
first of the two Epistles called Peter's and included it in the canon as
apostolic. The Apocalypse of John, declared apostolic in Asia was received as
such in Rome where, as yet, its millenarianism had raised no alarm. Justin knew
and esteemed it, and the Canon of Muratori defends its reputation which had been
compromised by the sudden outbreak of Montanism. But in the third century we
find the catholic gnostics of Alexandria judging it unfavourably; only by the
influence of the West was it saved from the discredit which overtook the
Apocalypse of Peter even in Rome, where it was accepted towards the end of the
second century. A strange case was that of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Although
Alexandria had early attributed this Epistle to Paul; although it was read in
Rome before Marcion was known there, for the Epistle of Clement puts it largely
under contribution; [20] although it is cited by Tertullian as the work of
Barnabas, and used by him to pour ridicule on Hermas, [21] we find nevertheless
that it was not included in the canon as apostolic till the end of the fourth
century. Perhaps the reason lay in the fact that Rome had begun its acquaintance
with this document in full knowledge that it was not apostolic.

</p>
<p>Whatever
the truth may be about the inclusion of particular books, the fact is
unquestionable that the main body of the New Testament was solidly constituted
by the end of the second century. It then included the four Gospels, the Acts of
the Apostles, thirteen Epistles of Paul, the first Epistle of Peter and the
first Epistle of John. Needless to say this canonization of New Testament
writings was not made in a day and there and then proclaimed by a council
assembled ad hoc. But by the time of Irenaeus it appears to have been so far
completed. The principle of &quot;apostolicity&quot; on which it was based must
have been laid down at the very beginning by a kind of concert among the
Churches chiefly concerned and by them made dominant. Looking closely into the
matter we cannot but feel that, but for the ruling of this principle, the
juxtaposition of the Fourth Gospel with the three Synoptics would not be natural
in a collection intended to support the common teaching of the Church. In Rome
the Fourth Gospel was long ignored and, even in the early part of the second
century, Caius, a Roman presbyter, dared to launch a polemic against the
Johannine writings, though this, it is true, was at a

</p>
<p align="center">342

</p>
<p>time
when Asia was in bad odour at Rome over the Easter controversy. But the
testimony of Irenaeus makes it clear [22] that in certain quarters opposition to
the Fourth Gospel was lively enough in his time and connected with the
opposition to Montanism, a movement Asiatic in origin. But, so long as these
adversaries of the Fourth Gospel accepted the first three, they were not charged
with heresy.

</p>
<p>It must
have been, then, by a formal agreement, arrived at after full interchange of
views between Rome and the Asiatic Churches, that the principle of the fourfold
or &quot;tetramorphic&quot; Gospel was finally adopted. When and how cannot be
stated with precision and certitude. It was done before Irenaeus who defends the
principle with assiduity and ardour, and certainly did not invent it, for he was
in no position to lay it down for the whole Christian Church. If a conjecture
may be ventured on so nice a point, as good a conjecture as any would be that
agreement was reached at Rome in conversations between the bishop Anicetus and
Polycarp of Smyrna. Of the reasons for Polycarp's journey to Rome we know
nothing and can only say that his great age and his functions rule out the
likelihood that he made the journey for pleasure. Irenaeus mentions it
incidentally in his letter to Victor about the Easter controversy {Eusebius, v,
24 and 16). Irenaeus, then Bishop of Lyons, who may well have known more about
the matter than he tells, relates how &quot;the blessed Polycarp being come to
Rome under Anicetus,&quot; the two bishops &quot;discussed between them certain
questions on which they soon came to an understanding, but avoided quarrelling
on the subject&quot; of Easter, Polycarp being immovable in the observance he
held to be apostolic and Anicetus equally so in that which &quot;the presbyters
before his time&quot; had followed. Polycarp, then, did not come to Rome to
negotiate about Easter, but to examine with Anicetus &quot;the small differences
that existed between them.&quot; The gnostic crisis being then at its height and
the Marcionite movement in full swing, it seems probable that Polycarp came to
Rome as representing the Asiatic Churches for the purpose of concerting common
measures with Anicetus for stemming the mounting flood of heresy. Obviously the
first measure demanded by the situation was to fix the sources from which the
true evangelical and apostolic tradition was derived. Is it not likely that
among the

</p>
<p align="center">343

</p>
<p>decisions
then taken one was the determination of the number of the Gospels and perhaps
also the number of Paul's Epistles? The foundation of the New Testament canon
would then have been built. The rest would be completed between 160 and 180,
Acts obtaining official recognition by the side of the Epistles; then finally,
the anti-montanist reaction, which threw suspicion on the Apocalypse of John,
would be satisfied by excluding the Apocalypse of Peter, formerly accepted by
some of the Churches, along with the Pastor of Hermas, which the Roman Church
piously retained till then as an authorized prophecy. [23]

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">6.
SHAPING OF THE APOSTOLIC CREED</font>

</p>
<p>A
barrier of writings declared apostolic was insufficient protection against the
advancing tide of innovation. Just as Marcion was using the principles of his
own doctrine to interpret the Gospel and the Apostolicon, on which he professed
the principles were founded, so the Church interpreted her New Testament by the
principles of her catechesis, defining them with greater amplitude and precision
as she reacted against the new heresies, and especially against Marcion.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>As we
have seen above (pp. 332 ff.) the pastoral
Epistles contain the rudiments, or the echoes, of this professedly apostolic
creed. So, too. Clement when he writes (i Clement, 46, 6):

</p>
<p>&quot;Have
we not one (and the same) God, one Christ, one Spirit of pardon poured out on
us, one (and the same) vocation in Christ?&quot; Justin, again, seems to be
paraphrasing a formula of faith when he assures the emperors that the Christians
are not atheists, but believers in the true God, venerating him with &quot;the
Son who comes from him&quot; and with the spirit of prophecy. [24]
But we
have no means of knowing what the precise formula was to which the paraphrase
corresponds. A little further on (1, 61) Justin explains how Christians are born
anew in the baptismal immersion &quot;in the name of God, father and lord of all
things, of our saviour Jesus Christ and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; These three
terms of the baptismal confession can hardly be later than the year 150. They
are the main features of a formulary subsequently elaborated in opposition to
gnosis and concentrate

</p>
<p align="center">344

</p>
<p>what the
Church was bent on regarding as the essence of &quot;apostolic preaching.&quot;

</p>
<p>What
Irenaeus has to say (Heresies, i, 10) about the faith received by the Church
from the apostles and their disciples affords a glimpse of the formulary in the
process of shaping. It is, he says, faith in one only God, the Father almighty,
who created heaven, earth, sea and all they contain; in one only Christ, Jesus,
Son of God, made flesh for our salvation; and in the holy Spirit, who by the
prophets announced the scheme of salvation, the coming, virgin birth, passion,
resurrection from the dead of Christ, Jesus our Lord, his coming again in the
glory of the Father, to gather all together and raise to life the whole of
mankind before passing judgment on every individual.

</p>
<p>It is to
be remarked that Irenaeus in his profession of the catholic faith introduces the
Gospel history of birth, passion, etc., not into his second article (faith in
the Christ) but into his third (faith in the Holy Spirit) where he presents it
as a prophesied history, precisely as Justin conceived it and as it is conceived
in the Gospels themselves. It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of
this feature. It shows that the modern scholar who discovers, and truly
discovers, that the Gospels are histories, not of the historical Jesus, but of
the accomplishment of prophecy in the Christ, is simply discovering a fact which
Irenaeus seems to have known well enough. In other respects the unity of God and
the unity of the Christ are affirmed against Marcion chiefly; the same is true
of the incarnation, the bodily resurrection and the last judgment. Instead of
giving sole prominence to the role of the Father in creating the world, as was
done in the catechesis before Marcion challenged it, the doctrine of salvation
is now brought to the front, no doubt in accord with the Epistles of Paul and
with John, but also in accord with Marcion, who is here both followed and
corrected.

</p>
<p>The
title of his other writing, The Exposition of the Apostolic Preaching, shows by
its bare announcement the dominant thought of Irenaeus and the idea he had
formed of the tradition as &quot;apostolic preaching&quot; — a preaching whose
content he himself, in his time, largely contributed to defining.
In this Exposition

</p>
<p align="center">345

</p>
<p>he
recalls how &quot;we have all received baptism for the remission of sins in the
name of God the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, son of God, incarnate, dead
and raised again, and in the holy Spirit of God&quot; (Exposition, 3). A little
further on (6) he explains that the whole structure of the faith and the scheme
of salvation rests upon the following three articles:

</p>
<p>God,
Father, increate, invisible, creator of all things — this is the first article
of our faith.

</p>
<p>And this
is the second: the Word of God, Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who appeared
to the prophets in the form of their prophecy and according to the power of the
Father's disposition; by whom were all things created; he it was who, in the
fullness of time, to accomplish all things and omit nothing, was made man among
men, visible and tangible, to destroy death and reveal life, and to make
effective the communion and union of God and man.

</p>
<p>Third
article: the holy Spirit by whose power the prophets prophesied, the fathers
were instructed in the knowledge of God, the just guided in the way of
righteousness; and who, in the last days, is shed forth in a new manner on the
human race throughout the world, renewing mankind for God.

</p>
<p>The
article of the holy Spirit is also the article of the Church, but given a turn
which avoids the condemnation of the Montanists. In his comments on the three
articles, Irenaeus develops a veritable gnosis in which soteriology is adapted
to cosmology and the Old Testament harmonized with the New. This gnosis,
apparently derived from the Gospels and Epistles, but better balanced than the
rough outlines of doctrine to be found in the canonical writings, was plainly
conceived and formulated to counter the gnosis of Marcion.

</p>
<p>We come
now to the ancient Roman Creed, the date of which is still under discussion, but
probably goes back to the period 150-160: [25]

</p>
<p>&nbsp;I
believe in God, the Father Almighty;<br>
And in
Christ Jesus, his only begotten Son, our Lord,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><br>
who was
born of the holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,<br>
who
under Pontius Pilate was crucified and buried;<br>
the
third day, he rose from the dead,<br>
ascended
to the heavens, sat down at God's right hand,<br>
whence
he will come to judge the quick and the dead;<br>
And in
the holy Spirit, the holy Church, the remission of sins and the resurrection of
the flesh.

</p>
<p align="center">346

</p>
<p>This, in
substance, is the gnosis of Irenaeus, minus the Word and lacking his systematic
balance, but with certain points made more precise for better correspondence
with the Gospels, and always with the same emphasis on the one and only God, the
creator, and on Jesus his only begotten Son, incarnate, dead and risen who will
come again to judge the living and those raised from the dead. Aimed at less
openly, Marcion and his gnosis are here aimed at none the less in reality.

</p>
<p>A point
on no account to be overlooked is that the term here translated &quot;one and
only,&quot; which appears in the Roman Creed, is not to be found in the old
baptismal formula of Rome preserved by Hippolytus. As the second question in his
profession of faith the candidate was asked: &quot;Believest thou in Christ
Jesus the Son of God begotten by Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary?&quot; [26] In
this formula the divine sonship is connected with the virgin conception, as Luke
also connected it (i, 35) in the passage where the virgin conception is
recorded. What the meaning of the baptismal formula really was is shown by the
Liturgy of Hippolytus, [27] where a paraphrase of the Creed reappears in the
Eucharistic prayers:

</p>
<p>We thank
thee, O God, by thy dear child Jesus Christ,<br>
whom in
the last days thou hast sent as saviour and redeemer, and angel of thy will;<br>
who is
thy Word, by whom thou hast made all things;<br>
whom it
pleased thee to send from heaven into a virgin's womb,<br>
and who,
when conceived, became flesh and was revealed thy Son,<br>
born of
holy Spirit and a virgin, etc. [28]

</p>
<p>Needless
to say the line in the above passage concerning the Word is an addition from the
personal theology of Hippolytus, a resolute defender of the Logos and of the
fourth Gospel, like his master Irenaeus. But the part of the formula which
presents Jesus as Son of God in virtue of his being born of God, by the
instrumentality of the holy Spirit and the virgin Mary, corresponds to the
baptismal formula cited immediately above which is earlier than the Roman Creed.
Much older are the terms applied to Jesus, &quot;child&quot; of God, &quot;angel
of his will,&quot; which are nearly related to the Didache, while the second
question

</p>
<p align="center">347

</p>
<p>of the
profession looks as if its original form was only: &quot;Believest thou in
Christ Jesus, the Son of God?&quot; The addition of &quot;only begotten&quot;
after Son, as it is placed in the Roman Symbol, has the effect of making the
sonship an eternal relation existing before the incarnation by miraculous
conception. For that reason some critics hesitate to place the use of the word
as far back as the second century. In any case, however, it might well have been
aimed at Valentinus.

MIRACULOUS CONCEPTION</font>

</p>
<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
<p>At what
date the miraculous conception became an article of the faith remains a matter
for conjecture. Obviously this date depends on that assigned, not precisely to
the composition of the first Gospel, but to its acceptance by the Church in Rome
and to the addition of the verses about the virgin conception in Luke. Not long
ago some excitement was caused by a Syriac manuscript (published by W. Wright in
the Journal of Sacred Literature, October, 1866) in which there is an account of
a Council said to have been held at Rome during the reign of Hadrian in the year
119, Xystus then being bishop. At this Council the questions of the star of the
Magi and of Joseph's marriage are said to have been examined. Many critics have
hesitated to take this information seriously as having anything to do with the
reception of the first Gospel in the Roman Church. Quite recently, however,
Streeter {The Four Gospels, 525) and Bacon (Studies in Matthew, 50-59), both
considerable authorities, have pronounced in favour of a connexion between the
two things. They maintain that a book which, like Matthew, gave the Gospel a
&quot;beginning&quot; other than that of Mark (see Mark i, 1) would not have
been accepted in the Roman Community without further examination and testimony;
but such testimony was forthcoming, and acceptance effected without much
difficulty, because Ignatius of Antioch [29] had recently addressed a warm plea
to Rome in favour of Matthew, highly esteemed at Antioch and by him. The second
argument holds good only on the double condition of the letters of Ignatius
containing the plea being authentic, and the supposed date of his martyrdom
being correct, if even then. This is tantamount to saying the argument

</p>
<p align="center">348

</p>
<p>is not
conclusive. The first argument, which needs very cautious handling, remains to
be considered.

</p>
<p>The
authority of a witness as late as that of this Syriac manuscript (fifth
century), and as isolated, is not indisputable, nor are the ancient sources on
which it might possibly depend (discussed at length by Bacon) and of which, by
some strange chance, it would be the only echo, anything more than a matter of
more or less plausible conjecture. The discussion of its intrinsic probability
would be endless. There is no proof that the canon of the New Testament was
drawn up at Councils properly so called, and decided book by book, and that, as
Bacon contends, the Pastor of Hermas was excluded in this way from the
collection. [30] Moreover, in a case like that of Matthew, the question of its
formal acceptance or rejection would have been impossible in the conditions
under which a Roman Council could have taken place in the year 120. A Gospel
already received in some communities, as Matthew was at Antioch, and coming to
the knowledge of others, was not offered to their official examiners to be
promptly accepted or rejected; it merely asked for the attention of the faithful
and might be long tolerated and held in esteem without entering, to the same
extent as others, into the actual usage of the congregations. It is improbable
that Matthew brought anything new in the way of belief to the Eastern circles
where it first appeared, its compiler merely giving Gospel form to beliefs which
had already taken shape. In the same way when it arrived in Rome its contents
would seem to fall in with what was already known and cannot have made the
impression of bringing information hitherto unheard of. So received, its credit
would increase as time went on.

</p>
<p>It is
nevertheless possible that the period indicated (119-120) corresponds to a
moment of great importance in the history of the Church in Rome. When Irenaeus
reminds Victor that his predecessors tolerated the Easter observance of the
quartodecimans without practising it themselves, he goes back by Soter and
Anicetus to Pius, Hyginus and Telesphorus, and stops at Xystus as though he has
now reached the point from which the Roman tradition takes its departure. It is
not impossible that the Roman observance of the Sunday Easter goes no further
back; but Irenaeus may also have stopped there for lack of

</p>
<p align="center">349

</p>
<p>further
information. In like manner it is not impossible that our first Gospel arrived
in Rome in the time of Xystus and was there received with respect but without
supplanting Mark and Luke, then in use. Nor is it impossible that the growing
credit of Matthew, with its birth story, soon had the effect of introducing into
Luke the addition (i, 34-35) which records the virgin conception of the Christ.
Finally it is not impossible that about 145-150 the miraculous conception of the
Christ was introduced into the baptismal confession of faith, against Valentinus
and especially against Marcion. But all these attempts to fix the date when the
miraculous conception became matter of faith remain in the realm of conjecture.

REMAINING ARTICLES OF THE CREED</font>

</p>
<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
<p>The
article of the remission of sins, in the ancient Roman Symbol, seems to have a
special significance. Impressed by the call of Hermas and his Pastor the Roman
Church may well have established the system of public penitence for Christian
sinners, as a means of defending her discipline against the many
continence-sects then active, and especially against the Marcionites. The
express mention of &quot;the holy Church&quot; aims at canonizing the
traditional Church, the Great Church, the Catholic Church; at establishing it in
the presence, and at the expense, of the gnostic conventicles and suspected
groupings, to which this true Church will henceforth refuse all claims to truth
and to holiness. It is against the gnostics also, and once more against Marcion
in particular, that she affirms &quot;the resurrection of the flesh,&quot;
notwithstanding the declaration of First Corinthians &quot;that flesh and blood
cannot inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (xv,50).

EMERGENCE OF THE EPISCOPATE AND THE CHURCH FULLY BORN</font>

</p>
<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
<p>Impassioned
love for the Church, and for the unity of the Church, goes back to the earliest
organization of the Christian societies; beyond all question it is an
inheritance from the Jewish spirit, in which the idea of a chosen people threw
off its

</p>
<p align="center">350

</p>
<p>national
limitations and became humanized. From the very first the community of believers
in Jesus claimed to be, and was determined to remain, a spiritual homeland for
the elect people of God. Spite of all divisions and, we may add, of many
fallings-away, the Christian groups were kept united in the bond of their faith,
of their great hope and of the fraternal practice of a truly effective charity.
We have already seen how their rudimentary institutions were very naturally
copied from the Synagogue. But they could not fail to undergo profound
transformations of inner ordering in the course of their independent growth to
maturity.

</p>
<p>It was
inevitable, even at the earliest period, that certain members would be charged
with the due ordering of the meetings, chiefly of the communion supper, and with
the care of the poor. The Book of Acts represents the Apostles as the first
administrators of the community but soon forced to delegate the service of its
material wants to seven deacons (vi, 1-6). The story is fictitious, but
corresponds to one reality — that the Christian communities were organized
brotherhoods from the very beginning. From the moment the groups were formed,
the older men, assisted by auxiliary ministers, took the place of presidents;
there were presbyters, deacons and even deaconesses. At the end of First
Corinthians (xvi, 15-16) Paul mentions one Stephanas and those of his household,
&quot;first fruits of Achaia, who have taken on themselves the service of the
saints,&quot; that is, the first to be converted who, ever since their
conversion, have devoted themselves to the community; and he then goes on to
plead that obedience should be rendered to them and to every helper who labours
as they did for the common good. It would seem, then, that Stephanas and his
fellow workers had already the duty of supervising as well as of serving, and
were charged, as a kind of police, with the maintenance of discipline. At the
end of Romans, Paul, in like manner, speaks of &quot;the sister Phoebe,&quot;
deaconess of the community at Cenchrea, who has the duty of carrying his letter,
a person worthy of all respect &quot;because she has been a help to many,
including myself.&quot; With no titles or honorific badges to distinguish them
from other believers, and though they had not received the indelible mark of
sacramental ordination, these people were of no little con-

</p>
<p align="center">351

</p>
<p>sequence
in the community. It is, however, true that the ordination of elders,
bishop-priests and deacons, by the laying-on of hands, is of earlier date than
the editing of Acts and the pastoral Epistles, perhaps even earlier than the
Didache.

</p>
<p>At no
period of their history did the communities allow these indispensable officers
to drop out. The presence of apostles, prophets and doctors may have left them
at first somewhat in the shade, but did not render them less necessary. In First
Corinthians (xii, 4-5) &quot;service&quot; is placed below &quot;spiritual
gifts.&quot; The Didache gives these helpers greater honour, but still finds it
necessary to urge consideration for them in the community which has elected them
to office. This is no longer determined by circumstances or by their own wish to
serve, as it was at the beginning.

</p>
<p>&quot;Choose
you bishops and deacons [31] worthy of the Lord; let them be gentle men,
disinterested, sincere, well-tried. For they also exercise among you the
ministry of prophets and doctors; look not upon them as of low rank, for they
are entitled to respect among you along with prophets and doctors.&quot; (Didache,
31.)

</p>
<p>The
status of elders, as Hermas describes it, is almost the same, except that they
are now acquiring greater authority and are beginning to take precedence of the
prophets and the doctors.

</p>
<p>The
&quot;overseers,&quot; or bishops, were not distinguished from the elders, or
priests. The elders are also the overseers; the &quot;ministers,&quot; or
deacons, are subordinate to them. In the Pastoral Epistles three orders of
administrative officers are no longer recognized, but only two, the
bishop-priests and the deacons. [32[ Thus each community, on becoming fairly
numerous, would have a collegium of elders presiding over its social life,
meetings for worship and works of charity; the deacons would form the executive.
But though, at the outset, the elders had no teaching ministry by the side of
the prophets and doctors, and though even the moral discipline of the
congregation did not belong to them, the force of circumstances would,
nevertheless, tend to give them a leading part, not only in discipline, but in
the day to day instruction of catechumens and those already baptized. The
importance of their administrative function would increase with the increase of
the common resources to be managed and of the alms to be distributed, with the
growing sacredness of

</p>
<p align="center">352

</p>
<p>their
duties in the conduct of worship and the concurrent decline and inadequacy of
inspired prophecy and itinerant preaching. The Didache (n, 3-5) gives us a
glimpse of the latter process; the wandering apostle was now becoming a
burdensome charge on the localized congregations and ill-seen by the managers of
their funds. [33] At Rome, in the time of Hermas, the prophetteacher was already
under the control of the presbyters, who soon set him aside altogether and
themselves assumed sole charge of the day to day instruction of the
congregation. The author of the Ignatian Letters speaks as though his own office
were that of bishop-prophet and not as though the prophets were a separate order
at the side of the bishops, priests and deacons. When Marcion tried to revive
the prophets it was too late.

</p>
<p>We can
now understand why the pastoral Epistles dwell on the qualities needed in the
bishop-priest and in the deacon with an insistence that seems striving to find
terms strong enough. For, in reality, it is to them, not to the prophets nor to
the teachers (doctors), that the &quot;Paul&quot; of the pastorals, through the
intermediary of Timothy and Titus, commits the whole care of the congregations
now menaced by a swarm of heretical doctrinaires. To Titus he writes as follows
(i, 5-9):

</p>
<p>To this
end I left thee in Crete,<br>
that
thou mightest complete what is unfinished,<br>
And
appoint presbyters in every town,<br>
according
to the order I gave thee.<br>
Let each
be a man above reproach,<br>
the
husband of one wife, [34]<br>
With
believing children,<br>
not
suspected as ne'er-do-wells or disobedient.<br>
For the
bishop must be irreproachable,<br>
inasmuch
as he is God's steward:<br>
Not
arrogant, not hasty tempered, not given to drink,<br>
not a
man of blows, not avaricious,<br>
But a
kindly host, a good man, having common sense,<br>
just,
pious, master of himself,<br>
Holding
fast the sure word which accords with the doctrine,<br>
so that
he can exhort in holy teaching,<br>
and send
opponents to the right-about.

</p>
<p>From
this it becomes clear that the bishop-priest is now charged with the paternal
government of the community and

</p>
<p align="center">353

</p>
<p>with the
instruction of it according to &quot;the doctrine&quot; deemed apostolic.
Obviously the office is not for new and untried hands, a point expressly made in
the Epistles to Timothy (i, 3-4; v, 22; 2, ii, 2).

</p>
<p>Let the
deacons likewise be worthy men,<br>
not
using words in a double sense,<br>
And not
addicted to the wine cup,<br>
not
avaricious,<br>
Having
the mystery of the faith<br>
in
purity of conscience<br>
But see
to it also that they are first proved,<br>
then let
them serve, being without reproach;<br>
For
those who do good service<br>
win for
themselves a position of honour<br>
And
great assurance by faith in Christ Jesus.

</p>
<p>When and
how the bishop emerged from the general body of presbyters as sole president of
the community, cannot be stated with precision. It is probable that from the
very earliest time this body was not constituted without a head, that it had a
president, but that his office did not exalt him very highly above his fellows
and was not an appointment for life. It is noteworthy that Hermas, whose
tradition makes him out to be the brother of the bishop Pius, predecessor of
Anicetus, never mentions the bishop, and seems to have had dealings only with
the presbyters in Rome. But a few years afterwards we find Anicetus sole bishop
of the Roman community, just as his contemporary Polycarp was sole bishop in
Smyrna. But Polycarp had then been bishop for a long time. It may well be that
the monarchical type of episcopate existed in some regions earlier than in
others. Polycarp himself, for example, writing to the Philippians makes no
mention of any bishop at Philippi. [35] The community of Corinth, again, seems
to have had no bishop at its head when the letter of Clement was addressed to
it. This letter shows knowledge only of bishop-priests and of deacons,
instituted by the apostles in the communities they had founded, and reappointed
by election after the apostle's death. The letter does not speak of these
functionaries as subject to recall at will or periodically, but as there for
life. [36]

</p>
<p>We may
conclude, then, that the monarchical type of episco-

</p>
<p align="center">354

</p>
<p>pate was
at first instituted in certain communities, either because they were more
prepared than the others for an autocratic regime, or through the pressure of
personalities better endowed for leadership and ambitious to attain it. Have we
not already heard the good Hermas rebuking the Roman presbyters for their love
of place and power? On that road Asia may well have taken the lead of Greece
proper, and especially of Rome, where perhaps there was some difficulty in
centralizing the Christian groups under a single administration. It is likely
enough that the gnostic peril brought this evolution to a sudden head; for while
the unitary episcopate exists only in some places before the period 130-140, we
find it existing everywhere after 150-160. Be it observed, moreover, that
Marcion, who founded his communities on the pattern of the Great Church,
recognized the distinction between episcopate, presbyterate and deaconate. These
functions, however, were not perpetual in the Marcionite communities and did not
form a true hierarchy. The tendency of the arch-heretic was, so to say, in the
direction of democratizing church appointments, while the Church, on the other
side, proceeded to fortify them more and more by an official conservation, which
ended by separating the clergy from the lay believers. [37] In the Church,
priests and deacons became united in one body, under the rule of the bishop, to
guide the Christian flock in the path of apostolic doctrine. Bishops, priests,
deacons, these three, while retaining their function as ministers of charity,
are now to be acknowledged as masters of the truth and hierarchs of the cult.

</p>
<p>Meanwhile
the gap which divides the Church from the heresies grows deeper and more
distinct. Celsus (c. 180) clearly distinguishes the one from the other. But,
more profoundly than an outsider like Celsus could feel it, the difference
between orthodox and heretical was realized within the Church, which its
official representatives and apologists are now declaring to be the sole
guardian of the truth. Justin, who attributes pagan idolatry to wicked demons,
does not hesitate to make them the authors of all the heresies from Simon Magus
to Marcion (i Apology, 26, 58). &quot;There is not a doubt,&quot; Tertullian
will soon be saying, &quot;that the spirits of perversity, from whom come the
heresies, were charged with the business by the devil, nor that heresies are the
same as

</p>
<p align="center">355

</p>
<p>idolatry,
seeing that they come from the same author and are of the same workmanship.
Either they invent another God to oppose the creator&quot; — this for Marcion
— &quot;or, if they admit only one creator they make him out to be different
from what he really is. Thus every lie they tell about God is some sort of
service to idols&quot; (De Praescriptione, 40).

</p>
<p>We have
already heard the author of the Ignatian Letters sounding his trumpet call to
the faithful to rally round the bishop. Let us listen once more to this singer
of Christian unity — unity in bishops and by bishops. For he it is who may be
truly said to have created the mystery of the episcopate, that mystery of which
Cyprian, in the next century, was to be the worthy exponent, and which to-day
would be condemned as heresy, being now replaced by the mystery of the Pope, of
which our authors had not the faintest idea.

</p>
<p>Since
love permits me not to keep silence towards you, I am eager in exhorting you to
walk in step with the thought of God. For Jesus Christ, the life we can never be
parted from, is the thought of God, even as bishops, established in their seats
to the end of the earth, are one with the thought of Jesus Christ. Fitting it
is, then, that you walk in step with the thought of the bishop, as indeed you
are doing. For your venerable presbyterium is adjusted to the bishop as cords
are adjusted to the lyre. Wherefore Christ is praised by the harmony of your
hearts and the symphony of your love. Join you, each one, his voice to that
choir, so that, with one heart and one voice, taking up in unison the key-note
of God, you may sing through Jesus Christ to the Father, who will then listen to
your song and recognize by your works that you are members of His Son. Good is
it for you that you keep in faultless unity, for thus will you ever be united to
the very God. (Ephesians 3-4.)

SUDDEN REVIVAL OF CHRISTIAN PROPHECY</font>

</p>
<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
<p>At the
moment when this admirable symphony was about to become complete, it had a
narrow escape of being broken up by the discordant cries of the Christian
prophets. Christian prophecy, as we have seen, was on the way to dying a natural
death in the atmosphere created by the intellectualism of gnosis and the growth
of the episcopate, which was fighting gnosis and growing stronger as it fought.
But all of a sudden, between 160 and 170, [38] prophecy came to life again in a
region which had long been

</p>
<p align="center">356

</p>
<p>accustomed
to outbreaks of mystical transport. Montanus, with his -women acolytes,
Maximilla and Priscilla, exalted it seems by overstudy of the Johannine
writings, were persuaded that a mission had been laid upon them to revive the
golden days of Christian prophecy. Great was the emotional excitement in all the
congregations of God, beginning from those in Asia Minor, when news spread that
astounding manifestations of the Spirit were taking place in Phrygia; an
excitement which became the more confused when it was learnt at the same time
that the new prophets were encountering vigorous opposition, especially from the
bishops, who were actively at work in refuting the prophets and were going to
the length of having them exorcised as possessed of the devil.

</p>
<p>As with
other heresies, our information about Montanus and Montanism comes mainly from
those who opposed them. But Montanus was not a real heretic; at least there was
nothing of the gnostic about him. He and his adepts were illuminati who had been
carried away by the Book of Revelation and expected to see the New Jerusalem
descending at an exact spot, which their visions had revealed to them, between
the small Phrygian towns of Pepuza and Tymon. Far from the scene of their
excesses the Montanists were looked upon with favour in 177 at Lyons where
Irenaeus the bishop showed them consistent goodwill. Rome hesitated long before
taking sides. [39] It was while affairs were in this posture that certain
Asiatics, by way of turning Montanus and his followers to mockery, rejected the
whole of the Johannine books. For Montanism lasted on and was getting organized
round Pepuza undeterred by the persistent delay of the heavenly Jerusalem in
making its appearance. Rome, under Victor, and in the first years of Zephyrinus,
took no pains to be on good terms with the Asiatic bishops, and this may explain
why Caius (180-235) was able with impunity to join the Asiatic adversaries of
the Paraclete, the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. In this Caius was also
attacking Montanism.

</p>
<p>The
violence of the agitation caused by this revival of Christian prophecy was not
confined to Asia Minor. Though most of the Asiatic bishops were against the
movement, it got a lasting hold in Phrygia, where the headquarters of its hopes
were established. But its localization in that province did not hinder its
missionaries

</p>
<p align="center">357

</p>
<p>from
going far into the West. Only in Africa was Montanism able to take root, and
there it won over Tertullian, the greatest of the Church's apologists in that
age. Great as was the effort made by Tertullian to rally the Church to Montanism,
he succeeded no further than to bring about his own secession towards the year
201 [40] taking with him a small group of followers who never counted for much
in African Christianity, though they managed to hold on till the time of Saint
Augustine.

</p>
<p>The
historical significance of Montanism lies in the fact that here we have a
rekindling of the inner fire whose light illuminated the first believers. The
medium in which that fire sprang up again was doubtless favourable to such an
outbreak, but the movement is best understood as a reaction of faith against
gnosis, a reaction, that is, of the mystic sense against metaphysical subtleties
pretending to be a philosophy of religion. It was also a movement of rigorist
morality, a continence-movement proceeding from a principle different from
Marcion's but not less exacting. Montanus condemned marriage by arguments which
pushed to its last consequences the reasoning by which celibacy and virginity
are commended to the faithful in First Corinthians (vii, 6-8, 25-34). Both in
its revival of prophecy and in its rigorist morality Montanism ran counter to
tendencies manifested in the Church during the second century towards a more
flexible discipline, and a more solid organization, than the first age of
Christianity would have found congenial. On the one hand, the Church was
building herself into a fortress by submitting to the rule of a monarchical
episcopate; on the other, she was adapting herself to the conditions of human
society by allowing for the wants, even the weaknesses, of human nature, and by
establishing a discipline of penitence for those whose courage might fail in
professing their faith when threatened with death for profession, or who might
commit any other sin incompatible with the principle of Christianity. Far from
yielding to the Montanist movement, the episcopate was now strong enough to
deprive prophecy of any part in the direction of the Christian conscience and to
set up a relatively indulgent regime for the Christian sinner, but always on
condition of his penitence.

</p>
<p>The
check thus given to Montanism marks the end of primitive Christianity. From that
time onwards the Christian religion is the

</p>
<p align="center">358

</p>
<p>Christian
Church under the rule of bishops accounted successors of the apostles and
trustees of the apostolic tradition. This Church has her Creed, of which the
essential lines are now firmly drawn. She has her Scriptures, a collection of
the New Testament, supported by the Old. Her worship has evolved into a Mystery
of Salvation. Her whole institution is now defined sufficiently, not indeed to
render future heresy impossible, but to ensure that henceforth, and century
after century, the life of the Christian communities shall be ruled with
sovereign right by the principle of tradition, or seem to be ruled, when the
reins of government are in able hands.

</p>
<p>So our
story concludes. A religious agitation started in Palestinian Judaism by a
Galilean preacher, whose aim was the Kingdom of God, and his end to be crucified
as a rebel, comes to its fruit in less than two centuries as a mighty
institution established throughout the Roman empire, condemned by the law, but
assured of its future and equally sure of victory over the empire which
persecuted it. In the whole course of this remarkable evolution nothing happened
which cannot be explained by the laws that govern human life, and this may be
said with confidence in spite of the obscurity resulting from the conditions
under which the movement went on its way. None the less is it true that this
triumph of faith, viewed in the light of religious and moral consciousness, if
not a miracle, is a human marvel, in which new life was created and a work of
human progress thereby accomplished. The diffusion of Judaism had prepared the
ground for Christian success, but Christianity completed a victory which
Judaism, though it won the first approaches, was powerless to follow up to its
conclusion, and this because it had compressed an idea, broad as humanity, into
the narrow form of a nationalism, in which only a few could participate. This
idea Christianity held forth, under the thin covering of a religious creed, to
the disinherited multitudes of the ancient world, to the multitudes without a
homeland; and round it they rallied. This element of human sympathy, born in the
first preaching of the Gospel and developed in primitive Christianity, this it
was that carried the Catholic Church to the very forefront of history. How she
has since comported herself at that eminence, in what measure she has fulfilled
or not fulfilled her programme,

</p>
<p align="center">359

</p>
<p>we know.
But the history other proceedings from the end of the second century down to our
time is abundantly documented. It is the pre-history of the Christian religion
that we here bring to an end, a history which the cautious inquirer may
reconstruct by inference, and more or less conjecturally, from testimony whose
main content is, not the history, but the mystic legend of its institution.
