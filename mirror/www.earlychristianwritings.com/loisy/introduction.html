<center><h2>AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION</h2></center>
<P>
THE present study of the origin of the Christian religion comes
in sequence to that which the author has recently published on the
religion of Israel, the mention of which suffices to render another
introduction unnecessary. A complete translation of the New
Testament has also been edited [1] which, to some extent, supplies
the documentation and critical discussion behind the present
synthesis, while the synthesis completes that volume by placing
the New Testament writings, and the other sources of primitive
Christian history, in their original setting.
<P>
Needless to say, a synthesis of this kind can be no more than an
essay, related as closely as possible to the present state of knowledge, but making no pretence to offer a definite solution of all
the problems raised by the birth of the Christian religion;
problems concerning the character of the evangelical writings and
the Epistles attributed to the apostle Paul; problems concerning
the evolution of the religion from its point of departure in Judaism
until the time when the Church, in the last quarter of the second
century, is seen building itself up, in opposition to a flood of
gnostic systems, on the base of a tradition alleged to be apostolic,
of which the New Testament is held to be the witness, and the
episcopate called catholic claims to be the authorized interpreter
or guardian.
<P>
The author of this book makes humble avowal of not having
yet discovered that Jesus never existed. The conjectures by which
some among us, in these latter days, would explain the Christian
religion without him whom that religion regards as its founder
have always seemed to him as fragile as they are vociferous. These
conjectures come, for the most part, from persons who have
arrived somewhat late at the problem of Jesus, and not all of
whom have prepared for that problem by deep study of the
history of Israel's religion or of the Christian. For them the non-existence of Jesus forms part of a philosophical system, except
where it proceeds from polemical interests avowed or discreetly
veiled. Long ago the Christ was discovered by Dupuis to be a
solar myth; Bruno Bauer and the Dutch school (Van Manen
excepted) make him out to be a pure creation of Alexandrian allego-
<P>
<center>11</center>
<P>
rists, in which they are followed by W. B. Smith, Drews and
Robertson. In France P. L-Couchoud (<i>Le mystere de Jesus</i>) and
E. Dujardin (<i>Le Dieu Jesus</i>) have each struck out on a line of his
own; Couchoud postulating a pre-Christian myth of a suffering
Jahveh (!) which a vision of Simon Peter suddenly transformed
into a living religion; Dujardin, a pre-Christian worship of Jesus
with the fictitious crucifixion of an individual playing the part of a
god, the Christian religion having its origin in the last exhibition
of this pageant, which also gives the date of its birth.
<P>
These hypotheses all share in a common defect: they are air-drawn fabrics and they do not explain the birth of the Christian
religion. For the part played by myth in the Christian tradition
concerning Jesus is as undeniable as it was inevitable in the
origins of the Christian movement; but the witness to the
Christian fact does not entirely dissolve into a myth, and the fact
itself is not a myth. The messianic myth supports Jesus, but Jesus
together with the myth support the Christian religion; the
distinctively Christian myth of Jesus-God did not exist before
Christianity, but was formed inside that religion, and formed
stage by stage, to the glory of Jesus. The Christian myth of
salvation was, in a manner, called into being and set on foot by
Jesus himself, to be afterwards elaborated in the first age of the
Christian religion. The testimony and the facts being what they
are, the mythical theory unduly simplifies the problem of Christian
origins, which it does more to obscure than to illuminate. In
the <i>Revue Critique</i>, 1925 (pp. 343-347) the present author wrote as
follows: "the part played by myth in the birth of Christianity is
more easily determined by the historian than is the part played by
Jesus himself. While the Christian religion was not created by
myth alone, so, certainly, it was not created by Jesus alone; its
creator was neither Jesus without the myth, nor the myth without
Jesus. Jesus the Nazorean is at once an historical person and a
mythical being who, supporting the myth and supported by it,
was finally made by it into the Christ, Lord and God, for the
faith which so acknowledged him. To say this is not to reduce the
part of Jesus to an occasional cause. On the other hand, to
present, as the sole and total cause of Christianity, one human
being who, considered as divine, was also the very object worshipped
by that religion would only be to create another myth."
<P>
<center>12</center>
<P>
It is however true that the ancient testimonies do not permit us
to reconstitute the human figure of Jesus, his personal doings, the
meaning of his career and its chief circumstances, with full and
unfaltering certitude.
<P>
That Jesus was one among a number of agitators and enthusiasts
who appeared in Judea between the years 6 and 70 of our era;
that his appearance is to be placed towards the middle of this
period or the beginning of its third; that it had, in one form or
another, a messianic character; that Jesus was crucified as a
pretended Messiah by sentence of Pontius Pilate—all this has the
highest degree of probability; to be more exact, the whole
Christian movement becomes unintelligible if these beginnings
are suppressed. No consistent argument authorizes their elimination and there is nothing to replace them. But what idea had
Jesus of his mission, if even he had any precise idea? What did he
hope for and aim at? What was his message and on what special
charge was he condemmed to death? How were his followers
grouped round him and on what grounds did they become convinced after his death that he was still alive, immortal, powerful
and glorified at the right hand of God? How was Christ Jesus
presently sublimated into Jesus the God-saviour? These are
questions which the evidence does not permit us to answer with
complete certitude and in detail. And the most brilliant hypotheses brought forward to answer them are not necessarily the
best founded.
<P>
The Tradition which has preserved for us the memory of Jesus
was at its origin entirely different from historical tradition. From
the very beginning it was a tradition of faith, and almost immediately
afterwards the tradition of a cult which grew continually
more impassioned and developed until it attained complete
deification of its object. Memory, in a word, was transfigured into
faith and adoration. In all strictness the Gospels are not historical
documents. They are catechisms for use in common worship,
containing the cult-legend of the Lord Jesus Christ; that, and no
other, is the content they announce; that, and no other, is the
quality they claim. Even Luke, which assumes a high degree of
editorial exactitude, set out to be, before all else, "sound instruction in the Word"—as we should say, "a good manual of
Christian initiation" (i, 1-4). Even the teaching attributed to
<P>
<center>13</center>
<P>
Jesus is constructed, for the most part, to meet the needs of
Christian propaganda, for the edification of the earliest communities, or, yet again, especially in the fourth Gospel, to elaborate a mystical theory of salvation by Jesus Christ. We cannot
complacently assume that we are able clearly to recognize, behind
all these elaborations of faith, the real features of Jesus, his
personal activities and the precise circumstances of his ministry
and death. What the historian sees directly before him in all this is
the faith of the first Christian generations and the intensity of
their devotion to Jesus, the Saviour.
<P>
There is nothing to make good this insufficiency of the Gospel
evidence. The Acts of the Apostles, supposed to narrate the
history of the first Christian age, contain the legend and, in some
respects, the myth rather than the history of it, insomuch that the
general perspective of the book is, in its own way, as artificial as
that of the Gospels, if not more so. The Epistles known as apostolic have been edited in the same spirit as the Gospels and with
likelihood hardly greater of being the work of the authors to
whom they are attributed. Little by little it has perforce been
admitted that the Gospels are not the personal works of
individual writers, and that the traditional attribution of these
books to apostles or to apostolic men is contestable in every
instance. It has also at length been recognized that a false authorship has been attributed to several Epistles and that their date is
uncertain: cases in point are Hebrews, Ephesians, second Thessalonians and the Epistles known as catholic. Furthermore it has
become impossible not to recognize traces of compilation in the
two Epistles to the Corinthians, and the conclusion has followed
that they were composed by amalgamating matter drawn from a
much larger number of authentic letters. Even bolder conjectures,
not only for the two Epistles in question, but for Romans, first
Thessalonians and perhaps others, might be reasonably defended.
The obvious doctrinal incoherence between the Epistles, and
often in the same Epistle, would thus find a better explanation
than that afforded by the restlessness of mind with a super-abundant endowment of which the Apostle is usually credited.
Thus the question arises of whether the theories of redemption
brought forward in the Epistles called Pauline are really those of
the Apostle. Or do they represent flights of gnostic speculation
<P>
<center>14</center>
<P>
later than Paul but earlier than the chief systems of heretical
gnosticism?
<P>
In the next chapter we shall see how limited are the resources
which other Christian documents anterior to the year 180 offer to
the critical historian. We feel therefore entitled to remark, in
terminating this preamble, that while every history of Christian
origins rests, admittedly or not, on more or less shaky foundations,
the fault is not necessarily attributable to the historian who
tries to write that history, but to the condition of the evidence
on which he has to base it. For that reason we here make no
pretence to give a finished and balanced picture of the birth of the
Christian religion. Our aim will be to show forth with simplicity
what seem the most probable conclusions in this delicate
matter, as they offer and prove themselves to our own mind.
