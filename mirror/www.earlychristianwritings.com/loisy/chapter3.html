<center><h2><i>Chapter III</i></h2></center>
<P>
<center><h2>BIRTH OF THE BELIEF IN JESUS AS THE CHRIST</h2></center>
<P>
WE have seen that the circumstances of Jesus' death are far from being defined
in their details, even in those which would be of considerable importance to the
historian, such as the date, now impossible to determine not only as to the day,
but equally so, and primarily, as to the year. A still deeper obscurity reigns
over the question now to come before us. Under what conditions did the disciples
of Jesus acquire their faith in the victory over death which they quickly came
to believe had been. won by the Master they had lost: under what conditions did
they acquire the eager desire, the strong will, the firm resolution, to spread
this faith abroad as the sole means of admission to the Kingdom of God which
Jesus, now glorified as the risen Christ, would soon bring down to earth?
<p>We may assume that Jesus was crucified in one of the years between 26 and 29
and that the event occurred a little before the feast of the Passover. How then
shall we explain the reaction of the disciples to a blow which might well have
shattered their faith, but which actually ended by exalting it to new heights?
In what conditions did they set about the propagation of the faith thus newly
enhanced? How came it to pass that the propagation of it was so promptly carried
beyond the borders of Palestine? These are questions which legend and myth have
answered with much assurance and equal simplicity, but to which probable answers
based on certain significant traces, debris of a deposit left by a true
tradition and not entirely overlaid by legend and myth, are the best answers the
historian is able to offer.</p>
<P>
<center><font size=+1>1. COLLAPSE AND RECOVERY OF THE DISCIPLES' FAITH</font></center>
<P>
On the evening of the day when Jesus breathed his last, no man living could have
foreseen the incomparable future awaiting the unfortunate prophet whose hopes of
a renovated world had&nbsp;
<P align="center">
90
<p>received from the course of events a refutation so
complete and so cruel. The executioners who took down his body from the cross
doubtless flung it, perhaps after giving a finishing blow to the half-dead
sufferer, into some trench reserved for those deemed unworthy of honourable
burial, in conformity with the Jewish law which forbad the bodies of executed
criminals to be exposed after sunset. Perhaps the place of burial was &quot;the
field of blood,&quot; Aceldama, [1] to which Christian tradition has clumsily
tacked on the legend of Judas, making Judas into a substitute for him who was
not to be thought of as buried for ever in such a place. However that may be,
the legend of the laying-out and burial of the body by Joseph of Arimathea,
conceived as the fulfilment of prophecy (probably Isaiah liii, 9) and of one
piece with the apologetic fiction of the empty tomb, is also a fiction.</p>
<p>The usual practice was to cast the body of an executed
criminal into the common grave, unless the family obtained permission to bury it
in their own way. At the time when the tradition was born it was known that in
the case of Jesus nobody intervened. But later on, when the need was felt to
give the Christ an honourable burial, which the family was thought unable to do,
tradition imagined for the part a person of consideration alike for his social
standing and character. But the invention of Joseph of Arimathea to play the
part of intervener is a perceptible artifice, so, too, is the invention of
women, in default of the disciples then in flight, as the most likely witnesses
of the burial and afterwards of the resurrection. Even in the Fourth Gospel we
get glimpses of an older story in the background which represented the
executioners as putting the body into a grave that chanced to be at hand near
the place of execution. [2] The stories in Mark about the burial and the tomb
found empty are fictions which the other evangelists have elaborated so as to
give them a better consistency. The object aimed at was to furnish the
resurrection with a proof hitherto unthought of. The part played by women in
funeral rites suggested the Galilean women, who, having ministered to Jesus in
his native province, might be supposed to have followed him to Jerusalem, been
present at his passion on Calvary, then at his burial and finally to have found
his tomb unoccupied. Joseph of Arimathea was the male figure indispensable for
decency of burial and boldly selected as a</p>
<P align="center">
91&nbsp;
</p>
<p>member of the Sanhedrim. Pilate, before granting the
authority demanded for the removal, is informed by the centurion that Jesus is
quite dead — a point intended to meet the theory, brought forward in a
controversy between Jews and Christians, that the body had been carried away
before death, neither party knowing more than the other how the matter had
really gone.
</p>
<p>Mark makes Joseph buy a new winding sheet: according to the
other evangelists the tomb is also a new one; [3] the Synoptics describe it as
hewn out of the rock — doubtless in fulfilment of prophecies such as Isaiah
xxii, 16, xxxiii, 16. The great stone blocking the entrance is intended to
enhance the miracle of the resurrection. [4] John adds to Joseph a second male
figure in the person of Nicodemus, a figure peculiar to this evangelist; to give
the burial a higher dignity and to complete the symbolism he has Jesus embalmed,
contradicting the Synoptics. All this is supposed to take place on the evening
of Friday so as to keep Jesus in the tomb for the whole of the Sabbath and a few
hours of the following night; this has the secondary purpose of excluding the
theory that the body had been carried off. With the same purpose, but more
directly, Matthew has the fantastic fiction of a guard of soldiers stationed at
the tomb. But the main object of the whole arrangement is to make the
resurrection take place on the day of the Sun, which thus becomes the day of the
Risen Lord. Apologetic and symbolism are thus equally satisfied. [5]
</p>
<p>The discovery of the empty tomb by women is arranged in
Mark with surprising artlessness. Never has fiction more childish found so many
to believe it true. The concluding statement &quot;they said nothing to any man,
because they were afraid,&quot; which suppresses the testimony invented for
them, by leaving it with no guarantee but the word of the evangelist, has the
simple and very evident object of explaining how the discovery of the empty tomb
was unknown to anybody until the moment when here recorded by him. As this
plainly will not do, the other evangelists have taken pains to improve upon it,
and first of all by omitting Mark's unfortunate explanation. Matthew, Luke and
John [6] all release the tied tongues of the women. But in spite of all they can
do to improve on Mark it is clear enough that the whole story came into the
tradition long after the accounts of visions and apparitions on
</p>
<p align="center">92&nbsp;</p>
<p>which the earliest faith was nourished; and equally clear
that the connexion is artificial throughout between the story of the empty tomb,
with its secondary purpose of authorizing the Roman custom of celebrating Easter
on Sunday, and the oldest recollections, whether concerned with visions of the
Risen Christ or with the beginnings of Christian preaching. A like artificiality
may be discerned in the way the burial by Joseph of Arimathea is bound together
with the discovery of the empty tomb. But, though of earlier date than the story
of the empty tomb, that of the burial by Joseph is no better founded on reality.
[7]

</p>
<p>The dead Jesus was left to his fate. But what became of the
memory of him? What became of the faith he inspired in his disciples? It is
certain that his arrest and execution put a stop for the time being to the
proclamation of his message, and equally certain that the preaching of it by
apostles did not begin in Jerusalem till some time had elapsed after the tragic
end. How long the interval was cannot be exactly discerned, for the chronology
in Acts is artificial and bound up with an imaginary and tendentious account of
the facts. The perspective unrolled in the first two chapters of Acts, which are
continuous with the end of Luke, omits entirely what may be called the
interregnum of the faith or, more strictly, its period of crisis. It reveals
nothing of the confusion into which the disciples were plunged by the arrest and
death of Jesus, nor of their flight into Galilee nor of the real conditions
under which their faith was re-established by the conviction that Jesus, risen
from the dead, was about to return in glory as the Christ. Suppressing all this,
Luke and Acts keep the disciples in Jerusalem, limiting the period of their
anguish almost to the time while the Christ was in his tomb, and making them the
recipients of a new and higher initiation, which begins on the very evening of
the resurrection, is then continued for forty days by instructions from the
Risen Christ in person, and consummated by the descent of the Holy Ghost and the
foundation of the Catholic and Apostolic Church on the day of Pentecost. All of
which is gnosis [8] and fiction, disguising a highly complex reality, the
fiction serving only to baffle our conjectures as to the real course of events.

</p>
<p>As Jesus cannot have been allowed to teach in Jerusalem for
any length of time, if indeed lie was able to teach there at all,

</p>
<p align="center">93</p>
<p>it is improbable that he recruited many followers in that
city. Thus the whole future of the Gospel came to depend on the believers from
Galilee, the most ardent and faithful of whom, or at least those who were his
regular followers, had doubtless accompanied him to Jerusalem. The third Gospel
and Acts, as we have seen, keep them in Jerusalem, under the express order of
Jesus, to the hour of Pentecost when their preaching is supposed to have begun.
In this way the ministry of Jesus is prolonged after his death up to the time of
his ascension into heaven; some days are then passed in prayer during which a
twelfth apostle is chosen by lot to fill the place of Judas until finally, on
the day of Pentecost, regarded as the anniversary of the promulgation of the
Law, the Spirit descends from heaven upon the apostles and opens its victorious
activity in the Church by the public preaching of Peter. All this is artificial
and of late origin. The institution of the Twelve is not likely to have preceded
the organization of the earliest community, while the idea of the Church as the
Kingdom of the Spirit and a kind of substitute for the Reign of God, whose
coming it still awaits, is relatively recent and certainly later than the
foundation of the first groups of hellenizing Christians. We may add that the
object the apostolic preaching is said to have aimed at — that of proving the
Gospel by the fulfilment of prophecies (Luke xxiv, 43-47) — is not that with
which it really began, but presupposes the evangelical tradition already grown
to the form represented by the common source of the Synoptics. [9]

</p>
<p>The sum of the matter comes then to this: the perspective
of Luke and Acts, in itself symbolic throughout, is radically false from the
historian's point of view. It deliberately contradicts an older and more
probable tradition according to which the followers of Jesus returned at once
into Galilee. It is true that this tradition, in the form in which it has come
down to us, has already taken up a legendary element in the texts which inform
us that Jesus, before his death, appointed a rendezvous with his disciples in
Galilee, and that the order to repair to Galilee was repeated by the angel whom
the women found in the empty tomb. All that is pure fiction, conceived for the
purpose of disguising the collapse of the disciples, and their flight into
Galilee in presence of the catastrophe which fell on their leader,

</p>
<p align="center">94</p>
<p>and, at the same time, of buttressing the myth of the
resurrection. Had the disciples really remained in Jerusalem and there found
confirmation of their faith, the tradition would not have started by localizing
the apparitions of the Risen Christ in Galilee. But the fiction of the
rendezvous in Galilee proved somewhat embarrassing; for, if the disciples were
actually in Jerusalem on the morning of the resurrection, why were they sent to
distant Galilee to get the evidence of it in apparitions of the Christ risen
from the dead? Luke (xxiv, 6) gets out of the difficulty by substituting for the
rendezvous in Galilee the reminder of a prediction made by Jesus in Galilee to
the effect that he would suffer and rise again; after which Luke localizes all
the apparitions in Jerusalem. The perspective is still further distorted in the
fourth Gospel, [10] where we find it completely upset by the addition of the
last chapter, an overload impossible to fit in with the setting of chapter xx.
All this elaborate staging, constructed for the purpose of providing an entrance
into evangelical history for the resurrection-myth, and of adjusting thereto the
origin of Christian preaching, comes to one result — that of obscuring, if not
rendering quite undiscoverable, the real sequence of events between the
execution of Jesus and the dawn of apostolic activity in Jerusalem. The
scripture version of the tradition has thus created, but without perceiving it,
an irreducible gap in its own evidence, thanks to which the mythologues of our
time have been able to produce their theory that Jesus never existed.

</p>
<p>We can well believe that Jerusalem was a dangerous place
for the disciples after the arrest of their Master. The circumstances of the
arrest seem to have been such that none of them was caught; doubtless the affair
had gone too swiftly to give the authorities time to pick them out at the
prophet's side. The instant his doom was pronounced they made off in all haste
to their own country, overwhelmed by the blow which had struck down their leader
and having no thought for the moment but that of their own safety. To call them
disillusioned by the terrible outcome would not be strictly .accurate;
disillusion would imply a fuller participation in the tragedy than had actually
been theirs, were it only to the extent of seeing with their own eyes the
ignominy of their leader's execution and

</p>
<p align="center">95</p>
<p>burial which they did not see. But they were in utter
consternation and amazement and needed a little time and freedom from danger to
pull themselves together. The shock was violent; but their faith had a deep root
and was bound in course of time to assert itself against the violence of the
shock. And this reaction would come the more easily inasmuch as they knew only
by rumour of the horror of the crucifixion and the infamy of the burial.

</p>
<p>According to the tradition their faith was awakened, or
rather created anew, by sensible apparitions of Jesus come back to life. It is
easy to see that these apparitions, fitted with time and place and given
material form in the traditional stories, are based upon visions in which faith
was able to find nourishment and confirmation, and for the good reason that
faith had created them. Taken as they stand, the Gospel stories do not show us
the growth of the disciples' emotions into the belief that Jesus was risen from
the dead. It cannot be repeated too often that the object these stories are
aimed at is to transform what was essentially an inward conviction, insight or
vision of faith, into external fact attested by the witness of the senses, and
so make the conviction a part of factual history. To give substance to the
apparitions as external facts, pains were taken to mark the day, with all the
circumstances of their occurrence co-ordinated to those of the death, and with
these again adapted to the day and circumstances of the burial. In this way the
inward visions were objectified into outward occurrences, into material
phenomena at once verifiable and verified. This done, the facts were arranged in
serial order so as to form a posthumous life of Jesus. The faith was thus
defended against objectors by fictions which faith produced for its own
justification, but which were not the source from which it sprang. Belief in the
immortality of Jesus risen from the dead existed long before anybody imagined or
professed to know the day on which he rose, or that his tomb had been found
empty, or that he had afterwards given the disciples their capital instructions,
conversing and eating with them as lie had been accustomed to do before his
death. There is, however, good reason for adding that the authors of our texts
are to be credited with relative sobriety in the shaping of their work. The
tradition they have handed down has deliberately avoided the worst
extravagances,

</p>
<p align="center">96</p>
<p>such as those displayed by the story of the resurrection in
the Gospel of Peter.

</p>
<p>In those who first believed in Jesus the working of faith
was deep and masterful. Their belief that he had risen from the dead was the
fruit of that inner process. Needless to say the process was never analysed by
those in whom it worked. History knows it directly only by its results. We have
seen that the violent death of John the Baptist did not prevent the survival of
his sect and that his followers did not believe that he had perished in the
grave. But fortunes more resounding than John's were in store for Jesus. Let us
not forget how, in the last days, Jesus and his company were convinced that the
Great Event was at hand and that to-morrow might see them enter, alive and
glorified, into the felicity of the Kingdom. There is little risk in assuming
that in these solemn hours the disciples believed that Jesus was about to become
the Messiah promised to Israel and that Jesus himself, in one way or another,
accepted the idea. Nothing is impossible to the ardours of faith. On a faith
which knows not how to criticize itself, and would not if it could, disillusion
has no hold. Then, too, we must remember that, to minds habituated to the belief
in resurrection or in immortality, death is an accident of no significance.
Jesus and his followers were in that condition: they believed that the
resurrection of the just in the Kingdom of God was at hand. One of two things,
then, was inevitable, either the faith of the disciples would founder, which it
neither could nor would; or it would gather up its forces for a bolder
affirmation, continuing to proclaim as before, that the Kingdom was on the point
of coming, but with the addition that Jesus, now raised to glory at God's right
hand, would personally bring it in.

</p>
<p>In fact there was nothing to prevent the disciples from
continuing to expect what they had expected all along. He whom they mourned was
not, in their eyes, a mere teacher who had converted a few simple souls. They
had lost their Master, and their Master was none other than the King of Glory
into whom Jesus was now transfigured and about to reveal himself to the world in
the swiftly coming Kingdom of God. The Kingdom would descend from the high
heavens, whence many besides themselves had begun to look for the coming of the
Messiah, whence they had

</p>
<p align="center">97</p>
<p>always thought he would come, but now expected him with
confidence raised to the highest pitch of certitude. If all the righteous would
be raised from the dead at the coming of the Kingdom, was it not fitting that
Jesus, its prophet and founder, should be raised in advance of the resurrection
of his followers, so soon to come? Since God must needs send him with the
Kingdom would He not at once take him up to His right hand instead of leaving
him in the abodes of the dead? Even if we suppose that Jesus himself had
predicted his death in their presence, he could not have pictured his future
otherwise either to himself or to them. God would not forsake him. The Kingdom
was coming and Jesus, immortal and glorious, would come with the Kingdom.

</p>
<p>What is religious faith? Essentially nothing else than the
whole mind, reason, imagination and will, putting forth their combined energy in
an effort to break a way through the natural framework of existence and escape
from the mechanism which seems so inexorably to govern the destiny of all
things. Thanks to the force of that effort, the difficulties aroused in our
modern minds by the idea of resurrection, difficulties familiar also to the mind
of Greece, had no existence for these Jewish believers, accustomed as they were
to thinking in plain terms of survival after death, and incapable of conceiving
it otherwise. Many apologists in our time have been wont to argue as though the
resurrection of Jesus had to be demonstrated to the disciples by tangible and
indisputable proofs such as would satisfy impartial investigators in a
scientific age. In reality the first believers accepted the resurrection
precisely because they were men for whom proofs of that kind had no interest.
The power of their antecedent faith made it impossible for them to think of
Jesus as one to whom death had put an end; they believed that he had been raised
from death because otherwise they could not think of him as living. The
&quot;how&quot; of the raising troubled them not the least: that was God's
affair. It was only at a later stage, when the Gospel was being proclaimed among
people of non-Jewish mentality that objections began to arise. Then it was that
the effort was made to prove the resurrection by arguments convincing to
critical minds: then it was that material form was given to the fugitive visions
which had been nourishment enough for the earliest faith: then it was that the
story of the tomb found

</p>
<p align="center">98</p>
<p>empty was invented in order to prove that Jesus had not
remained in his grave; then it was that he was represented, in apparitions
clearly characterized, as conversing with his followers, eating with them and
offering to Thomas the wound in his side and the holes in his nail-pierced
hands. This array of proofs, so farfetched and yet naive, was not imagined till
long after the birth of the belief that they were intended to support. The
earliest faith had not sought them; one might almost say it would have found
them meaningless. It never paused to speculate on the where and when of it all;
cared not to know what had happened to the dead body of Jesus; raised no
questions about the reanimation of the corpse and never asked how it had been
done. Had the first believers been men with a turn for scientific inquiry into
these matters they would have had no belief. Those who first came forward as
witnesses that Jesus was risen were indeed persuaded that they had seen him
alive in their visions, but they told no stories of his resurrection as a fact
materially attested.

</p>
<p>Thus did belief in the resurrection of Jesus come to its
birth, and the manner of it may be called spontaneous. The faith of the
disciples in his Messianic future was too strong to admit of self-contradiction,
too strong to give way under the refutation thrown upon it by the ignominy of
the Cross. Faith raised Jesus into the glory he expected; faith declared him
living for ever because faith itself was determined never to die. Quickened by
the ordeal, faith produced out of itself visions that brought balm to its
anguish and strength to its affirmations. With the fragments of a shattered
hope, and building on the death of Jesus, which might well have killed their
faith outright, the disciples founded the religion of Jesus the Christ.
Astonishment that faith can work such a miracle will be felt only by those who
know not what religious faith really is and have no experience of the realities
it can summon into being when once the power of it gets hold on a group of
ardent souls. Unconsciously faith procures for herself all the illusions she
needs for the conservation of her present possessions and for her advance to
further conquests. But, humanly speaking, the work she accomplishes in availing
herself of illusion is not always illusory.

</p>
<p>Attempts at greater precision, if only by conjecture, in
defining the process by which the faith of the disciples took form, are

</p>

<p>apt to end in fantasy. Renan, working on the theme of the
resurrection, made out of it a little romance. J. Weiss, pressing hard on the
meaning of Mark xiv, 28 (&quot;after my rising I will go before you into
Galilee&quot;), concludes that Jesus had promised to lead his disciples after
his resurrection into Galilee where the Kingdom of God would then appear. R. Schütz,
improving on this idea, describes the disciples returning to Galilee with as
much enthusiasm as if Jesus were really with them; Nazareth is saturated with
Hellenism; Jesus himself and his Galilean disciples are full of it; the order of
the day is rejection of the Law (<i>Los von Gesetz</i>); a Hellenist-Christian
community is formed with which a Jewish-Christian community enters into
competition. Thus everything is explained. But the whole construction rests upon
air. [11]

<center><font size=+1>2. THE CONTRIBUTION OF SIMON PETER</font></center>
<p>A name which we shall find in the forefront of the
apostolic propaganda must here be introduced as that of the man who, in all
probability, was the first to give out that Jesus was risen. Simon called Peter
is, according to the tradition, one of the earliest disciples recruited by Jesus
and the head of the apostolic college established by the Christ as the
foundation and guide of the Church. Round him there has grown up an imposing
legend to which his admirers are not the only contributors. None the less his
share in the birth of the Christian movement was assuredly of the highest
importance.

</p>
<p>Legend has made great capital out of the surname Peter
which Jesus himself is said to have conferred on Simon. But legend &quot;would
not be legend if it developed consistently. According to Mark (i, 14-20) Jesus,
at the very beginning of his ministry, peremptorily summons to his side two
brothers, Simon and Andrew, as they were fishing in the sea of Galilee, near to
Capernaum, and immediately afterwards, in the same sovereign manner and under
the same conditions, two more brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee;
this done, he expressly reveals his intention to make the four fishers offish
into fishers of men. To endow the event with greater significance Luke enlarges
the story with that of the miraculous draught of fishes, which the appendix to
John connects with an apparition of the risen

</p>
<p align="center">100</p>
<p>Christ. There can be no doubt that the story of the
Miraculous Draught was originally comprised in the myth which related the
foundation of the Christian apostolate: in the arrangement presented by John,
which is probably the earlier version of the story, the apostolate is a creation
of the immortal Christ. Mark as well as Luke has antedated its institution.
John, in his account of the Vocation (i, 35-42), gives precedence before Peter
to Andrew and to an unnamed but doubtless the &quot;beloved&quot; disciple;
notwithstanding this, the change of name, intended to mark Peter as the
foundation apostle, is made at his first encounter with Jesus — &quot;thou art
Simon son of John; thou shalt be called Cephas&quot; — the evangelist being at
pains to explain that Cephas means Peter. From all of which the historical fact
to be retained is that the Simon in question was among the first adherents of
Jesus, that he lived at Capernaum and was a fisherman by trade.

</p>
<p>In reporting the choice of the Twelve, Mark (iii, 13-19)
puts Peter at the head of the list and adds, as though the surname had been
given on that occasion, &quot;and he gave him the name Peter.&quot; But the
importance of this mystical title is somewhat diminished by the prominence which
the evangelist immediately gives to the resounding surname Boanerges conferred
on the sons of Zebedee in the same circumstances. Luke (vi, 12-16) follows Mark.
Matthew (x, 1-4) in reproducing the apostolic list says simply &quot;first Simon
called Peter&quot; without intimation that the surname was bestowed at the time.
He leaves us to suspect that the surname was not chosen by Jesus. And possibly
not by the Christ. It may have been a mystical development of tradition, and
this is the more likely inasmuch as the incident to which Mark connects it has
no historical consistency.

</p>
<p>In the incident of the Confession at Caesarea Philippi
(&quot;thou art the Christ&quot;) Mark brings Peter to the front, the idea being
that Simon Peter must be the first to proclaim that Jesus is the Messiah on
occasion requiring it. The original intention in recording the confession was,
no doubt, to make it a merit on Peter's part. But the evangelist, as though he
would destroy this favourable impression, forthwith makes Jesus address him as
&quot;Satan&quot; for having tried to prevent the Christ from predicting his
death. &quot;Get thee behind, Satan, thou hast no feeling for the things of
God.&quot; Peter does not understand the necessity and

</p>
<p align="center">101</p>
<p>mystical power of the Passion. Needless to say that if the
Messianic confession has been antedated by the evangelist, this lightning
reproach is still more so. It is a product of the Pauline tradition in its
hostility to the older apostles. Luke omits it — an omission that tells its
own tale. Matthew has retained it, but follows up the Messianic confession by
intercalating a eulogistic response of Jesus in which the confession itself is
presented as a revelation of the Spirit and Simon Peter as the man who would
hold the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, regulate the discipline of the new
community (more or less identified with the Kingdom of Heaven) and would become
the foundation of the Church — the only passage in the Gospels when Jesus
speaks of his Church, and assuredly not the most authentic. [12]

</p>
<p>In all probability this development of the Confession was
originally Jewish-Christian and anti-Pauline, for it was not without purpose
that Peter is said to have been favoured with a revelation from on high in which
flesh and blood had no part. We can almost see in it a discreet response to
certain ambitious claims put out by Paul in Galatians (i, 11-12, 15-16). At all
events there is enough in it to neutralize what is said, a few lines lower down,
about Peter's lack of feeling for things divine. We may add that the bishops of
Rome, who apply the eulogy to their order, have abstained up to now from
claiming the reproach. John is content to idealize the Messianic confession,
turning the profession of faith into a profession of fidelity, and avoiding the
need to add either approbation or corrective (vi, 68-69).

</p>
<p>The transfiguration of Jesus (Mark ix, 2-8) seems to have
been conceived originally as the story of an apparition of the Risen Christ,
afterwards antedated to his earthly life and lodged immediately after the
Confession, with the insertion of a blunder made by Peter, who is judged to have
no understanding of the manifestation, Mark and Luke excusing him as not knowing
what he said. We have already seen that the Apocalypse of Peter connects the
blunder with the rebuff administered by Jesus, which Mark has placed after the
Confession and the first announcement of the passion. It is the same Peter who
figures at Gethsemane in an attitude little to his glory, sleeping, spite of his
Master's warning, while Jesus is at prayer in the Agony. All the evangelists,
moreover, describe, with a kind of complacency,

</p>
<p align="center">102</p>
<p>Peter's triple denial in the High Priest's house during the
trial of Jesus, and all are careful to make Jesus predict the denial before the
event: in this way the offence is, as it were, palliated and then corrected by
the repentance of the culprit. It is to be noted that Mark (xiv, 50) begins by
saying that all the disciples took to flight, after which one hardly expects to
find Peter following Jesus even &quot;afar off&quot; (54) as the armed band led
him away. The same incoherence in Matthew. Luke omits the flight but records the
denial. In John xviii, 15-18, 25-27, the denial, cut in two, seems to have begun
in the house of Annas and ended in the house of Caiaphas, without Peter changing
his place. On this anomaly see Le quatrieme Evangile, 458-460; 463-464.

</p>
<p>Exegetes have made it a merit in Peter that he himself
revealed his weakness, which the world would never have known if he had held his
tongue. There are better grounds for believing that the incident is in line with
the other fictions invented to belittle an apostle who became the grand
authority of Jewish Christianity.

</p>
<p>Amends of a kind are made to Peter in the stories of the
resurrection. The angel names him to the women for a special injunction to
return to Galilee, where, it would seem, the coming manifestation of the Risen
Christ is to concern him more than the other disciples (Mark xvi, 7). In Matthew
there is no mention of Peter. [13] Luke changes the whole character of the
angel's discourse to the women, but represents Jesus as predicting to Peter,
during the Last Supper, that his faith would be unshakable in the coming torment
and that his part would be to strengthen the shaken faith of his brethren. This
prediction seems to have been conceived at an independent source which, if not
ignorant of the story of the denial, left it aside. As Luke knew of Peter's
vision (xxiv, 34) but abstains from giving an account of it, he must have known
also that it was this vision that enabled Peter to revive the faith of the other
disciples; and of that, too, he says nothing. In the Fourth Gospel the coming
martyrdom of Peter is announced twice over (xiii, 36 and xxi, 18-19) and the
Risen Christ, after the apparition on the Lake, where Peter is the leading
figure, solemnly confides to him the guardianship of his flock. [14] From all of
which it is clear enough that the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles have done
their best to

</p>
<p align="center">103</p>
<p>reconcile two divergent tendencies: one, Jewish-Christian,
in which the role of Peter was magnified; the other characteristic of certain
Pauline circles, in which it was belittled: the reconciliation being effected,
more or less happily, by upholding Peter as the head of the apostolate not only
to the Jews, to which the Epistle to the Galatians (ii, 7-9) would limit him,
but also to the world at large. The editor of Acts exhibits him in this
universal character even at the risk of making him profess the doctrine of
salvation by faith alone before the elders of Jerusalem after the affair of
Cornelius, which symbolizes the opening of salvation to the whole world, with
Peter as the opener of the door. The reality of Peter's contribution was of
dimensions much more modest than this, but it led to results no less important.

</p>
<p>Putting all these indications together we may conclude that
Simon Peter was a fisherman, perhaps a master-fisherman of Capernaum, that he
was an early adherent of Jesus, whom he accompanied in his wanderings and then
followed to Jerusalem. If Jesus in his lifetime was not hailed by him as the
Christ at Caesarea Philippi, Peter certainly entered with his whole being into
the Great Expectation, and came to Jerusalem to share in the coming of God and
the revelation of Messiah in that city. His faith survived the catastrophe.
Returning to Galilee, to the surroundings and atmosphere whence the Great
Expectation had its birth, coming back also to himself, his thought leapt to the
conviction that Jesus could not have perished in death and that God had taken
him to Himself that He might reveal him to the world in the day of his coming,
straightway believing that he could see the Master thus, immortal with God. Such
is the meaning of the firm tradition that the first vision of Jesus had come, in
Galilee, to Simon Peter. No account of that first vision is to be found in any
of the documents. Mark gives an advance hint of it (xvi, 7; cf. i Cor. xv, 5).
Luke is content to mention the bare fact (xxiv, 34). The appendix to John (xxi)
attaches it to a miraculous draught of fishes, where it is difficult to
recognize, except in the symbolic meaning of the prodigy. But it may be said
with confidence that the primacy of Peter's vision is implied by the whole
tradition relating to apparitions of the Christ.

</p>
<p>It may well be that Peter himself never described his
vision, just as Paul never described the vision which converted him, for

</p>
<p align="center">104</p>
<p>the triple story of the vision in Acts cannot be considered
as coming directly or indirectly from Paul himself. Whatever the content of the
vision may have been, its occurrence was a sudden explosion produced by the
intense and inward workings of faith; out of which there leaped forth the answer
to the riddle of the crucifixion. The answer was this — death has not held
Jesus captive: he is alive with God, on the point of returning as the Christ
with the Kingdom. What Peter was able to see in his vision escapes us and would
seem to us insignificant if we knew it; what matters far more are the deductions
that were made from it. The idea of a blessed survival was certainly not strange
to Peter. His mind kept turning it over, and turning it over with Jesus as the
focus of his thought. Then came the shining day when he thought that Jesus was
visibly, and perhaps audibly, before him. His faith filled the vision with all
he longed to believe and gave him the assurance that what he saw was a reality. 

</p>
<p>Neither historian nor psychologist need inquire further.
Even if we had before us a detailed account from Peter himself of what he
believed to be a vision of Jesus clothed with immortality we should hardly know
more, nor better understand the certitude of his faith.

</p>
<p>We may be equally sure that Peter's faith immediately
became contagious among those about him, the former disciples of Jesus, who,
like Peter, were already prepared for it, one might even say were being carried
along by it. He &quot;strengthened the brethren&quot;; that is, he regathered
the now scattered group who had staked their hope on Jesus the Nazorean, and
imparted to them his own confidence. Removed to the invisible world, the object
of their faith was beyond the reach of the accidents which might otherwise have
shaken belief. True, the Kingdom of God was in no haste to come; true, the
Messiah delayed his appearance among the clouds. But what of that? One can
always wait a little longer. They waited.

</p>
<p>What length of time was needed to bring about this
rekindling of their faith? We can only conjecture. But since a faith which
hesitates or remains dormant for long is unlikely ever to revive, we are
entitled to think that the interval was fairly short and the tempo rapid. We may
assume that Peter had his vision in the days immediately following his return to
Capernaum, days filled

</p>
<p align="center">105</p>
<p>with the thought of his lost Master. Arrived at a clear
conviction, he at once imparted it to his companions, and immediately these
humble folk were back on the summit of the idealism to which Jesus had led them.
More than that, they were persuaded that the Master was still alive and beyond a
doubt was about to &quot;come&quot; again, but this time with the
&quot;Kingdom&quot; and in &quot;the glory of the Father.&quot; Back, then, to
Jerusalem, appointed scene of the Great Event, there to wait for his coming!
Only a naive and superficial psychology would interpret this bright dawning of
the faith as the product of material proof, such as the empty tomb, or of a
parcel of gross illusions, and spend effort in searching for these proofs while
knowing them to be false when found. Not through preoccupation with such proofs
were the disciples possessed with their ardent belief that Jesus was alive with
the Father. They believed it ardently because they desired it ardently and felt
him near to them in the ardour of their desire, while fugitive and dreamlike
visions, perhaps pure dreams, sufficed for the time to nourish and confirm their
faith. Then came the discovery of confirmation in the Scriptures. Only at a
still later period, when discussion had arisen, did the search begin for more
palpable arguments; but it was not until the second, or possibly the third,
Christian generation that the need for such arguments became urgent. This was
the stage at which the story of the empty tomb was invented, but too
reflectively for our liking; and then it was that the fugitive visions of the
Risen One, the memory of which had sustained the faith of the first age, were
transformed into apparitions and presented as tangible realities.

</p>
<p>We have endeavoured to reconstitute the faith of Peter on
lines which follow as closely as possible the faith which Jesus had, the faith
which had led him to Jerusalem. In this we have been on fairly safe ground. The
prompt return of these first believers to the capital of Judaism and their
continued residence there have to be explained, and what other explanation can
be given? The members of the pious band had no intention to make Jerusalem the
centre of an apostolic mission to distant lands; it may be doubted if they had
any conception of apostleship in the strict sense of the term. They came back to
Jerusalem to await the Christ, and remained there for that purpose as long as
they

</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;106</p>
<p>could. The last believers of this type quitted the Holy
City when Roman armies were about to invest it, having doubtless come to the
conclusion that Jerusalem, deaf to their warning, must be destroyed and trodden
down of the Gentiles before the new and eternal Jerusalem, the true City of God,
could be established in its place.

</p>
<p>It was the march of events that first brought the apostolic
office into existence and then gave direction to its work. But before we
reconstitute the evolution of that office, at least hypothetically, it behoves
us to weigh the importance of the forward step the disciples had now taken in
raising their dead master, Jesus, to the dignity of Christ alive in heaven.
Without a suspicion on their part of what was involved, their belief was already
an essential transformation of the Gospel announced by Jesus; but nothing could
be less intended by it than to form the followers of the Christ they were
proclaiming into a particular sect either at the centre or the circumference of
Judaism. Right up to the moment of Golgotha inclusive, Jesus and his companions
seemed in their own eyes to be standing on the ground of a hope common to all
the Jews. As to the complicity of the Jewish leaders in the sentence of death
pronounced by Pilate, if complicity there were, it could be passed over as a
human error and an injustice to God's Ambassador. The preaching of Jesus may
well have prepared the way for a split in Judaism, but had not yet created it.
But the split was bound to occur if the partisans of the crucified prophet took
the line of openly proclaiming that he, their Master, now raised to life at the
right hand of God, was the Christ, and that his coming was at hand. Such a
profession of faith could not be a matter of indifference to the religious
authorities of Judaism nor to the Jewish mass which obeyed them. The vast
majority of the Jews would have refused at once to recognize the Christ in the
man crucified on Calvary; he would seem to them in nowise qualified for such an
honour, and the hope that, after such a prelude, he would presently descend on
the clouds of heaven to judge the earth, would be counted a chimerical
absurdity. True, a Christ in heaven was less of a political danger than a
messianic agitator on earth but, apart from that, many would regard the
partisans of the Christ as merely troublesome fanatics, while the majority, from
the religious

</p>
<p align="center">107</p>
<p>leaders downwards, would proclaim them heretics, and as
such drive out of the fold whoever would persevere in such a faith. Thus
condemned and driven out these obstinate believers would, without any will of
their own, become a sect more or less under suspicion or even shameful and
despised. That point reached, the road which led from the new Gospel to a
Christian religion separate from Judaism would be opened to traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<center><font size=+1>3. PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST
BELIEVERS</font></center></p>
<p>So Peter and his companions, brimful of their hopes, went
back to Jerusalem. Whether the Feast of Pentecost had anything to do with their
return to the city they had recently quitted in their extremity cannot be stated
with confidence. Certainly it was not only as a pilgrimage that the return
journey was undertaken. They went back with the intention of remaining in the
Holy City and, so to say, of making a home there. Formed plan of active
propaganda they clearly had not; perhaps it was not within their means; moreover
the indications are that they were somewhat cautious at the beginning in
communicating their faith. We may suppose they found lodgings with friendly
people, perhaps with those who had entertained them when they came up with Jesus
for the Passover. Living on little, they kept up assiduous attendance in the
Temple at the hours of prayer. Without any attempt at public preaching in that
neighbourhood they found opportunities to impart their hope to a few of the
pious Jews whom they met in the outer court. The grand scenes of preaching
described in Acts (ii, iii, iv, v) have no more reality than the sittings of the
Sanhedrim convened to put a stop to the apostolic propaganda (iv, v). The
conviction that had kindled the ardour of John the Baptist and of Jesus in their
ministries was at work to the same effect in them, and long continued to work as
the driving power of the Christian apostolate. The Kingdom being at hand,
nothing could be more urgent than to warn men of goodwill, wherever they could
be met, to make ready for the Great Event. And, like John in his day, and Jesus
in his, they met from time to time with simple souls who believed their message
and joined their little company.

</p>
<p>It is also probable that Baptism was administered to their 

</p>
<p align="center">108</p>
<p>proselytes in association with their profession of faith in
Jesus the Messiah. For the Christian religion made its entry into the •world
as a baptist movement, and must have so begun since Jesus himself had turned it
in that direction. It would be hard to understand why Peter and his companions
decided to baptize the newcomers unless the rite had seemed a matter of course
as conforming to the practice of Jesus. In like manner it was customary for the
new initiates to share in the simple meals of the brethren, when the bread was
broken in memory of Jesus and in lively expectation of his coming. [15]

</p>
<p>If we are to believe the book of Acts, which at this point
seems to reflect an authentic tradition of the earliest community, it was a
miraculous incident which first drew the attention of the temple priests to the
followers of the new faith. This was the cure of a paralytic operated by Peter
in the name of Jesus the Nazorean. [16] After making whatever reserves may be
needed in regard to the supernatural character of this adventure, only a paltry
rationalism would deny the probability that Peter made the attempt and even
succeeded, or that Jesus ever risked it and with like success. We may be sure
that the Christian missionaries would not hesitate to practice exorcisms for the
cure of maladies by invoking the name of Jesus. Somebody must have made a
beginning: it was Peter who made it on the day in question. On seeing the
paralytic walk, a crowd formed, a great uproar rose round Peter and the
miraculous walker; the temple police naturally came on the scene and the
priests, informed of what had happened, asked Peter &quot;by what power or in
what name&quot; he had done that. To their utter amazement they learnt that the
potent name was &quot;Jesus-Messiah the Nazorean&quot; and that the men before
them were followers of the Galilean recently crucified at the Passover.
Whereupon &quot;they strictly commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in
the name of Jesus.&quot; And &quot;when they had further threatened them, they
let them go, finding nothing that they might punish them, because of the people;
for all men glorified God for that which was done. For the man was over forty
years old on whom this miracle was shewed&quot; (Acts iv, 2I-22). [17]

</p>
<p>Prodigies of this kind increase the vogue of a nascent
religion. One was enough to raise the credit of our pious band in the eyes of
the common people. If the editor of Acts has not multiplied

</p>
<p align="center">109</p>
<p>the number of them — as when he makes the shadow of Peter
heal the sick brought in from neighbouring towns to attend his walk (v, 15-16)
— we may be sure that public rumour did. As people watched the band at prayer
or conversing with adherents under the Porch of Solomon, the most part would
keep at a distance knowing that the priests now regarded their doings with no
friendly eye. That, however, did not prevent increasing recruitment by private
propaganda (v, 52). But the anger of the authorities would certainly be roused
by any rash attempt at public preaching; nothing more was needed to bring down
the arm of the law.

</p>
<p>There is evidence that cohesion was rapidly acquired by
this ardent group. Tradition has it that their meals were taken in common and
that each contributed of his substance for the support of the fraternity. That
this was the practice of these latter day saints may well be true. The Christ
might come at any hour, and what else remained to do but help one another in the
brief interval before his coming, the better-off ministering to the wants of the
poor and bringing provisions to the common table. &quot;There was not among them
one person in want,&quot; remarks the editor of Acts, no doubt with a touch of
exaggeration. It is true, nevertheless, that the Jerusalem community was always
poor. But this was not, as many have thought, the result of a communistic system
established at the outset; such a system certainly never existed in the rigorous
form suggested by a literal reading of Acts. The poverty of the group was due to
the fact that the nucleus of Galilean believers found themselves in Jerusalem
almost without resources; that the new members seldom came from the richer
classes of the city's population; that the generosity of the few better-off was
insufficient to overcome the general indigence; that indigence was not
unwelcome, since the Kingdom was for the poor; that, in their preoccupation with
the coming parousia, they had little concern for the business of this world,
fell into poverty and remained poor as the inevitable consequences of neglecting
it. It does not follow that any of them died of hunger. The condition in which
they were is supportable enough when religious faith is intense and the needs of
the body restricted to the bare minimum. [18]

</p>
<p>Precarious and rudimentary as the organization was, it was 

</p>
<p align="center">110</p>
<p>yet organization. This society of friends had leaders, and
we know who they were. They were the Twelve, whom tradition has made into
apostles, and even into apostles par excellence. though some of them were not
very active as missionaries of the new faith. Strictly speaking, the Twelve were
the administrators of the first community, this is implied in Acts iv, 34 and v,
11, whatever doubts may be felt about the passage as a whole and the adventure
of Ananias and Sapphira. But the Twelve certainly had no existence as a separate
group prior to the formation of the community from which they were chosen. The
committee of the Twelve — if that were the real number, as it probably was —
was created in order to give the little society the elementary organization that
would be needful in the early stages of its growth. The number of these
committee-men, assuming it to have been twelve, seems to betray a symbolic
intention; it corresponded to the arrangement imagined for the Kingdom of God in
which the hopes of Israel were to be fulfilled. The saying about the twelve
thrones, to be occupied by the twelve apostles judging the twelve tribes bears
witness to the ruling idea (Matthew xix, 28). But the function there assigned to
the Twelve is one of government rather than of preaching. Quite naturally our
twelve overseers would be chosen from among the original disciples of Jesus in
Galilee, with Peter as some sort of President. But it cannot be said that
&quot;apostle&quot; was their title from the very first.

</p>
<p>Certain ecclesiastical writers long since pointed out [19]
that the name &quot;apostle&quot; belonged to the emissaries maintained after
the fall of Jerusalem by the Jewish patriarchate to carry the letters of the
central authority and to collect the subscriptions paid by the Jews of the
Dispersion. On the strength of this it was supposed by Harnack and many others
that the function must have existed before Jerusalem fell, and that the name
passed to the Christian preachers who also organized collections in the
communities, as appears from the testimony and example of Paul. But, if these
envoys existed before the year 70, which is possible, it is difficult to
understand how their name could have been applied to the messengers of the
Gospel who were not sent out to visit already established communities, nor were
chiefly collectors of offerings; while, as we have just seen, the Twelve, who
seem to have been

</p>
<p align="center">111</p>
<p>the first to hold the apostolic office, were not sent out
anywhere and were neither professional preachers nor collectors of alms in the
strict meaning of the term. Moreover the evidence of the New Testament on the
matter is confused enough to make the problem difficult of solution, apart from
any question that may be raised about a connexion between the Christian
apostolate and the office of the Jewish collectors.

</p>
<p>A close examination of the Book of Acts shows clearly that
it knows of no apostles save the Twelve, understanding their title of apostle as
meaning that they were missionaries of the Word and qualified for the work,
inasmuch as they had been witnesses of the resurrection and followers of Jesus
from the beginning of his ministry to the final hour of his ascent into heaven.
Though the definition is systematic, and as such not without interest, we are
not entitled to transport it into history. But Paul's Epistles reveal a much
wider application of the term which bestowed it on Christian missionaries in
general, and first of all on Paul who, while seeming to give express recognition
to the apostleship of the Twelve, claimed the title for himself also, a claim
which the Twelve and their party appear to have contested. The Epistles mention
&quot;the Twelve&quot; only once (i Cor. xv, 5). Luke affirms that Jesus himself
named the disciples &quot;apostles&quot; (vi, 18), and throughout his Gospel, as
in Acts, the Twelve and the apostles are the same persons, while Mark, who makes
Jesus not only choose them but &quot;send them out&quot; as well, only once
calls them &quot;apostles&quot; (vi, 30) and speaks constantly of &quot;the
Twelve.&quot; Matthew in like manner has &quot;the twelve apostles&quot; once
only (x, 2), but often &quot;the twelve disciples&quot; or &quot;the
twelve.&quot; In the fourth Gospel &quot;the twelve&quot; are mentioned twice,
but not called apostles (vi, 67, 71; xx, 24).

</p>
<p>From all this confusion the certainty seems to emerge that
the Twelve were not called apostles at the time they were formed into a group,
nor did they become apostles merely by their membership. They were elected from
among &quot;the disciples,&quot; that is, the existing body of believers, not to
preach, but to order the affairs of the first community, so far as this was
necessary. Their importance grew as the Gospel spread. Viewing the matter from a
standpoint in the present and giving full confidence to the Pauline literature,
we might be tempted to conclude, as

</p>
<p align="center">112</p>
<p>Edouard Meyer has done, that the attribution of the title
to the Twelve only was a reaction against the claim of Paul to be an independent
apostle and missionary to the Gentiles, appointed thereto directly by the Lord
— a reaction which went so far as to exclude Paul from any right to the title.
This would explain why, in Mark, instructions intended for all the Christian
missionaries are addressed to the Twelve in particular, [20] a transference the
more easily made since Peter himself turned missionary after the year 44,
together with his colleagues in Jerusalem and the brothers of the Lord (i Cor.
ix, 5).

</p>
<p>It may well be that the transference of the title to the
Twelve was not made quite so simply, promptly and mechanically. When indications
furnished by our sources, themselves of later origin, are interpreted as
reflecting the first beginnings of the Christian movement, we run the risk of
immensely shortening a development which took a much longer time to mature. It
is obvious that no missionaries (apostles) can have been appointed until
missions had begun, and we can see both how and why the Twelve were not
instituted as apostles; for not only is it true that not all of them were
missionaries at any time, but those who were missionaries, that is employed in
the propagation of the Gospel, were not missioned (if the word may be used) from
any source outside or above; properly speaking, no mission had been given them
as apostles in the service, to which they were devoting themselves, of
propagating the Gospel. The apostolate in the sense indicated by our texts, does
not begin until the business of propaganda has an organized basis, at least of a
rudimentary kind; and this, it seems, did not happen until after the dispersion
of the group of hellenizing believers which we are about to consider in the next
chapter. When that has happened then, to Judge by what we shall see taking place
at Antioch, the apostles are definitely missioned, delegated and approved by a
group which supported them. In this way, as we shall see, Paul and Barnabas were
at first appointed to the propaganda in Syria and Cilicia.

</p>
<p>At that time Paul had not put forth his claim to a unique
and special mission conferred upon him by the Christ alone. In the epistles he
would seem to have first made this claim when he decided to go his own way. As
one no longer missioned by a

</p>
<p align="center">113</p>
<p>group he would despise henceforth the attribution of a
human commission, and proclaims himself missioned by the Christ. Meanwhile the
number of missionaries was rapidly increasing both in Palestine and beyond, but
always it would seem in the same conditions under which Paul and Barnabas had
been missioned at Antioch, Paul remaining alone in the singularity of his claim.
It must be added, however, that this claim, clothed in the absolute form given
it by various passages in the epistles, does not correspond with the reality of
the situation and must have been conceived after the event. It belongs to the
development of the literature called apostolic. The same is true of the
systematic limitation of the apostolic title to the Twelve said by the
evangelists to have been missioned by Jesus in the course of his ministry. This
last point, which reveals the opposition to the Pauline tradition, was reached
only when the conditions of Christian propaganda had completely changed and the
primitive apostolate had become hardly more than a memory preserved in legend
and surrounded by a halo. But let us now turn to the event immediately followed
by the apostolic propaganda, of which it seems to have released the spring.&nbsp;

</p>
<p><center><font size=+1>4. STEPHEN AND THE HELLENISTS</font></center></p>
<p>From a story in Acts (vi, 1-6) superficially clear, but
intentionally confused, the fact emerges that the group of Jerusalem believers,
whose recruits, after its first formation, had not been all of one type, was
quickly divided into two parties. It soon counted among its members a certain
number of hellenizing Jews, that is, Jews whose ordinary language was Greek, and
whose ways of thinking, perhaps also their manner of life, were not quite the
same as those of the believers speaking Aramaic and called &quot;Hebrews,&quot;
who had been gained over in the beginning by the disciples from Galilee. The
hellenizing believers presently began to hold separate meetings with an
organization of their own. What Acts tells us about the choice of the seven
deacons is a fiction which too thinly disguises the distinct organization set up
by these messianic Jews whom we must suppose to have been better acquainted with
the pagan world than were the believers from Palestine. The greater part of them
had probably lived more or

</p>
<p align="center">114</p>
<p>less in Greek or in hellenized countries and had come to
Jerusalem either on temporary business or with the intention of establishing a
permanent abode. It must not be forgotten that the regular relations established
between Jerusalem and the communities of the Jewish Dispersion, which
facilitated travel from place to place, helped greatly at the outset in
spreading the Christian propaganda.

</p>
<p>Even on the strength of the fiction arranged by the editor
of Acts, one is driven to suppose that the community of Jerusalem believers
found itself, after no long time, composed of two elements which were not slow
to separate more or less completely. In addition to that, since it was the
hellenizing group only which, compromised by the action of one of its members,
was driven out and dispersed, we may take it as certain that these hellenizers
already constituted a distinct body having its own directors, the seven
so-called deacons, and that the propagation of the Christian religion beyond
Judea was begun by the scattered members of that group. The great outburst of
evangelical preaching outside Palestine, to say nothing of that already inside,
did not come from the Twelve and their group of Hebraizers. This fact the editor
of Acts takes pains to hide, but without succeeding; and here is the point of
departure to which he co-ordinates many other fictions in the course of the
book. (Later on a bolder step was taken by representing the twelve apostles as
having left Jerusalem after dividing between them the world to be converted.) In
order to preserve the union of the Hebrew and Hellenizing groups in a single
community, as his perspective required, the editor makes out that the Twelve
constituted a kind of priestly body which administered the spiritual affairs of
the community, and changes the seven heads of the hellenizing party to the lower
status of deacons or helpers to the Twelve, appointed for the service of tables
and the distribution of alms, in other words, for the administration of the
temporalities — a type of organization which was in fact adopted in the
Christian community, but only at a later stage.

</p>
<p>The list of the seven deacons is neither better nor worse
guaranteed than that of the twelve apostles. But the Seven were not helpers
subordinate to the Twelve. They were formed as the governing body of the
hellenizing group as soon as it acquired a separate existence. The existence of
the group is certain. How

</p>
<p align="center">115</p>
<p>exactly it was formed escapes us. Some difference of
opinion analogous to that mentioned in Acts may have given occasion for the
split; but the cause was other and profound. And we cannot invert the
chronological relation of the two groups, as if faith in Jesus had begun with
the hellenizing party. All the names on the list of deacons are Greek. Only one
of the seven is a paean by origin, but circumcised; he comes from Antioch; the
others are Jews by birth but not &quot;Hebrews&quot; by language. It should be
noted that the number seven, like the number twelve, has a symbolic meaning,
being the cypher for the gentile or universal world, as twelve is for Israel.
For that reason a strict interpretation of the names on the list would be out of
place.

</p>
<p>One individual alone stands out before us detached from the
hellenistic group as having taken the initiative in the public propagation of
the Gospel message in Jerusalem, and with results of considerable importance.
Stephen, whom Acts describes as &quot;full of grace and power&quot; —
animated, that is, by a zeal outstandingly effective in preaching — seems to
have been the first to carry the Gospel into the arena of public discussion, not
in the Temple, but in certain synagogues of the Greek-speaking Jews in
Jerusalem. According to the statement in Acts, which seems to have been tampered
with, &quot;there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue
of the Libertines, and Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and
Asia, who disputed with Stephen, and they were not able to resist the wisdom and
the Spirit by which he spake&quot; (vi, 9). The text insists on the opposition
to Stephen's discourse, but tells us nothing of what the preacher said to
provoke it. The source-document on which the editor was working no doubt
indicated this in place of the miracles attributed to Stephen in v, 8. But
having just placed Stephen among the deacons, he would naturally be unwilling to
exhibit him too plainly in the preaching function of an apostle. 

</p>
<p>The reference to synagogues is probably to several where
Stephen found opportunity for delivering his message to the congregations
gathered there. It is in keeping with the sense of the above passage to assume
that the disputes in question were not confined to private conversations, and
that Stephen took his turn to address the congregations, as any private person,
even one not recognized to be a qualified preacher, could do. That his teaching
raised

</p>
<p align="center">116</p>
<p>objections should cause no surprise; and it is not
impossible that the ardour of his convictions reduced his adversaries to
silence. The certain fact is that instant animosity was aroused against Stephen
by these actions.

</p>
<p>Let us recall at this point how the cautious propaganda of
the Galilean disciples came into being and was allowed to continue, even for
several years after the affair of Stephen, without serious interference from the
authorities. If Stephen's efforts to win converts were quickly followed by
forcible official reaction the reason must be sought in its publicity, and, very
probably, in the character of his teaching. This, at certain points, differed
from the teaching of the original disciples. They announced that Jesus was risen
from the dead as the Christ and about to return with the reign of God; but they
did not speculate on the economy of the coming kingdom, nor on the changes it
might involve in matters concerning the established cult of Judaism. Stephen, it
seems, was less reserved. The witnesses who appeared against him at his trial
before the Sanhedrim are reported to have said:

</p>
<p>&quot;This man is for ever speaking against the holy place
and the Law: for we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazorean will destroy
this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.&quot; [21]
Although the deponents are described as &quot;false witnesses&quot; the charge
is not said to have been denied, but was rather confirmed by Stephen who, in an
ecstatic outburst and with transfigured countenance, answered the question of
the high priest by simply exclaiming: &quot;I see the heavens opened and the Son
of Man standing at the right hand of God.&quot; Without taking these indications
for an official report of a judicial inquiry, which they are not, we are
entitled to infer from them that this hellenizing Jew went to the length of
saying that the temple, the bloody sacrifices, the legal observances and
whatever was specifically Jewish in the established cult would pass away at the
of the Christ. Such, we are given to suppose, was Stephen's comment on the
saying attributed to Jesus concerning the temple which he would destroy and
rebuild. [22]

</p>
<p>As already pointed out, closely analogous doctrines or
opinions are to be met with in certain of the baptist sects and to some extent
among the Essenes. Their converts from paganism were dispensed from an array of
prescriptions which, said they, were

</p>
<p align="center">117</p>
<p>due to be abrogated under the coming Reign of God and the
imposition of which was found a serious obstacle to the propagation of the
faith. In the sequel, the destruction of the Temple in the year 70 was soon to
give these practices and doctrines a measure of justification. Was it not clear
that God, by that event, had condemned the outward and material economy of the
Jewish cult?

</p>
<p>In that lies the starting point for explaining the conduct
of the missionaries who went out from Antioch, the work of Paul, and even the
foundation of hellenistic Christianity. The long and curious indictment of the
Jews attributed to Stephen (vii, 2-33) is conceived in the same anti-Jewish
spirit. It is a digression, serving the dominant purpose of the editor of Acts,
which is to prove that notwithstanding the recriminations and fury of those who
are Jews by race and name, it is not these always hardened and rebellious Jews
but the Christians who represent the religion which claims the authority of
Abraham, Moses and the prophets. The author had an ampler experience than
Stephen could have had towards the year 30 of our era.

</p>
<p>The exact date of his martyrdom, just indicated
approximately, is uncertain. Unless we abandon all the indications of time in
Acts and Galatians, we are led to place the martyrdom of the sons of Zebedee in
the year 44; a little earlier than that, the meeting in Jerusalem at which the
question of legal observances was discussed; and the conversion of Paul about
the year 30. With these data as our baseline we must place the crucifixion of
Jesus in 26 or 27 and the martyrdom of Stephen in 28 or 29. This leaves the
sequence of events somewhat compressed, for it is obvious that the Christian
propaganda had reached Damascus and made some progress there before the
conversion of Paul. It is true that the faith was rapidly contagious;
nevertheless a minimum of time was needed for its formation and diffusion.

</p>
<p>Here then is Stephen, the first martyr of the Christ and in
some sense his first apostle, condemned to death, apparently after regular trial
in the courts for blasphemy against the Law. He died by stoning in pursuance of
the sentence pronounced by a Jewish tribunal^. Until quite recent years it has
been taken for granted that the Sanhedrim had no power to pronounce a capital
sentence ^d least of all to carry it into execution without ratification by

</p>
<p align="center">118</p>
<p>the Roman procurator, and, since there is no mention of
Pontius Pilate or of his successor, it is supposed that Stephen's execution was
an affair of mob-law and carried out in a riot, as the conclusion of the story
gives us to understand. To this it is often added that the execution probably
took place in 36 during the interval between the departure of Pilate and the
arrival of his successor, as if, on anything of the kind happening, there was no
representative of Roman authority in the city to give ratification. It seems
certain on the contrary that the Sanhedrim retained complete jurisdiction in all
religious matters and that its competence was limited on the political side
only. The false perspective in which the Evangelists have set the trial of Jesus
has contributed more than anything else to lead criticism astray at this point.
It was only after the destruction of Jerusalem that the religious authorities of
Judaism were deprived of the right to pass sentence of death, by losing the
National Council which possessed the right.

</p>
<p>Repression of the new movement was not limited to the
execution of Stephen. Menaced and hunted down, the whole group to which he
belonged scattered and lost no time in clearing out of Jerusalem. Whatever the
editor of Acts, who contradicts himself, may say, it was not the entire
community, Hebrew and Greek believers alike &quot;except the apostles&quot;
(viii, 1), that was persecuted and driven into flight. (If they were bent on
exterminating the Hebrew group why did they spare its chiefs?) It was the
hellenistic group only. The Hebrew group was not disturbed, no doubt because it
was less disturbing.

</p>
<p>The story in Acts of repressive proceedings against both
groups hangs together with the equally fictitious particulars about Saul-Paul
taking part in the affair. The elements of the latter fiction are adjusted to
the course of the story. By way of introducing him it opens by saying that the
witnesses, who had to cast the first stones, &quot;laid down their garments at
the feet of a youth named Saul&quot; who was &quot;consenting to the
execution.&quot; [23] 

</p>
<p>A few lines further on the youth finds himself promoted,
somewhat rapidly in view of his age, to the office of Grand Persecutor of
Christianity in Jerusalem: it would seem, moreover, that he went about it by
himself, proceeding on his own authority to search all the houses of the city in
his hunt for Christians, and to 

</p>
<p align="center">119</p>
<p>take men and women to prison; while next day a commission
from the High Priest charges him to continue the business at Damascus; though it
is not easy to see how the Gospel could have so soon found its way into that
city.

</p>
<p>Later we shall discuss the legend of Paul's conversion. The
preliminaries found in the story of Stephen's martyrdom are totally unworthy of
credence. The &quot;youth,&quot; even if we suppose him to have aged ten years
as he went home after the execution of Stephen, could not have organized and
carried on all alone the persecution of the Christians here ascribed to him.
According to Galatians (i, 22-24) the Christian communities in Judea, prior to
the Jerusalem conference, knew Paul only by reputation. Paul was not in
Jerusalem when Stephen was executed. As general persecutor of the nascent
Christian religion he is a creation of legend. The motive of the editor of Acts
in calling him &quot;a youth&quot; is to present him as having been brought up
at Jerusalem and a pupil of the famous Gamaliel (xxii, 3; v, 34). The editor has
also made Gamaliel his victim by putting a discourse in his mouth, which the
good doctor never made, on the occasion of a trial of the Twelve, which never
took place. What we are told of the relations of Paul with Gamaliel has every
likelihood of being no less fictitious than the rest.

</p>
<p>From the time of the persecution onwards we find the entire
community of Judaizing believers established in Jerusalem, just as it was
before. There Peter and his companions remained, without any one of them being
molested, till towards the end of the reign of Agrippa I. But never again was a
Hellenizing group, such as Stephen's had been, formed in that city. Obviously
Jerusalem was unpromising ground for the open propaganda of their Messiah —
Jesus, especially if it was thought to offer any kind of threat to Jewish
nationalism and the superstitious regard for the Law. But those who had driven
the group of Stephen into flight turned out to have assured, by that very act,
the future of the Christian religion.</p>
