<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER I</h2></center>
<P>
[1] R. Eisler's defence of the partial authenticity of supplements contained 
in the Slavic version of <i>The Jewish War</i> is distinguished by great learning 
and subtlety. A criticism of the thesis may be found, by M. Goguel, in 
<i>Revue d'histoire et de philosophic religieuses</i>, March-April 1930, pp. 177—190.
<P>
[2] ii, 1—16: Paul's self-defence against other missionaries, ending in a 
violent outburst against Jewish persecutors, in the spirit and style of Acts;
iii, 2b-4, interpolation of the same character, presupposing a long experience 
of persecution (iii, 2a should be attached to 5: "we have sent Timothy, our 
brother and servant of God in the Gospel of the Christ, to know how you 
stand in the faith," etc.).
<P>
[3] A fragment with a style all its own, making a violent breach in the 
moral precepts at the end of the Epistle. The apocalyptic description, which 
is a deliberate paraphrase of Gospel texts, stamps itself as later than the 
apostolic age (cf. iv, 15 and Mark ix, 1, xiii, 30; also v, 1-2 with Mark xiii, 
31; Matthew xxiv, 43; Luke xii, 39).
<P>
[4] The end of verse 3 seems to have been added to give the Epistle the 
character of instruction addressed to the universal Church. The words 
"and I am of Christ," in verse 12, are probably interpolated.
<P>
[5] i, 17-ii, 8. "The princes of this world," in ii, 8, are not political rulers 
of human appointment, of whom there would be no need to inform us that 
they are not in God's confidence. Jesus is here called "the Lord of glory," 
in allusion to Psalm xxiv, 7-9. The quotation in verse 9 probably comes 
from some Apocrypha and must be a gloss.
<P>
[6] Observe that, in vii, 10, the author appeals to the Gospel prohibition of 
divorce (cf. Mark x, 9), and then, in verse 12, takes it on himself to authorize 
the divorce of the Christian partners in a mixed marriage if the pagan partner 
takes the initiative. The case presented in verses 36-38, of the believing 
guardian of a virgin, who is given permission to marry her if he feels it 
necessary, does not belong to the earliest Christian age.
<P>
[7] x, 12-13 looks like an editor's addition. The whole passage is a homily 
on the sacrament of the Supper as understood in xi, 23-26.
<P>
[8] 12b-14 may be another editorial addition. On the general theme cf. 
1 Thessalonians ii, 1—12, Acts xx, 33—35.
<P>
[9] 17-18 again suspect as editorial.
<P>
[10] Note that the passage forbidding women to speak in the assemblies
<P>
<center>363</center>
<P>
conflicts with what is presupposed by xi, 3-16. But xiv, 33b-35 is evidently
interpolated.
<P>
[11] Interpolation is betrayed not only by the higher quality of the author's 
aim but by the forced connexions xii, 31 and xiv, 9, which are doublets. 
Moreover, xiii, 13, which contradicts what has gone before, seems to have 
been added to the song.
<P>
[12] The priority of ix is evident from the fact that, in it, the collections 
have not yet been made either in Macedonia or in Corinth, whereas in viii 
the Macedonian collection is ready and Paul has finished organizing the 
collection at Corinth. See Delafosse iii, 15-16.
<P>
[13] The insulting invectives against the Galilean apostles (cf. 1 Corinthians 
i, 2, 6, 13) are counterblasts to those which Revelation i—iii launches against 
Paul and his followers.
<P>
[14] For the help which came from Macedonia, cf. Philippians iv, 15, i6
and Acts xviii, 2, 3 (where it appears that the money brought from Macedonia 
enabled Paul to give himself entirely to his preaching).
<P>
[15] xi, 12b-xii, 4. If this apology is not from Paul himself, it is founded 
on more complete and precise information than canonical Acts. But the 
date assigned to the great vision in xii, 2 makes a difficulty. Paul's capital 
vision must have been that which converted him, which cannot have taken 
place about the year 40. (Can there be some influence here from Galatians 
ii, 1?)
<P>
[16] These are dealt with by Acts xiii, 14-xiv, 23; xvi, 1-5
<P>
[17] Marcion's version lacked i, 18-20, the personal visit to Peter; also the 
"again" in ii, i. But this passage, which fits so ill with the context, may 
well be an addition.
<P>
[18] v, 13-26; vi, 7-10, 12-16. It seems as though v, 1-12 should be attached 
to iv, 21-31, and that vi, 1—6 may be an addition; vi, 11 might rejoin the 
conclusion, 17-18.
<P>
[19] Many critics doubt whether the salutations of xvi, 3-16 (if not also 
xvi, 1-2, 21—22) originally belonged to Romans, and are inclined to think 
them addressed to the community at Ephesus. The final doxology, xvi, 
25-27, is recognized as a Marcionite addition, although the entire chapters 
xv-xvi were at first wanting in Marcion's <i>Apostolicon</i>.
<P>
[20] To the same gnosis belongs iii, 21-26, to which iv, 15, 25 are coordinated.
In the exposition of the gnosis vii, 7-25 seems of secondary 
origin.
<P>
[21] i, 18-iii, 20, where the indictment of the pagans, which has a rhetoric 
of its own, seems to have been borrowed from a Jewish source. In ii, 14, 15 
we may suspect a gloss.
<P>
[22] The fragment which follows xv, 7 seems lost in this place. In the 
moral part, the verses in respect for established authority (xiii, 1—7) are by 
a later hand; 8-12 depend on the Gospel tradition. The warning against 
heretics, xvi, 17-20, belongs to a time when gnostic editors were at work.
<P>
[23] The essential formula is Colossians i, 15-19, which should be compared
with Philippians ii, 6-10.
<P>
<center>364</center>
<P>
[24] Ephesus would be thought by the editors to have a better claim than 
Laodicea to an apostolic letter.
<P>
[25] Note the quotation of the baptismal hymn in v, 14. On the other hand, 
it results from ii, 20, iii, 5; iv, 11 that inspired prophets still stand with 
apostles in the first rank.
<P>
[26] ii, 6-11 is a short poem of Christian gnosis inserted by means of an 
artificial transition (verse 5).
<P>
[27] The rules of discipline in 1 Timothy ii-iii, 13 break into the warning 
against false teachers, thereafter resumed, while ii, 11-15a, forbidding 
women to teach (parallel to 1 Corinthians xiv, 34-35), is an evident surcharge 
in the rules about woman's dress, etc.
<P>
[28] Cf. especially 1 Clement, 36, 2; Hebrews i, 3-4.
<P>
[29] In ii, 3-4 the author expresses himself in much the same terms as the 
author of Luke i, 1-2. Similarly in xiii, 7, where the founders of the community
to which the Epistle is addressed are represented as belonging to a 
time long passed. Assuming that the community addressed was the Roman, 
the founders referred to would be Peter and Paul, here associated as we 
find them in Clement's Epistle.
<P>
[30] We get a glimpse of Gospel tradition only in ii, 3-4; v, 7-10 is com- 
monly regarded as a reference to the scene in Gethsemane; it refers in 
reality to Psalm xxii, on which the synoptic account was constructed.
<P>
[31] 2 Peter i. The announcement by Jesus of Peter's death (13-14), and 
the appeal to a great revelation on "the holy mountain," in which the 
apotheosis of the Christ is completed (16-19), refer to the Apocalypse of 
Peter, not to John xx, 18-19, nor to the Gospel stories of the transfiguration.
<P>
[32] In v, 12 the author forbids oath-taking in the terms of Matthew v, 34 
but without giving any sign that he is quoting a Gospel precept.
<P>
[33] 1 John v, 6-8 appears to be an interpolation to connect with John 
xix, 34-35 (water and blood, after the lance-thrust), a passage equally 
secondary in the fourth Gospel.
<P>
[34] Note that the author proves by Psalm cx, 1 that Jesus was not the 
son of David (cf. Mark xiii, 35-37).
<P>
[35] 1 Clement, 5. The two apostles appear as legendary heroes, Peter 
taking precedence of Paul, as in canonical Acts.
<P>
[36] The year 155, assigned by many as the date of Polycarp's martyrdom, 
ill accords with what we know of his coming to Rome in the time of Anicetus. 
It is more probable that Polycarp died under Marcus Aurelius, in 166, as 
Eusebius indicates. Thus the letter to the Philippians could have been written 
between 150 and 160.
<P>
[37] Note that while Christian apocalyptic had a fixed centre in the name 
of Jesus, Jewish apocalyptic was always rambling loosely round the topic 
of the Messiah, which was not definitely crystallized round an historical
name.
<P>
[38] The author of the Ascension proper seems to say (ix, 14) that "the 
god of this world" and his auxiliaries will crucify the Son of God without 
recognizing him; but in that he is not dependent on 1 Corinthians ii, 8.
<P>
<center>365</center>
<P>
He also seems to say that the Christ remained on the earth for eighteen
months after his resurrection, an opinion held by some of the gnostics.
<P>
[39] A translation of the Greek fragment and of the Ethiopian version will 
be found in Henneke, <i>Neutestamentliche Apokryphen</i>, 1923, pp. 314—327.
<P>
[40] The Akhmim fragment has a different order. It gives the first place to 
the felicity of the elect, two unnamed persons among the redeemed taking 
the place of Moses and Elijah as types of the promised glory.
<P>
[41] An obscure passage in the Ethiopian version but better preserved in 
the Greek fragment (cf. James in <i>The Journal of Theological Studies</i>, April 
1931, pp. 270-279).
<P>
[42] This can only be the Mount of Olives. Note the same designation, 
"holy mountain," in 2 Peter i, 18. 
<P>
[43] Cf. Bacon, <i>Studies in Matthew</i>, 146.
<P>
[44] The Church which Hermas sees in vision is already old. He took her 
at first to be the Sibyl {<i>Vision</i>, ii, 4); and the real Church as he knew it on 
earth has an experience of persecution acquired after the reign of Trajan.
<P>
[45] Virtues, vices, even impressions, are freely personified by Hermas. 
These personifications are not, with him, simple metaphors; they belong to 
the old Roman animism which put a god into every phenomenon. Thus he 
sees the Church in the form of a respectable matron. It would be difficult 
to understand why his shepherd, angel of penitence, should come from 
Arcadia, were it not that the image has been borrowed from a non-Christian 
type which we encounter again in the Hermetic Poimandres, in comparison 
with whom the Johannine Christ is acclaimed the true shepherd.
<P>
[46] 1 Apology, 66. The formula "Memoirs of the apostles" which is 
customary with Justin has no traditional warrant; he uses it to give distinction
to this literature which he somewhat boldly assimilates to Xenophon's
Memoirs about Socrates. It is not clear that Justin had the idea of a 
fixed canon; he appears to have made use in ordinary of the three Synoptics;
also of John and perhaps of the Gospel of Peter.
<P>
[47] <i>Heresies</i>, iii, 1. Note that Tatian's <i>Diatessaron</i>, about 170, is founded 
on the canonical Gospels and that Theophilus of Antioch, about 190, 
constructed a harmony of the four Gospels. The canon of four had become
law at Alexandria in the time of Clement, about 200.
<P>
[48] The priority of Mark results from the fact that it is to be considered 
as a source for Matthew and Luke. Beyond that it is impossible to assign 
precise dates to the stages of its revision.
<P>
[49] This conclusion is wanting in the oldest manuscripts, though it is of 
earlier date than they. The author of it knew the three other Gospels and 
Acts. It has been conjectured that it replaced another conclusion either lost 
or suppressed. The only fact of which we can be certain is that it was intended
to fill an obvious gap and bring Mark into line with the other Gospels.
<P>
[50] The Meal of the Anointing (xiv, 3-9) breaks up the prelude to the 
arrest and betrayal and, by anticipation, doubles the last meal, where everything
which concerns the Passover and the preparations for it is an interpolation
in the story of an ordinary meal which took place on 13 Nisan;
<P>
<center>366</center>
<P>
of this story (where verse 24 is obviously adventitious), xiv, 23, 25 is the 
debris. (See my <i>Les Livres du N. Testament</i>, 273-274.)
<P>
[51] Mark vi, 7-18 (Matthew x), mission of the Twelve; xii, 38—40, against 
the Pharisees (cf. Matthew xxiii), probably conceived in the source as the 
conclusion of the Jerusalem ministry.
<P>
[52] Cf. B. W. Bacon, <i>Is Mark a Roman Gospel?</i> 1919, and the criticism 
of this book in <i>Revue d'histoire et litterature religieuses</i>, 1920, p. 627, where 
we read "it was perhaps for want of something better that the Roman 
community first accepted this Gospel text."
<P>
[53] Eusebius, <i>History</i>, iv, 14, 1; v, 24, 16.
<P>
[54] The collection of Logia, or discourses, was made to meet the practical 
needs of Christian catechesis, and there is no reason whatever to suppose 
that its original author was a disciple of Jesus. That hypothesis appears 
self-evident only to those who hold that the reason for making the collection 
was the desire to get a fixed and authentic version of the teaching of the 
Christ. But the real reason was the need to provide the catechists with an 
adequate repertoire of matter for their teaching.
<P>
[55] The two prefaces are closely co-ordinate. On the mutilation of the 
preface to Acts in the editorial elaboration of that book, see my <i>Les Actes 
des Apotres</i>, 133-140.
<P>
[56] Duplicate of the mission of the Twelve, symbolic of the evangelization 
of Israel, and intended to signify the evangelization of the pagans already 
announced in iv, 16-30.
<P>
[57] Theme resumed in Acts i, 9-11. Its connexion with the Apocalypse 
of Peter has been noted above, p. 37. The role attributed to Herod in the 
passion of the Christ (xxiii, 6-12) brings the third Gospel rather near to 
the Gospel of Peter.
<P>
[58] The author effects his purpose by bringing together all the apparitions 
of the Risen One in a unitary perspective. There is reason to believe that 
the characteristic words of the mystical supper were absent in the original 
Luke and that the last meal was not there presented as the Passover meal. 
In this, its original form, the Gospel would therefore be earlier than the 
introduction of the Sunday Easter in the circle for which it was written, 
and if this circle was Roman it follows that the Gospel would be that of 
some Roman group which ignored or was unacquainted with the gnosis of 
the Epistles attributed to Paul, the harmonization of Mark and Luke having 
coincided with the unification of the various Roman groups.
<P>
[59] In the stories of the resurrection: Luke xxiv, 12 (perhaps authentic), 24, 
cf. John xx, 3—10; 36-40, cf. John xx, 19—21, 27. It is probable that in Acts 
xii, 1-2 the original document mentioned the death of John along with 
that of James, conformably to Mark x, 39 and to the testimony of Papias, 
and that the revision of the document which brings John to the front in 
the first chapter suppressed the mention of his execution in deference to the 
Ephesian legend.
<P>
[60] The hypothesis of an Aramaic original has been weightily maintained 
in recent times.
<P>
<center>367</center>
<P>
[61] In the perspective of the first three Gospels the Galilean ministry of 
Jesus seems to last a few months and the Jerusalem ministry a few days;
in John, the life of Jesus is crowned by a ministry of three whole years, 
he being regarded as forty-six when he began to teach—a symbolic trait 
(ii, 20). Such figures have mystical significance; but in all four Gospels 
chronology is only a framework for the distribution of evangelical matter.
<P>
[62] So far as we can speak of last editions prior to canonization, when 
the last retouchings of all four Gospels may well have been made at the same
time.
<P>
[63] Schmidke, <i>Neue Fragmente und Untersuchungen zu juden-christlicen 
Evangelien</i>, 1911, boldly contests Jerome's assertion, and even refuses him 
all knowledge of the Gospel in question. See on this subject Waitz in 
Henneke 10-32 and E. Meyer i, 261; these authors doubt only that Jerome 
made the double translation into Greek and Latin of which he boasts (<i>De 
viris</i>, 2).
<P>
[64] Waitz, 55, would attribute this citation to the Gospel of the Hebrews.
<P>
[65] Not having the context, it is impossible to say exactly what was the 
Easter observance of the Nazareans, except that their fast covered the whole 
time of the passion from the last meal to the resurrection.
<P>
[66] Waitz, 44 ff., is inclined to place it between 100 and 130, between the 
Synoptics and John.
<P>
[67] Collected and translated in Preuschen, <i>Antilegomena</i>, 2—3, 135—136.
<P>
[68] Salome comes on the scene and puts a question to Jesus about the 
end; Jesus insists on the disappearance from the perfect state of everything 
related to sex. Pretence of mystery on the subject.
<P>
[69] It is not certain nor even probable that it depends on the fourth Gospel 
in its canonical form; its spirit and composition belong rather to the pre-canonical time.                                                    
<P>
[70] Eusebius, vi, 12. Note that the bishop, without examining the book, 
permitted the reading of it in the community where he found it in use. On 
his attention being drawn afterwards to the Docetism of certain passages, 
he rejected it on that ground.
<P>
[71] According to Clement of Alexandria, <i>Stromata</i>, vii, 17, 106. Irenaeus 
(<i>Heresies</i>, iii, 11, 9) says the Gospel of Truth had nothing in common with 
the canonical Gospels. But had he read it?
<P>
[72] To these tendencies are attributed the suppression of all that concerns 
the earthly birth of the Christ, the non-paschal character of the last supper, 
etc. See Henneke, 74.
<P>
[73] It is evident that the earthly epiphany of the Christ was for a long 
time limited to the period between his baptism and resurrection—as in 
Mark, John, the Gospel of the Ebionites, Basilides, etc. The idea of miraculous
conception, by itself, is mythological and does not otherwise imply 
encratism. It is possible that the exaltation of Mary and the infant Jesus 
began in gnosis. On the <i>Genna Marias</i>, mentioned by Epiphanius, 26, 2, 
see Henneke, 82, 83, 109.
<P>
[74] The brothers and sisters of Jesus are represented in this book as the
<P>
<center>368</center>
<P>
children of an earlier marriage of Joseph who has become quite an old man 
when he married Mary. Jerome transformed the brothers and sisters of 
Jesus into his cousins. Western tradition has followed Jerome.
<P>
[75] The whole work of the Christian imagination in accounting for the 
origin of the religion is well summed up in the following quotation borrowed 
by Eusebius, ii, 1, 4, from the <i>Hypotyposes</i>, Book 7, of Clement of Alexandria:
"The Lord, after his resurrection, transmitted the gnosis to James the Just, 
to John and to Peter; these passed it on to the other apostles; the other 
apostles to the seventy disciples, of whom was Barnabas"—a fragment of 
Jewish-Christian gnosis. The canonical books (Gospels and Acts) are concerned, on the other hand, to transform the teachings of Jesus from post-resurrection utterances into discourses pronounced by him during his 
mortal life. But the gnostic tradition may well be, in all respects, the older.
<P>
[76] Observe that canonical Acts have collected a legend of Peter and a 
legend of Paul already considerably developed. The final edition of the 
book combines the two legends with facts having a surer basis, the whole 
forming an anti-gnostic synthesis—which brings us back to the preceding 
note. Henneke has good ground for saying (p. 140) that the question of 
spurious literature in primitive Christianity is still in need of investigation 
as a whole and fundamentally.
<P>
[77] These Clementine apocrypha are, perhaps, too neglected at the present 
time, though the school of Bauer made much of them in the middle of the 
last century. We have to distinguish the <i>Kerygmata</i>, which belong to 
Jewish-Christian gnosis from the <i>Praxeis</i>, a work of anti-gnostic Christianity 
recounting the combats between Peter and Simon Magus from Caesarea to 
Antioch. On the highly complicated history of these Clementine romances, 
see Henneke, 212—215, and 0. Culmann, <i>Le probleme litteraire et historique 
du roman pseudo-clementin</i>, 1930.

<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER II</h2></center>
<P>
[1] Annals, xv, 44: "Auctor hujus nominis Christus, Tiberio imperitante, 
per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat. Repressaque in 
praesens, exitialis superstitio sursus erumpebat, non modo per Judaeam, 
originem ejus mali, sed per Urbem etiam, quo cuncta undique atrocia aut 
turpia confluunt celebranturque."
<P>
[2] <i>Epistolae</i>, 96, 7. Christians under judicial interrogation told Pliny 
"quod essent soliti stato die ante lucem convenire carmenque Christo 
quasi deo dicere secum invicem." The <i>Carmen</i> is an alternating chant, hymn 
or liturgy. Pliny understands that the executed man, spoken of by Tacitus, 
is regarded as a god by his followers.

[3] Antiquities, xviii, 21: <font face="Symbol">Ta men loipa panta gnwmh twn Farisaiwn omologousa, duskinhtoV de tou eleuqerou erwV estin autoiV monon hgemona kai despothn ton qeon upeilhfosin</font>.
<P>
[4] From this we can see the meaning and importance of the question
<P>
<center>369</center>
<P>
about paying tribute to Caesar in the synoptic Gospels (Mark xii, 13-17 
and parallels). The story was invented to prevent Christianity being confused 
with the Judaism of the extremists. It is by no means certain that Jesus 
and his first followers would have shown so much consideration for Caesar's 
authority. Observe that Mark puts the question into the mouths of Pharisees 
and Herodians, for whom the question was important.
<P>
[5] The mistakes and exactions of the last procurators contributed to 
inflaming the religious passions of the Jews. As soon as revolution started 
in Jerusalem the friends of the Romans had to flee and, as the empire was 
then badly governed, rebellion was well organized before Vespasian was 
charged to suppress it.
<P>
[6] Herod was not less hated than the Romans, but more skilful in exacting 
obedience. It was the Jews themselves and the Samaritans who demanded 
and obtained the deposition of Archelaus in the year 6 of our era. But the 
mass of the people never settled down under Roman rule to which the 
upper class had accommodated itself. The fire smouldered till the explosion 
of the year 66.
<P>
[7] The date given in Luke iii, 1, if we take it as referring to the preaching 
of John the Baptist, is too late, although his activity as a preacher cannot 
have been of long duration; Simon Magus, whose date cannot be exactly 
given, was a contemporary of the apostolic age; Elchasai, founder of a 
baptist and judaizing sect in Transjordania, appeared about 100.
<P>
[8] With the difference, that Simon, in the legend, was regarded as having 
been a disciple of John; which is not so with Elchasai. In spite of what we 
read in Acts viii, 9-24, it is unlikely that Simon ever found his way into 
Christianity, but he may have had some connexion with John or with his 
sect.
<P>
[9] It reveals an effort to subordinate John to Jesus, by making John 
himself avow his subordination, or by drawing distinctions between the 
baptism of John and Christian baptism, but without success in disguising 
that the latter was borrowed from the former.
<P>
[10] <i>Antiquities</i>, xviii, 9, 2. The notice finds credit because it seems to be 
independent of the Gospel tradition. But it may not be really independent.
<P>
[11] Matthew xi, 11. But the end of verse 3: "Notwithstanding, he that is 
least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he," is a Christian addition 
intended to make the preceding statement inoffensive. It seems, however, 
that to give a better balance both to the text and the thought we ought, 
with many church fathers and some moderns, to take this saying in a strictly 
comparative sense: "he that is smaller than John"—in the order of time, 
junior by age and manifestation, that is to say, Jesus—"is, in the kingdom 
of heaven, greater than he." This interpretation saves the pre-eminence of 
Jesus, and his importance in regard to the kingdom, without excluding 
John from the number of the elect. The messianic programme announced 
in Matthew xi, 2-6, might very well be applied, in its principal elements, 
by John's sectaries to John and by Christians to Jesus.
<P>
[12] Mark i, 7-8 and parallels. As nobody can be either bathed or washed
<P>
<center>370</center>
<P>
in holy Spirit, it is obvious that baptism in spirit reposes on baptism in 
water, and the former has never existed apart from the latter.
<P>
[13] Mark i, 5 speaks of the desert, the region round the Dead Sea, as the 
scene of the preaching and of the Jordan as the scene of the baptizing, 
followed by Matthew iii, 1, 5. Luke all the region round about the Jordan 
as the scene of the preaching. The indications of place in John i, 28 and 
iii, 23, though more precise, are far from being more trustworthy.
<P>
[14] This baptism in running water was distinct from the legal ablutions. 
Holscher supposes it derived from the regions bordering on the Euphrates 
(Babylon) and from Mesopotamia. Renan thought the same. (<i>Vie de Jesus</i>, 
103; <i>Les Disciples</i>, 462-465.)
<P>
[15] Acts xviii, 24—28; xix, 1—6. From these notices we may conclude that 
Christian baptism was not originally understood as a baptism of spirit, as 
the editor of Acts would make out.
<P>
[16] Matthew ii, 1, connected with Micah v, 1; 13-15, where Hosea xi, 1, 
which refers to Israel, is made into a prediction of the flight into Egypt;
16-18, massacre of the children, linked to Jeremiah xxxi, 15, which concerns 
the Captivity; 19—23, return to Judea and settlement at Nazareth linked to 
the prophecy "he shall be called a Nazorean," of which it is very difficult to 
find the origin, unless we may suppose the evangelist to be applying to the 
Christ, by a play of words, the saying about Samson in Judges xiii, 5, "he 
shall be a <i>nazir</i>"; iv, 12—16, Jesus at Capernaum, presented as fulfilment of 
Isaiah viii, 23-ix, i, which refers to the Assyrian deportations.
<P>
[17] The legend preserved in Luke, while contradicting that in Matthew, 
is better arranged, but not more consistent.
<P>
[18] In Matthew (i, 1-17) Jesus descends from David through Solomon;
in Luke (iii, 23-38), through Nathan. But both come to a common termination
in Joseph, who was held to be the father of Jesus by the Jewish-Christian
circles in which the genealogies were invented.
<P>
[19] Ancient tradition was not unanimous on this point, as we may see 
from the anecdotes in Mark xii, 35-37 (and parallels) and from the so-called 
Epistle of Barnabas.
<P>
[30] Cf. Holscher, 230, n. 10; 239, n. 5. Ed. Meyer ii, 423, n. 2, maintains 
the connexion of the name with Nazareth. On the other hand, the existence 
of Nazareth at the time of Jesus has been denied, but wrongly. Nazareth 
was then in existence and only because it existed could it be used for a 
forced explanation of the title Nazorean when the effort was made to efface 
the original connexion of Jesus and his sect with the baptist sect of which 
they were really the issue. There is no etymological relation between 
Nazareth and the Nazareans or Nazoreans, whose Semitic names are written 
with a <i>tsade</i>, and the nazirs, which is written with a <i>zain</i>. The nazirs are 
"men under vow" (devoted). Nazorean probably means "observer."
<P>
[21] Matthew xi, 2-17 (Luke vii, 18-20, 22-25). On any interpretation the 
<i>mise en scene</i> and the statements attributed to the Christ reflect a polemic, 
courteous enough, between the sectaries of Jesus and the sectaries of John 
after the death of their respective leaders.
<P>
<center>371</center>
<P>
[22] It was in this character that the story (Mark i, 9-11 and parallels) 
occupied the first place in Gospel catechizing. The story was not conceived 
to show that Jesus had belonged to John's sect, but to disguise it. The 
intention was to show forth the messianic initiation of Jesus.
<P>
[23] The dove in the story is a mythological element somewhat time-worn. 
Nevertheless it is not without significance that the bird of Astarte becomes 
the emblem of the Spirit who, in the Gospel of the Hebrews, is expressly 
said to be the mother of the Christ.
<P>
[24] This word (<font face="Symbol">dunameiV</font>) is found in the saying attributed to Herod 
Antipas about the miracles attributed to Jesus.
<P>
[25] For an analysis of the miracle stories in the synoptic tradition see 
Bultmann, 129-150.
<P>
[26] They are so represented in the Acts of the Apostles and in the Epistles, 
especially in those to the Corinthians. Observe also what is said in Mark 
xvi, 17-18.
<P>
[27] The journey chiefly in question is that mentioned in Mark vii, 24, 31, 
the itinerary of which is extremely vague. Critics since Wellhausen who 
suppose it to have an historical basis, by connecting Luke xiii, 31-32 with 
Mark 14-16, have drawn the conclusion that Jesus quitted Galilee because of 
the Tetrarch's threatening attitude. But, in Mark, the journey to Tyre is 
contrived to bring in the story of the Canaanite woman, and the return 
through Decapolis to provide a frame for the miracles of the deaf-mute 
and the second multiplication of loaves, all of them stories whose symbolic 
meaning will hardly be contested. On the other hand, the anecdote in 
Luke, which floats in air without attachment, is equally without historical 
consistency. It may well be that the hostility of the Tetrarch had a part in 
determining Jesus to make for Jerusalem; but there is nothing to prove that 
this motive induced Jesus to take so long a journey beyond the confines of 
Galilee.
<P>
[28] Matthew iv, 25; Luke vi, 17. The <i>mise en scene</i> which in Mark iii, 
7-12 is the frame for a mass of miracles is no less artificial than the arrangement
of the discourse which follows them.
<P>
[29] For analysis of the teaching attributed to Jesus in the synoptics see 
especially Bultmann, 4-129.
<P>
[20] In the <i>Encyclopedia Biblica</i>, ii, art. "Gospels." Goguel, <i>La Vie du 
Jesus</i>, is more recent.
<P>
[21] Mark xv, 34; Matthew xxvii, 46. The saying is taken from Psalm 
xxii, 2. For this cry of despair Luke substitutes words of confidence borrowed 
from Psalm xxxi, 5, "into thy hand I commit my spirit." John substitutes 
"it is finished" (xix, 30).
<P>
[32] Mark ii, 27. The sentence is not reproduced in the parallels perhaps 
because its character is rather philosophic than religious.
<P>
[33] The mention of "the brothers of the Lord" in i Corinthians ix, 5 and 
in Galatians i, 19 (James) confirms the indication in Mark vi, 3 (Matthew 
xiii, 55, 56) concerning the brothers, enumerated by name, and the sisters 
of Jesus, although the scene of the preaching at Nazareth may be constructed
<P>
<center>372</center>
<P>
to make way for the aphorism "no prophet has honour in his own country."
Cf. Bultmann, 15, 29. Taken by itself the mention of the mother and 
brothers of Jesus in Acts i, 14 would be open to suspicion.
<P>
[34] Mark i, 15; Matthew iv, 17. This feature is omitted in the parallel 
passage, Luke iv, 14-15; not, perhaps, without intention.
<P>
[35] Granting that the reign of the Spirit began in the Christian community 
after the resurrection of Jesus, Christian baptism properly so-called cannot 
have been conferred before (cf. John xx, 22-23; Acts ii, 1-4, 37-38). But 
that idea is forced. In John iii, 22-26 it is stated that Jesus baptized; then, 
iv, 2, that he did not baptize, but that his disciples took his place in that 
office; finally, vii, 39, that "as yet there was no Spirit." These statements 
are contradictory, the result of theological embarrassment, the last two 
apparently glosses. Weak as is the historical authority of the fourth Gospel, 
it is clear that the chief author of it found nothing inconvenient in the idea 
that preaching and baptism went together both with Jesus and with John.
<P>
[36] <i>Vie de Jesus</i>, 312-319. Renan forces the point both in the historicity 
he attributes to the texts and in the highly poetic commentary he passes 
on them. But the fundamental idea may be retained. Observe that, in regard 
to baptism, takes John iii, 22—23 and iv, 1 as literal history, while seeing in 
iv, 2 a gloss or a scruple of the editor.
<P>
[37] It should never be forgotten that an ordinary meal, especially certain 
meals of primitive and ancient peoples, had a religious character. It was so 
among the Jews and in particular among the Essenes.
<P>
[38] Daniel vii, 13; Parables of Enoch. In the Pauline gnosis the Heavenly 
Man, by contrast to the first Adam, is identical with the Son of Man of the 
Gospel tradition. But this transcendental idea of the Messiah is not of 
Jewish origin. The anointed of Jahveh was at first and remained, in 
essentials, a man.
<P>
[39] Granting the pagan origin of the notion and the influence of Chaldeo-Iranian
tradition on Jewish eschatology and apocalyptic, there is not much 
room for hypothesis. The thesis of a Chaldeo-Iranian origin has been 
developed by Reitzenstein. Holscher (192, n. 2) adopts it in the main; but 
the history of the myth and of its evolution is still obscure. There seems 
no reason to think that the myth had any influence on the preaching of 
Jesus, but it is far otherwise with the apostolic tradition.
<P>
[40] Reitzenstein, <i>Das iranische Erosungs mysterium</i>, 130, maintains that 
Jesus accepted and used "the Man" in an eschatological sense and with 
a feeling of his own for union with God which can hardly have been 
borrowed. Obscure theology, to which Holscher, <i>sup. cit.</i>, does not adhere. 
This transcendent and mythical notion of "the Man" is much more easily 
attributed to Jesus conceived as risen from the dead than to Jesus himself 
in his lifetime. The latter hypothesis would make the primitive Gospel of 
Jesus much more gnostic than it really was.
<P>
[41] Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, xx, 5, 1; 8, 6; <i>War</i>, ii, 13, 5.
<P>
[42] Implied by the editor of Acts, v, 35-39, in the words he puts into the 
mouth of Gamaliel.
<P>
<center>373</center>
<P>
[43] Mark xi, 11 and xiii, 1-2 has sometimes been cited to prove that
Jesus and his disciples had never previously seen Jerusalem. This is transforming
the little arts of the Gospel editors into facts of history.
<P>
[44] Each of the two hypotheses has supporters. They are not incompatible 
and each can be supported by texts. But the texts are not as consistent as 
they would need to be to furnish support. That the preaching of Jesus had 
staggering success is not probable, nor that it lasted long before alarming 
the Tetrarch.
<P>
[45] The previsions attributed to him are conceived systematically in 
respect to the facts foreseen, as well as to the prophecies regarded as fulfilled 
by his passion. Thus the agony in Gethsemane, which the fourth Gospel 
is at pains to suppress, localizes a scene, deduced from Psalm xxii, but 
originally without specification of time and place, as we find it in Hebrews 
v, 7-10, where it is taken directly from the Psalm and is not, as many 
suppose, an echo of the Gospel story.
<P>
[46] Zechariah ix, 9; Genesis xlix, 11; Psalm cxviii, 25—26. If we admit 
the historicity of this triumphal entry into the city it would necessarily 
follow that Jesus deliberately set himself to fulfil the prophecy of Zechariah 
ix, 9. Did he, then, intend to inaugurate the Great Event on the Mount of 
Olives? In that case he falls into line with "the Egyptian" who according 
to Josephus had the same intention. But the kind of evidence on which the 
tradition reposes (fulfilment of supposed prophecies) gives not the slightest 
support to the historicity of the facts narrated.
<P>
[47] The expulsion of the traders fulfils Zechariah xiv, 20; Malachi iii, i. 
If Jesus and his followers had violently taken possession of the temple 
court, the incident would not have terminated in an academic debate as to 
the authority under which Jesus claimed to act; the Roman garrison would 
have arrested him on the spot. Compare the case of Paul in Acts xxi, 27-34.
<P>
[48] The incidents recorded of the Jerusalem ministry—academic discussion 
on the authority of Jesus and of John, on tribute to Caesar, on the resurrection,
on the David's sonship of the Messiah, and the rating of the 
Pharisees—were conceived independently of each other, and then linked 
together by artificial transitions for the purpose of filling the Jerusalem 
ministry with sufficient contents.
<P>
[49] The opinion recently defended by R. Eisler (<i>Jesus Basileus</i>, 1930) 
with great erudition but feeble proofs. The additions to Josephus' <i>Jewish 
War</i> in the Sclavonic version, on which Eisler chiefly relies, are probably 
interpolations and, even if authentic, do not contain all he would draw out 
of them.
<P>
[50] The legend of Judas is out of harmony with the legend of the Twelve 
to which the attempt has been made to weld it. In reality Jesus did not 
choose the Twelve. They were the committee to which the first community 
of believers entrusted the management of their affairs after the death of 
Jesus. Their appointment has been antedated to the time of his ministry. 
On the other hand, the treachery of Judas has no sense unless we suppose 
him to have been one of the chief disciples. In the apostolic list Judas, the
<P>
<center>374</center>
<P>
traitor, occupying the last place, is a pendant to Peter, the renegade, 
occupying the first place. The legend of his death in Matthew xxvii, 3-10 
and Acts i, 16—20 is wholly fictitious, and the legend of his treason, founded 
on some texts of the Old Testament, may have no more reality than the 
story of Peter's denial. Cf. Bultmann, 159, 167, 171.
<P>
[51] Mark xiv, 27 (Matthew xxvi, 31), where the flight of the disciples is 
represented as announced in Zechariah xiii, 7. John xvi, 32 is in line with 
Mark, but without the reference to prophecy. In Luke there is no flight of 
the disciples from Jerusalem; they remain there and Jesus accordingly is 
made only to predict the failure of their faith (xxii, 32).
<P>
[52] The dramatization of the incident goes <i>crescendo</i> in Mark, Matthew, 
John.
<P>
[53] Mark xiv, 17-21; Matthew xxvi, 21-25; Luke xxii, 31-34; John xiii, 
36—38. Bultmann, 162, thinks that the sources of Luke xxii, 31-32 knew 
nothing of the denial (<font face="Symbol">epistrezaV</font> being an editorial insertion; but it may 
be understood in the active = "bringing back"). The fact is that the whole 
story of the denial has the look of a later addition.
<P>
[54] Mark xiv, 22-24; Matthew xxvi, 26-28; Luke xxii, 19-20. In Luke 
the end of verse 19, after <font face="Symbol">to uper umwn didomenon</font>, and verse 20 seem 
to be late additions, coming from 1 Corinthians xi, 24-25 (completed by 
Mark xiv, 24). The reviser of Luke and Acts knew the Eucharist as a breaking 
of bread and it seems that in the revision of Luke he had in mind at first 
its eschatological meaning (the banquets of the elect in the coming Kingdom),
the author of the sources being ignorant of the mystic meaning 
contained in 1 Corinthians. His ignorance is not surprising if the mystic 
meaning did not originate with Paul.
<P>
[55] The elements of this older version are embedded in Mark xiv, 23, 25. 
The words, "Take, this is my body," seem to have been inserted in place 
of the original, "Verily I say unto you I will eat no more bread," etc., a 
formula parallel to, "I will drink no more wine," etc., in verse 25 and in 
Luke xxii, 15-18. In the latter mention of the Passover has been substituted 
for "bread," so as to make the Last Supper into a pascal feast.
<P>
[56] The scene in Gethsemane has been compressed and transported in a 
very curious way in John xii, 27-33, when the agony appears to dissolve 
into an echo of the transfiguration.
<P>
[57] Dramatization is obvious in the story as given in each of the Synoptics. 
The object is to present the Christ as master of his destiny. See <i>Revue 
d'histoire et de litterature religieuses</i>, 1922, p. 445.
<P>
[58] This trial, in Mark and Matthew, is composed of three elements 
easily distinguishable: (1) the saying about the temple which Jesus boasts 
he could destroy and rebuild in three days, and the testimony in relation to 
it—a saying which embarrassed the tradition, and which, if Jesus really 
pronounced it, would have been brought up in evidence before Pilate as 
proof of messianic pretentions; the authentic version of the saying would 
be in Matthew xxvi, 61, in preference to Mark xiv, 58 and John ii, 19, which 
expressly give it an allegorical meaning; (2) the messianic declaration made
<P>
<center>375</center>
<P>
bv Jesus as Son of God, a correction in advance of the condemnation of 
Jesus as King of the Jews and intended to account for this condemnation 
by the blindness of the Jewish authorities in presence of the mystic Christ, 
the divine Saviour; (3) finally, the scene of the outrages inflicted on the 
Christ (Mark xiv, 65; Matthew xxvi, 67-68), which is a fulfilment of 
prophecies, especially of Isaiah i, 5 and liii, 3. The last two elements are 
fictitious; as to the first, there is fiction at least in the setting.
<P>
[59] The morning session of the Sanhedrim (Mark and Matthew), in 
which Luke (xx, 66 and xxiii), who omits the night session, has lodged the 
trial, is a duplicate of the condemnation. In the source document this was 
probably the meeting at which the accusers draw up the charge to be brought 
before Pilate. Matthew tacks on to it the legend of the repentant Judas. In 
all four Gospels the story of the trial by Pilate is cut in two by the incident 
of Barabbas, invented less for the purpose of dramatization than to transfer, 
from Pilate to the Jews, the responsibility for the condemnation, which is 
now fixed on the Jews by the most artificial of devices. In this way Pilate 
is made the judge in a comic opera in which the trial loses its legal form. 
The intervention of Pilate's wife, in Matthew, is another attempt to white-wash
the procurator. Pilate is represented as unable, in law, to refuse ratification
of a sentence pronounced by the Sanhedrim according to rule. Thus 
arranged, the editor's version of the story defies both logic and probability.
<P>
[60] Annas (Hanan) had been deposed since the year 15.
<P>
[61] Jesus being regarded as a political agitator, his case would be dealt 
with by the Roman authority and not left to be tried by the Sanhedrim.
<P>
[62] It seems certain, however, that the Sanhedrim had then the right to 
carry out a sentence of death pronounced in a case which came within its 
sphere of jurisdiction.
<P>
[63] Every conceivable subtlety has been employed to reconcile the time-table
of the Synoptics with that of John. They cannot be reconciled. If "traditional"
be taken as meaning "historical" neither of the conflicting dates is 
more traditional than ths other. But the synoptic date is secondary to the 
Johannine, the chain of stories which make up the ritual drama of the 
passion having been originally invented to fit what may be called the Johannine
hypothesis of the Christ as the pascal lamb. While it is probable that 
Jesus came to Jerusalem for the Passover and was crucified on one of the 
days of the week before the feast, it is not impossible that he came at another 
time of the year, and that the coincidence of the passion with the Passover 
was founded solely on mystical reasons, the meaning of the feast being 
promptly Christianized by the hellenist Christians.
<P>
[64] It would be that of the first generation if it be true that the idea of 
the Christ as Son of Man and Son of God was accepted at once by the 
earliest community. So thinks Bousset (<i>Kyrios Christos</i>, 20) supporting 
his view, in the first place, on 1 Corinthians xv, taken as testimony of Paul. 
There is no reason, however, for holding that belief in Jesus, as transfigured 
into the Christ by his resurrection, was at once expanded into the idea of 
the Man-Christ pre-existent to his appearance on earth.
<P>
<center>376</center>
<P>
[65] The cohort which accompanies Judas is a happy thought for enhancing
the scene of the arrest. Had Jesus been arrested by a cohort of 
Roman soldiers the affair would have taken a very different turn.
<P>
[66] This story betrays a respect for Roman authority which can hardly 
have existed in the ranks of Christian believers before Hellenist Christianity 
had become widely spread.
<P>
[67] According to the dates commonly accepted for the canonical Gospels, 
the Gospel of Peter would have to be in dependence upon Luke. The 
relation of the two Gospels is probably more complex. The Herod incident 
in Luke has not the air of an improvised fiction, but seems rather to be 
the compressed version of a story parallel to that of the trial before Pilate, 
which had a place in the original framework of the Gospel.
<P>
[68] These facts form the background, but less as memories than as 
themes to exploit, explain and interpret in the ritual, that is, in the mystical 
poem of the passion.
<P>
[69] Jerome, Ep. lviii (<i>Latin Patrology</i>, xxii, col. 581): "Ab Hadriani 
temporibus usque ad imperium Constantini... in loco Resurrectionis 
simulacrum Jovis; in crucis rupe, statua ex marmore Veneris a gentibus 
posita colebatur. . . . Bethleem nunc nostram, et augustissimum orbis 
locum . . . lucus obumbrabat Thamuz, id est Adonidis, et in specu, ubi 
quondam Christus parvulus vagiit, Veneris amasius plangebatur." Places 
consecrated to pagan cults in Jerusalem may well have been requisitioned 
for consecration to the risen Christ just as the grotto at Bethlehem, consecrated to
Adonis, was requisitioned for his birth.
<P>
[70] John xix, 17 says that Jesus carried his cross; this to indicate the Christ's 
independence of mortal aid and his willing acceptance of death.
<P>
[71] The aromatic wine is in Mark xv, 23; it may well have been the first 
form under which the fulfilment of Psalm lxix, 22 was indicated. It is from 
this Psalm that Matthew takes the gall, which he substitutes for the myrrh 
of Mark. The offering of vinegar, doubling in Mark and Matthew that of 
the wine mixed with spices, comes in all four Gospels as the last incident 
before the death of the Christ. The adventitious character of the incident is 
most perceptible in Mark (xv, 37), where we read that Jesus, having emitted 
a loud cry, breathed his last. This cry, which is inarticulate, was that mentioned
in the original document; the previous citation of Psalm xxii, with 
all that follows from it, is a second version of the original, added by the 
evangelist.
<P>
[72] Variations in the synoptics on the theme furnished by Psalm xxii, 7-9. 
Luke makes one of the robbers insult Jesus and converts the other, the 
incident of the good robber being substituted for all in Mark and Matthew 
that relates to the quotation from Psalm xxii, 2.
<P>
[73] Fulfilment of Psalm xxii, 19, wliich John xix, 23-24 cites expressly, 
taking pains to distinguish, in spite of the text he is quoting, between the 
friendly division of the garments and the casting of lots for the robe. See 
my <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 486.
<P>
[74] We have seen above the meaning, in Mark and Matthew, of the
<P>
<center>377</center>
<P>
citation of Psalm xxii, 2 and the substitution for it by Luke and John. The
latter (xix, 25-27) places the mystic testament of the Christ—the sayings or 
Jesus to his mother and to the beloved disciple—before the last words.
<P>
[75] John suppresses this, the death of his Christ being triumphal. The 
prodigy seems to have been added to Mark xv, 33. Probably intended as 
the fulfilment of Amos viii, 9-10.
<P>
[76] Also wanting in John. In the Synoptics the incident means what we 
read in Hebrews vi, 19-20 and x, 19-20. By the rending of the veil of his 
flesh the Christ enters the heavenly sanctuary, there to offer his blood, and 
thus open eternal life to the believer.
<P>
[77] John xix, 31-37. Fulfilment of Exodus xii, 44 (Psalm xxxiv, 21) and of 
Zechariah xii, 10. The incident of the lance thrust may have been suggested 
by the last text. For the symbolic explanation connect with 1 John v, 6-7. 
This mystical imagery is good compensation for the centurion's profession 
of faith in the synoptic story and the rending of the veil. The substitution 
of the one symbol for the other may well have been deliberate.
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER III</h2></center>
<P>
[1] The name "field of blood" is appropriate to a place of burial, but not 
to a cemetery "for strangers" (Matthew xxvii, 7). The idea indicated by the 
name is that of a burial place reserved for those who came to a bloody end 
in a violent or infamous death, such as suicides and executed criminals. 
Nothing could be more obviously artificial than the connexion of this 
place with "the price of blood"—the thirty pieces of silver which Judas is 
said to have received from the priests for betraying Jesus. The fiction 
contained in Matthew xxvii, 3-10, laying violent hands on certain Biblical 
texts (Zechariah xi, 12-13, amalgamated with Jeremiah xxxii, 6-9), has 
imagined a connexion between the money and the name of the place;
while another fiction (Acts i, 16-20), based on other texts (Psalms lxix. 26;
cix, 8), contradicts the first and connects the name with the blood of Judas, 
which it spills on the field bought by him with the high priests' money 
and where he is said, literally, to have burst. The two versions of the myth 
denounce each other as inventions and cancel out. "The field of blood" 
existed before the time of Jesus. We may conjecture that the original tradition 
retained some memory of a connexion between Aceldama and the crucified 
Jesus and that later on, when the Christ had been furnished with a befitting 
tomb, from which his body had miraculously disappeared to prove him 
risen from the dead, this connexion with Aceldama was shifted from Jesus 
to Judas.
<P>
[2] Cf. Acts xiii, 29, and see <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 496-498. 
<P>
[3] Matthew xxvi, 60, attributing the tomb to Joseph. Luke xxiii, 53
has "a tomb in which no man had yet been buried," followed by John who
for symbolism, places the tomb in a garden.
<P>
<center>378</center>
<P>
[4] Mark xv, 46; xvi, 4 insisting on the great size of the stone; Matthew 
xxvii, 60 does the same; Luke xxiv 2 merely mentions the presence of the 
stone.
<P>
[5] The correspondence of this timing, in distribution, with the ritual of 
Adonis cannot be fortuitous.
<P>
[6] John xx, 17. In the interpolated passage, 2-10, Mary of Magdala, 
before she yet knows that Jesus is risen, gives the information to Peter and 
the beloved disciple.
<P>
[7] It was invented in order to conceal the real condition of the burial 
behind a fulfilment of prophecies.
<P>
[8] These gnostic revelations are founded on instructions given by the 
risen Christ. So, too, are the Pauline gnosis and the Apocalypse of Peter.
<P>
[9] Examples may be found in the discourses which the editor of Acts puts
into the mouths of Peter and of Paul when addressing Jewish audiences. 
These discourses represent the apology for Christianity as presented to the 
Jews in the earliest Christian times.
<P>
[10] John xx. The apparitions described in this chapter form the climax 
and bring the story to a definite end. On them the Church was founded. 
Chapter xxi is an addition. The Galilean apparition first described in it 
can by no possibility be fitted into the framework of xx. It is a parallel 
story, with a more limited purpose, which the author of xx, if he knew of it, 
decided to leave out.
<P>
[11] J. Weiss, <i>Das Urchristentum</i>, 11; R. Schutz, <i>Apostel und Junger</i>, 
1921, pp. 98 ff. Cf. E. Meyer, iii, 216, n. 1. But Meyer is over-hasty in deciding 
that a vision of Peter and study of Scripture immediately established the 
faith of the apostolic group; that a vision of the Twelve determined their 
return to Jerusalem and that Psalm cx caused them to give Jesus the title 
of "Lord." The requisitioning of texts did not originate this faith but followed
its onward movement.
<P>
[12] The word <font face="Symbol">ekklesia</font> is found again in Matthew xviii, 17, which is 
in the same current of tradition; but there <font face="Symbol">ekklesia</font> simply means "community."
<P>
[13] Mention omitted in Matthew xxvii, 7.
<P>
[14] John xxi, 15-17. The triple protestation of love, with a triple investiture 
in answer, seems designed to correspond with the triple denial, by way of 
reparation.
<P>
[15] So much may be retained as historical from Acts ii, 42-46; vi, 2—3.
<P>
[16] Acts iii-iv, 22. For criticism of this story see my <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 
222-251. The name of John at the side of Peter is a later addition;
this out of respect for the Ephesian legend and its saint. We shall see later 
that the same preoccupation has caused John's name to be omitted after 
that of James (xii, 2). In the story before us, the discourse of Peter, his 
arrest and appearance before the Sanhedrim appear to have been invented 
by the editor to fill out the picture.
<P>
[17] This concludes the original story.
<P>
[18] In place of these cramped conditions, which the charity of believers
<P>
<center>379</center>
<P>
could, or would, correct when they ran to extremes, the editor of Acts 
gives us glimpses of a fairly comfortable state of things in which pious 
sages live in common on a fund continually renewed, under God's blessing, 
bv the accession of new members who bring into it all they have. Preuschen, 
<i>Die Apostelgeschichte</i>, 28, compares it with what we are told of Pythagoras 
and his disciples. But the editor is more likely to have been inspired directly 
by what Josephus says about the Essenes.
<P>
[19] Documentation in Harnack, <i>Mission und Ausbreitimg des Christentums</i>,
13, 307 ff.
<P>
[20] Mark iv, 7-13, 30; cf. Matthew x. Luke ix, 1-6, 10 has the resume of 
Mark's missionary discourse addressed to "the twelve apostles," and in x, 
1-24 he gives the same discourse <i>in extenso</i> and makes it addressed to 
"seventy-two other disciples," as he found it in the source used also by 
Matthew. These seventy-two disciples are figures of the missionaries of the 
Gentiles, and the doubling is in keeping with the fiction which reserves 
the status of apostles to the Twelve.
<P>
[21] Acts vi, 13. The elements of the text are contradictory: we are told 
of a legal trial before the Sanhedrim while the execution is an affair of mob 
violence. Many think there was no trial and that Stephen perished in a 
riot, stoned to death by the audience whom some discourse of his had 
scandalized. There is no proof whatever that the trial is a faint copy of the 
trial of Jesus by the high priest in the Gospels. The editor seems to have been 
unwilling to let Stephen be condemned on the charges brought against him 
before the Sanhedrim, offences against the Law of Moses. His thesis was 
better suited by having him massacred for reproaching the Jews for their 
agelong infidelity.
<P>
[22] If Jesus ever uttered this saying, he did not understand it in the sense 
in which Stephen seems to have interpreted it.
<P>
[23] Acts vii, 58, 60. All this is an interpolation in the account of the 
stoning.
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER IV</h2></center>
<P>
[1] Cf. Heitmuller, <i>Zum Problem Paulus und Jesus</i>, Z.N.W., 1912, 320-
327; Bousset, <i>Kyrios Christos</i>, 92.
<P>
[2] The notice in Acts xi, 26 does not mean that the name "Christians" 
was bestowed on the Antioch disciples all at once, but that the pagans were 
not slow in so naming them. No doubt the pagans, constantly hearing the 
name "Christ" invoked by the new believers, took it for a proper name and 
thought they were calling the sect after its founder. The same would hold 
true of Tacitus, "Auctor hujus nominis Christus" {Annals, xv, 44).
<P>
[3] The story about Simon in Acts viii, 5-25 is interpolated and incoherent. 
In certain respects Simon is the chief actor in it. But it seems that an earlier 
story put him in relation only with Philip from whom he wished to buy 
the power to work miraculous cures, which the editor of Acts turned into
<P>
<center>380</center>
<P>
a proposal to buy the Holy Spirit from Peter. In the first version Simon 
was denounced as a sorcerer, while in the story before us he and his sect 
are belittled in comparison with Christianity. The legend of Peter's relations 
with Simon was largely developed in later tradition and it is probable that 
the editor got hold of it while in process of development. It is doubtful 
not only whether Simon ever received Christian baptism, as the story 
declares, but whether he had any direct relations either with Philip or with 
Peter. His reputation as the father of heretical gnosis rests upon the fact 
that he was contemporary with the apostolic age and that his sect came 
into competition with nascent Christianity.
<P>
[4] Acts ix, 32—35; cure of a paralytic at Lydda (on the model of the 
paralytic in Luke v, 18-24); raising Dorcas from the dead at Joppa (ix, 
36-43, on the model of Jairus' daughter, Luke v, 21-24, 35-43, and the 
resurrection performed by Elijah and Elisha). These miracles are localized 
at Lydda and Joppa so as to bring Peter to Caesarea, the Roman political 
headquarters, as the right place for the conversion of a Roman centurion.
<P>
[5] See <i>Les Mysteres paiens et le Mystere Chretien</i>, 144-146, 153-155.
<P>
[6] There seems to be no doubt as to the fact of the relationship, although 
we are ignorant of the circumstances in which the relations of Jesus joined 
the group of Galilean believers. The James who is the chief figure in the 
first community when Paul comes to Jerusalem for the last time (Acts xxi, 
18) is the brother of Jesus and he is the identical James who, in Galatians ii, 
9, is counted as a "pillar" along with Peter and John. On his first journey 
Paul interviewed him and Cephas at the same time; but we have seen 
above that Galatians i, 18-20 is probably not primitive in the Epistle. 
The two sons of Zebedee (John and the other James) seem to have had a 
rather important standing by the side of Peter; but the probability is that 
both of them perished in 44, while Peter had to flee from the city. James, 
brother of the Lord, would then become the chief person in the Jerusalem 
community.
<P>
[7] The legend was conceived in the same spirit as the great saying which 
appointed Peter the keeper of the keys of the kingdom (Matthew xvi, 17—19) 
and, like it, must have had a Syro-Palestinian origin. But the origin cannot 
have been narrowly Jewish-Christian. It is in point to remember that Paul, 
who was never chief figure at Antioch during his life, was bound to fall 
still further into the background there after his death. Even in the communities
of Syria and Palestine that leaned towards hellenism, legend 
would there tend to work in Peter's favour.
<P>
[8] The tale fits in with the fiction of ix, 22-26a, where Paul is made to 
preach at Damascus, then has him introduced to the apostles by Barnabas, 
and brings him back to Tarsus, whither Barnabas goes to seek him in order 
to bring him to Antioch. The whole story, including the commission given 
to Barnabas by the Jerusalem community to go to Antioch and see what 
has happened there is aimed at making the Twelve the prime authors of all 
propaganda. It is certain that Barnabas did not remain in Jerusalem after 
the death of Stephen.
<P>
<center>381</center>
<P>
[9] The mention of Barnabas as "Joseph called Barnabas, a Levite of 
Cyprus," in iv, 36-37, really belongs to xiii, 1 and is an anticipation. The 
former passage as a whole (36-37) is of a piece with the fictions indicated 
in the notes above and is highly suspect. If Barnabas was a Cypriot, it is not 
likely that he would have land to sell in Judea. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 
262-265.
<P>
[10] These statements express an ardent conviction which goes beyond 
the reality of the facts it brings to light. The disproportion between 
statement and fact may be explained either by Paul's visionary temperament
or by the intervention of an editor who, at a later date, introduced 
into the Epistle a highly systematic interpretation of the facts in question.
<P>
[11] Acts xi, 26 seems to reduce the common mission of Paul and Barnabas 
at Antioch to one full year before their journey to Jerusalem (xi, 30) and 
the mission in Cyprus and Lycaonia which they are said to have accomplished 
together. As to the journey, it took place at the date indicated (end of 43 
or beginning of 44), but the motive of it was the question of the legal 
observances. As to the mission, it was probably not carried out in the 
conditions indicated but replaces the mission to Syria and Cilicia, mentioned 
in Galatians i, 21-24, which must have filled the greater part of the fourteen 
years (according to Galatians ii, i) between Paul's conversion and his 
journey to Jerusalem to discuss the question of legal observances. See <i>Les 
Actes des Apotres</i>, 474-476, 506.
<P>
[12] Acts ix, 1-30. The story suppresses the mission-journey in Arabia 
(the Nabatean kingdom) mentioned in Galatians i, 17, and, in the face of 
all likelihood makes Paul begin preaching immediately in Damascus and in 
Jerusalem in contradiction to Galatians i, 17 and 22.
<P>
[13] Compare 2 Corinthians xii, 14, where mention is made of a culminating 
vision, which is not described but may well have been, in the mind of the 
author, the vision which led to Paul's conversion.
<P>
[14] Acts ix, 10-16: here the mission is outlined in a vision that comes to 
Ananias and in keeping with all that Acts will tell about Paul; Acts xxii, 1:
here the mission is to the Gentiles, plainly announced in a vision Paul is 
said to have had in the temple at Jerusalem, after his conversion; Acts xxvi, 
16-18: here the mission is laid down by Jesus himself in the original vision.
<P>
[15] The fiction is not the journey into Arabia; that journey explains the 
intervention of the Nabatean ethnarch at Damascus (related in 2 Corinthians
xi, 32-33) which determined Paul to flee the city and for which 
Acts ix, 23-25 substitutes a Jewish plot to kill him. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 
414-421.
<P>
[16] Cf. Acts ix, 26-30 and Galatians i, 18-20. It has been pointed out 
above that the editor of Acts in ix, 26-30 and xi, 22-26 manoeuvres Barnabas 
and Paul with a view to making it appear that the foundation of the 
Christian groups at Antioch and elsewhere in Syria and Cilicia depend in 
the closest possible way on the apostles in Jerusalem, to whom in reality 
those foundations owed nothing at all. It will be noted that if Galatians i, 
18-20 is a fiction (as it seems to be) pointing in the same direction as Acts
<P>
<center>382</center>
<P>
ix, 26-30, then the interpolator of it can have only half understood what 
the fiction in Acts was aimed at, for he is concerned only to subordinate 
Paul to Peter.
<P>
[17] On this letter, of the year 41, see Seston, <i>L'empereur Claude et les 
chretiens</i> in <i>Revue d'histoire et de philosophie religieuses</i>, 1931, No. 3. The 
letter clearly attests the attention the Roman government is paying to 
Jewish affairs, the fear it has of Jewish agitations which starting at one point 
might have repercussions through all the empire, and its intention to suppress 
these disturbances. But it remains possible, even probable, that Christian 
preaching had something to do in the movement which Claudius intends 
to suppress.
<P>
[18] Acts vi, 9, where mention is made of Cyrenean and Alexandrian Jews 
among Stephen's audience.
<P>
[19] The story of Mark's apostolate at Alexandria belongs to legend, and 
the list of the first bishops of Alexandria, like that of the Roman bishops, 
was made up after the event.
<P>
[20] "What Suetonius says (<i>Claud.</i>, 25) may easily be understood in that 
sense, "Judaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantes Roma expulit," if 
we suppose that Chrestus stands for Christus and that Suetonius mistook 
the object of the agitation for the author of it. With the same event is 
connected what Dio Cassius tells (lx, 6, 6) of the measures taken by 
Claudius against the Jews in the beginning of his reign, and many connect 
with it the notice about Aquila in Acts xviii, 2; at the same time they adopt 
the year 49, indicated by Orosius (viii, 6, 15), as the date of the edict. All 
that is not equally consistent; we do not know on what Orosius' date is 
founded; the notice in Acts, an interpolation, may be a guess of the editor. 
That Claudius tried to expel all the Jews is improbable and action would 
be taken only against disturbers of the peace. If Christians were aimed at, 
the date must be much earlier than the Epistle to the Romans.
<P>
[21] It would be fourteen whole years if the figure of Galatians ii, i has 
to be <i>added</i> to the three years of i, 18. But, disregarding the suspicion which 
falls on i, 18-20, the figure in ii, i seems to indicate the time elapsed since 
the apostle's conversion, so that we ought to <i>subtract</i> from fourteen, if not 
the three years, i, 18, at least the time occupied by the journey into Arabia 
and the stay at Damascus.
<P>
[22] Text completed as indicated in note 9 above.
<P>
[23] For example, the story about the preaching at Iconium (xiv, 1-2), to 
which was probably attached what is said about the stoning of Paul (19-20) 
which the editor has transferred to Lystra.
<P>
[24] A tale invented to furnish a reason for the journey of Barnabas and 
Paul, the true object of which is given further on in xv, 1-5. Paul and 
Barnabas were together in Jerusalem only once and it was at the date 
indicated by xi, 27-30, a little before the death of Agrippa I. The prophet 
Agabus who figures here turns up in xxi, 10-11, an interpolated passage. 
Our editor was not willing that Jerusalem should have no prophets when 
there were so many at Antioch. For the same reason he represents Jude and
<P>
<center>383</center>
<P>
Silas as prophets in xv, 32. The famine of xi, 28 is taken from Josephus, 
<i>Antiquities</i>, xx, 5, 2. See <i>Les Acts des Apotres</i>, 472, 605, 785-788.
<P>
[25] We have seen above how, in the editing of Acts, a common mission 
of Barnabas and Paul to Cyprus and Lycaonia has been substituted for 
their common mission to Syria-Cilicia, the former mission being placed by 
the editor between two journeys of Barnabas and Paul to Jerusalem (Acts 
xi, 30 and xv, 1-4). Of the two journeys only one took place and at the 
date indicated for the first; thus the substituted mission hangs in air. Other 
instances of one event made into two for editorial convenience will be found 
in the book. One might almost say that it raises this kind of amplification 
to the dignity of a principle. With regard to the present case see <i>Les Actes 
des Apotres</i>, 474-476, 498-499; 571. Galatians (ii, 1-10) knows of only one 
journey of Barnabas and Paul to Jerusalem, at the date Acts assigns to the 
first journey, and with the object of the second.
<P>
[26] Acts xv, 1-2. This preamble comes from the source document and 
agrees in substance with Galatians ii, 1-11, if the two texts are correctly 
understood. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 565-566.
<P>
[27] The statement accords with the strange egotism with which, in this 
passage, Paul, or his interpreter, estimates his providential vocation.
<P>
[28] This James, brother of Jesus, is certainly intended in Galatians ii, 
12; cf. i, 19. At the time of the Jerusalem meeting the other James, brother 
of John, was still alive and is not likely to have been a dumb member of 
the assembly. The preponderance of James the Lord's brother would not 
be established till after the disappearance of the three principal disciples of 
Jesus.
<P>
[29] Note that the theory of the double apostolate is not elsewhere formulated
in the Epistle. Peter alone was the gainer by it.
<P>
[30] In Acts xv, 13-21 (discourse of James) and 28-29 (apostolic letter) 
some special observances, abstinence from blood and the flesh of strangled 
animals, regulation of marriage, are substituted for the collection mentioned 
in Galatians ii, 10. The substitution must have been deliberate, the editor 
having antedated the collection in the fiction of xi, 27-30, and belittled its 
importance.
<P>
[31] Cf. Holscher, 199, 227 n. 2.
<P>
[32] E. Meyer, iii, 420. But there is no ground to conclude with Meyer 
(after Acts xii, 25) that the delegates from Antioch were still in Jerusalem 
when James and John were executed.
<P>
[33] Acts xii, 1-2 mentions only the execution of James, but in hesitating 
language. Mark x, 39 leaves no doubt as to the martyrdom of both the 
sons of Zebedee and the text invites the conclusion that they perished 
under the same conditions. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 482-484. The 
martyrdom of John is suppressed out of regard for the Ephesian legend of 
his residence and death in Asia Minor towards the end of the first century.
<P>
[34] According to Acts xii, 25, John-Mark left Jerusalem, after Peter's 
escape, in company with Barnabas and Saul; but this because the editor 
wants John-Mark for the companion of the two missionaries on the apostolic
<P>
<center>384</center>
<P>
journey narrated in xiii—xiv (which never took place), and also to make him 
the cause of the separation between Barnabas and Paul (which was caused 
quite otherwise). As John-Mark was really at Antioch at the time of the 
separation we may believe that he had fled thither with Peter.
<P>
[35] Silas, after carrying to Antioch the letter of the Jerusalem elders, left 
with Jude (xv, 33; 34 is an interpolation co-ordinated with 40); but he 
returned to Antioch since we find him there after the quarrel ready to 
accompany Paul into Asia Minor, as John-Mark accompanies Barnabas in 
Cyprus. Agrippa's persecution caused Silas also to flee to Antioch and he, 
too, will have come there with Peter.
<P>
[36] Galatians ii, 13-14. The rating administered to Peter by Paul leads to 
nothing definite, but continues in the general discussion of justification by 
faith alone without the law. This might be counted an argument against 
the point of view which dominates this passage. It is difficult to understand 
how this point of view can have been Paul's, and no less difficult to regard 
the story of the conflict as a pure fiction.
<P>
[37] The writer of the Epistle is unwilling to confess that Paul's reprimand 
had the effect of embroiling him with Barnabas and making his further
stay in Antioch impossible.
<P>
[38] Galatians ii, 11-14 gives good ground for believing that Paul broke 
with Barnabas at the same time as with Peter and for the same reason or on 
the same pretext. The deeper motive was the growing self-importance of 
Paul; the pretext or occasion would be the accommodation which Barnabas 
and Peter wished to make with the Judaizers.
<P>
[39] Acts xii, 12. In view of the general character of the story, insistence on
this detail is out of place.
<P>
[40] 1 Peter v, 13; testimony of John the Elder in Papias. On the gratuitously
unfavourable testimony which Acts gives about John-Mark see <i>Les 
Actes des Apotres</i>, 519-522.
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER V</h2></center>
<P>
[1] The journey and the stay at Antioch mentioned in Acts xviii, 22 in 
all probability never took place. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 706-710.
<P>
[2] As the first "we" in the edited version of Acts appears in the narrative 
of the stay at Troas (xvi, 10), commentators have been prompt to assume 
that Luke first joined Paul at this place; but some critics have supposed 
that he was the Macedonian of the dream who, according to our story, 
decided Paul to pass into Macedonia. But, if we are to determine the participation
of Luke in the comings and goings of Paul and other events by the 
alternations of "we" with impersonal forms of speech, we must assume 
that the editor of Acts has made no cuttings in Luke's narrative, suppressed 
nothing and interpolated no fictitious incidents and discourses. Now it is 
certain that he has done all three. The text rather invites us to think that
<P>
<center>385</center>
<P>
he who says "we" in the Troas story had been with Paul all along. There is 
no risk in supposing that from their starting point at Antioch he followed 
Paul in his haphazard journeyings, the painful stages of which are described 
in terms strongly suggestive of an eye-witness. The tradition which makes 
Luke a Christian of Antioch may well proceed from explicit testimony of 
the primitive book before the editor got to work on it, and is confirmed 
by the fact that the original author seems well informed about Antioch 
affairs and to have understood the birth of Christianity from his Antioch 
point of view. Cf. <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 627-631.
<P>
[3] Acts xvi, i is vaguely completed by xiv, 20-21.
<P>
[4] Cf. Colossians i, 1; iv, 10-11. 2 Timothy i, 5 knows both Timothy's 
mother and grandmother—information which the cautious critic finds 
rather too complete. In Acts xxi, 20-26 the nazirate of Paul is alleged as 
the reason for Timothy's circumcision. But Paul, when playing his part as 
a Jew, could practise any Jewish observance demanded by the occasion; it 
was not to please the Jews that he took the vows of a <i>nazir</i>, as we shall 
see later on. It is hardly credible that any pagan was ever circumcized by 
Paul merely to please the Jews.
<P>
[5] At Iconium, as well as at Antioch of Pisidia, we may to some extent 
supplement the vague indication of Acts xvi, 4-5 by xiv, 1-3, 19, 20, and 
xiii, 14, 43, 50-51—employed with discernment.
<P>
[6] Pressing hard on the text of Acts we might infer that the missionaries 
merely traversed the country without preaching in it. This is the interpretation
of the text given, perhaps without warrant, by those who construe the 
Epistle as addressed to the communities of Lycaonia-Pisidia which belonged 
to the Roman province called Galatia, but were not Galatian country. The 
problem of the destination of the Epistle, on which critics are divided, 
would be non-existent if Paul, in the course of one and the same mission, 
founded the communities of Lycaonia and Pisidia, and then some others in 
Phrygia and Galatia proper, without going as far as Ancyra and Pessinonte, 
the Epistle to the Galatians being finally addressed to the whole of these 
communities.
<P>
[7] The Epistle presupposes this, and the little we know about the preaching
at Iconium and Antioch of Pisidia does not contradict it.
<P>
[8] Acts xvi, 9-10. The "we" appears in this passage which must have been 
taken without alteration from the source document; 6-8 may be regarded 
as a highly compressed summary. There is no reason to suppose that Luke 
was the Macedonian, nor that he came from Philippi.
<P>
[9] Acts xvi, 22, 39-40. The edited version makes Paul's captivity last 
for one night marked by various prodigies, in sequence to which Paul, 
after getting the town magistrate to exculpate him as a Roman citizen, is 
said to have been set free. The earthquake and its consequences are conceived
on this pattern of a theme common in religious legend (cf. Euripides, 
<i>Bacchae</i>, 436-441, 502-503, 606-628). There is a contradiction between the 
proud attitude of Paul, the humble demeanour of the magistrates, and the 
order to quit the place without delay. The claim to be a Roman citizen is
<P>
<center>386</center>
<P>
borrowed from Paul's trial at Jerusalem and repeated. Paul was liberated
without much delay, but probably by the intervention of his friends and 
on their bail—a trait seemingly transposed to the story that follows (xvii, 9)—on
condition of his immediate departure.
<P>
[10] A story cut down and changed like the one preceding. The beginning 
of it comes from the source document, but the riot which drives the missionaries
out of the town takes place the moment after their arrival and 
too soon, as it did at Philippi, this time, however, provoked by Jews, as 
the former was by pagans. 1 Thessalonians making no reference to any 
occurrence of this kind, there is reason to suspect that our editor has 
balanced the pagan riot which put an end to Paul's ministry at Philippi by a 
similar charge against the Jews of Thessalonica.
<P>
[11] Acts xvii, 10-12. The notice about Berea seems to have a fictitious 
conclusion (13—14), which repeats what has been said about Thessalonica. 
The indications about Silas and Timothy (15) must have been changed by 
the editor; they are not in agreement with 1 Thessalonians iii, 1-2, nor 
even with Acts xviii, 5.
<P>
[12] To be inferred from 1 Thessalonians iii, 1-2.
<P>
[13] In like manner the discourse in the synagogue at Antioch of Pisidia 
(xiii, 16-40) is a specimen of the teaching given to a Jewish audience, 
and the discourse to the elders of Ephesus (xx, 10-35) a specimen of
instructions to the heads of congregations.
<P>
[14] xvii, 28. The line, "for in him we live and move and have our being," 
is also borrowed from the poem of Epimenides, entitled <i>Minos</i>, in which 
we also find the saying about the Cretans in Titus i, 12. (Rendel Harris, 
<i>St. Paul and Greek Literature, Woodbrooke Essays</i>, 7, p. 7.)
<P>
[15] Though Paul did not think that Athens might be altogether neglected, 
we should misconstrue his mind and the mind of the first Christian generation 
by concluding with E. Meyer (iii, 328-9) that Athens was the chief aim of 
the mission, in respect of which the preachings in the Macedonian towns 
was no more than rapidly completed preparation, Paul's main purpose 
being to overthrow hellenic philosophy on the ground where it was most 
at home. The editor of Acts seems to have had some such notion; but to 
accept the famous discourse and its <i>mise en scene</i> as authentic would be 
placing too much confidence in his fictions.
<P>
[16] 1 Thessalonians iii, 1-2, 5-7 shows that Paul was afraid the group of 
Christians would not hold together after his departure; he avows his misgivings
after being reassured by the good news which Silas and Timothy 
brought to him at Corinth.
<P>
[17] Acts xviii, i, 2, 3. His mission in Asia Minor seems to have been 
carried through in difficult material conditions. Later on Paul accepted help 
from Philippi. But on arriving at Corinth it would seem that he had to 
work for his living. It is possible also that his mishap at Athens induced 
him to test the ground before beginning his propaganda in the atmosphere 
of Corinth. In xviii, 2 the reference to the edict of Claudius is a later addition. 
<P>
[18] Cf. Philippians iv, 15-16, which shows that the Philippians helped
<P>
<center>387</center>
<P>
Paul in his mission at Thessalonica. It is a doubtful point whether Lydia 
is expressly indicated, and as Paul's wife, in iv, 3, though it has been maintained
by some from ancient time.
<P>
[19] The story of the Corinthian mission, like the others, is mutilated and 
incoherent. Besides the addition in xviii, 2 (indicated in note 17), 4 should 
be placed after 7 and 7 attached to the beginning of 5, reading: "But, when 
Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul took up his preaching." 
It is then that he leaves Aquila's house and begins to preach in the synagogue. 
What is said in verse 6 about his quarrel with the Jews is an addition 
repeating the stereotyped procedure that everywhere Paul addressed himself 
to the pagans only after being rejected by the Jews. Paul's difficulties began 
after the conversion of Crispus and the others (8); between 8 and 9 there 
is a gap; then mention should have been made of the difficulties which no 
doubt compelled Paul to leave the synagogue; the vision of 9 will then 
encourage him to go on with his preaching in spite of everything; but there 
is another gap, either before or after 11, for we expect an account of the 
results of his ministry and get only an indication of its length.
<P>
[20] To these eighteen months we must add the time spent by Paul in 
Aquila's house while he waited for his auxiliaries. No account need be taken 
of the "many days" of verse 18, which is only a bit of stitching to make a 
forced connexion between the mention of Paul's departure and the Gallio 
incident.
<P>
[21] See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 698-699.
<P>
[22] See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 508-518.
<P>
[23] Acts xviii, 18-23 is a badly constructed and largely fictitious story, 
indicating Syria (18) as the goal of the journey, because the editor—repeating
the devices he employed on the journey of Barnabas and Paul to 
Jerusalem at the rime of the Antioch mission—cut the last approach of 
Paul to the mother-community into two; the vow mentioned in the same 
passage (18) belongs to the last journey and we shall meet it later on. The 
visit of Paul to the synagogue at Ephesus is wrongly timed; like the journey 
to Jerusalem and to Syria it is intended to disguise the true motive which 
determined Paul to visit the communities he had recently founded in Galatia 
and Phrygia. Of set purpose the editor ignores Paul's conflicts with the 
Judaizing Christians, just as he will know nothing of the difficulties Paul 
had just encountered at Corinth, in which Apollos had been involved. See 
<i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 703-710.
<P>
[24] Acts xviii, 24-28. An incoherent and touched-up story. The restriction 
(25), "knowing only the baptism of John," taken rigorously, contradicts 
the preceding statement, "he gave exact teaching about Jesus." The restriction
goes with the kind of catechizing which Aquila and Priscilla are 
supposed to give Apollos (26). The end of the story (28), in which the 
preaching of Apollos is made to consist of a prolonged refutation of the 
Jews, throws a veil over the voluntary or involuntary part played by Apollos 
in the divisions at Corinth, just as what precedes is to minimize his part 
at Ephesus. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 710-717.
<P>
<center>388</center>
<P>
[25] Acts xix, 1-7. The story hangs together better than that of Apollos, 
doubtless because the editor has put more of his own into the latter. See
<i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 717—723.
<P>
[26] Acts viii, 14-17. Here fiction keeps to ground level and the story may 
serve to throw light on that of Apollos and of the twelve disciples. See 
<i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 368—370.
<P>
[27] Cf. 2 Corinthians iii, i, where some contempt is shown for such 
letters which were in common use and one would think necessary.
<P>
[28] Acts xix, 8-10 is a summary of the authentic story in the source 
document from which the editor has cut out, as he does elsewhere, the 
details of Paul's success and the difficulties he encountered. To make up 
for this he credits Paul with a parcel of miracles which form a worthy 
pendant to those operated by the shadow of Peter (v, 15-16), also an 
invention of his own. The misadventure of the Jewish exorcist has the look 
of being a borrowed story adapted to the history of Paul in order to bring 
in somehow the edifying example given by the believers of Ephesus in 
burning the sorcerers' books in sequence to the former incident (18-20), 
See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 752—753, 756.
<P>
[29] In 1 Corinthians xv, 32 there is an allusion to fighting with beasts at 
Ephesus, a passage whose meaning has been much discussed and the 
authenticity open to discussion; in xvi, 8-9 there is mention of effectual 
ministry in the city, but "many adversaries." The riot described in Acts 
xix, 23—41 fills the place of all the difficulties and setbacks Paul had to meet 
at Ephesus. The passage which mentions companions of Paul (29b—3i) 
and the allusion to companions in the speech of its local magistrate (37) 
having the look of surcharges, and the whole story having no real attachment 
to Paul's Ephesian ministry, the not improbable supposition has been made 
that the editor of Acts found some story of an anti-Jewish riot at Ephesus 
and converted it into a riot against Paul. (Hypothesis of Wellhausen, taken 
up in <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 752-753, 756.)
<P>
[30] Acts xix, 21-22, taking account of the fact that the editor deliberately
omits everything that relates to the collection for the saints at
Jerusalem.
<P>
[31] The editor has neutralized the significance of the collection by saying 
nothing about it in the situations where it played a part and by representing 
it as a kind of symbolic act in the fictitious story where the prophet Agabus 
comes in (Acts xi, 27—30). See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 471—475.
<P>
[32] E. Meyer, iii, 451, would infer from 1 Corinthians i, 12; iii, 21, where 
Cephas is mentioned along with Paul, that Peter also came to Corinth at 
this time. But we may conclude with as much probability from iii, 4-9 
and iv, 6 that Apollos only followed Paul to Corinth, Peter's name being 
merely invoked against Paul by some of his opponents. But it remains a 
possibility which we may regard as little probable.
<P>
[33] In this passage Paul, recalling his promise, seems anxious to keep it.
<P>
[34] Acts xix, 21-22. This connects with 1 Corinthians iv, 17; xvi, 1-11 
where, before announcing the coming of Timothy, he says that the col-
<P>
<center>389</center>
<P>
lection in Macedonia and Corinth is to be carried out on the lines he had
laid down for Galatia.
<P>
[35] Notwithstanding the somewhat cold reception Corinth had given 
him he had promised to return before long; later he concluded he must 
wait until tempers there had cooled down. Hence no doubt came the 
accusation of fickleness to which he replies in 2 Corinthians i, 15-20; ii, 4.
<P>
[36] There seems no reason to identify this person with the incestuous 
man of 1 Corinthians v, 1-5, though some critics do so.
<P>
[37] 2 Corinthians i, 8-11, to which ii, 6 corresponds, seems to reflect 
such a state of mind, rather than the fear of some external danger in 
which Paul might have lost his life; for example, the riot described 
in Acts xix, 23-40 (so E. Meyer, iii, 12), in which Paul ran no danger, 
supposing it ever took place.
<P>
[38] 2 Corinthians ii, 3-4; vii, 8-12. It is this sad and severe letter which 
many have thought reproduced, at least in part, in 2 Corinthians x—xiii, 
where, rather, some fragments of it are preserved.
<P>
[39] The role of Titus may be deduced from 2 Corinthians ii, 11—13;
vii, 6-7; viii, 6, 16—17, 23, on which xii, 18 has editorial dependence. We 
do not know how Titus arrived in Asia at Paul's side in the nick of time to 
save the situation, nor how, his mission done, he disappeared from Paul's 
company.
<P>
[40] According to 2 Corinthians xiii, 1 this was the third stay made by 
Paul in the city; the first, that of his mission, being much the longest;
the second, certainly a short one, was that when he was checked and unable 
to restore order in the community; the third preceded his departure for 
Jerusalem and probably represents the three months which, according to 
Acts xx, 2-3, Paul spent "in Hellas," the editor being extremely cautious 
in dealing with the relations between Paul and Corinth at that time.
<P>
[41] This chronology is somewhat wavering. Retaining the coincidence 
with Gallio's proconsulates Paul's mission to Corinth would be completed 
in 51 or 52, the apostle arriving at Corinth in 49 or 50, and the missions tp
Asia Minor and Macedonia filling the years 44-49. The mission to Ephesus 
cannot have been begun before 52 or 53 and ended towards 55 or 56, and 
Paul would then not leave Corinth for good before the spring of 56 or 57. 
E. Meyer (iii, 447) puts this final departure in 59; but he does this in order 
that he may place the death of Paul, with that of Peter, in 64, during Nero's 
persecution.
<P>
[42] Cf. Romans xv, 26-27; xvi, 1.
<P>
[43] In Acts xx, 4 Gaius is said to be "of Derbe." But the original list 
may have been worked over and this Gaius may be the Corinthian (mentioned
in Romans xvi, 23) charged to bring the collection from Achaia. 
See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 759-762.
<P>
[44] The vow is antedated in xviii, 18, where the text has been retouched 
by the editor (see <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 704-705). This verse should be 
attached to xx, 16 and xxi, 23—26 as referring to the same vow. The matter 
in question is that of a temporary <i>nazirate</i> and a vow taken with special
<P>
<center>390</center>
<P>
reference to a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The head was not shaved again 
while the vow was in force, but only on discharge from it as one of the 
sacrifices prescribed by the Law. The vow is antedated in the story of the 
fictitious journey which the editor has duplicated from the account before 
us. For the ordinary conditions of such vows see <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>,
796-798.
<P>
[45] Acts xx, 5—6. The account of the sea passage is clumsily attached to 
the list of Paul's companions, and the "we" of the source document 
suddenly reappears because the editor has here picked up the thread of the 
original. As we know from the Epistles that Luke was not with Paul at 
Athens nor in the missions that followed, we may conclude that he remained
at Philippi.
<P>
[46] The miracle of raising Eutychus from the dead which Paul is said to 
have performed at Troas is on the Old Testament model, like the raising
of Dorcas by Peter (ix, 36-43).
<P>
[47] The editor of Acts, who says not a word about the collection, takes 
advantage of the stay at Miletus to lodge in this place an allocution by Paul 
to the elders of Ephesus on the model of a pastoral discourse to the ministers 
of the flock. It will be noted that the editor, whose intention is to say 
nothing about Paul's death, is careful to make Paul predict it (25) as a 
consequence of the journey he has undertaken.
<P>
[48] The account of the meeting with the brethren at Tyre has, to say the 
least, received additions, the prophetic warning given by the brethren 
having a compromising likeness to what Paul himself has just said at Miletus. 
The seven days at Troas, the seven days at Tyre and, later on, the seven 
days at Puteoli (xxviii, 14) have more the look of edifying parentheses
than real memoranda.
<P>
[49] The conclusion of the incident (xxi, 12-14) must be nearly identical 
with what Luke made to follow a prediction by Philip's prophetic daughters.
<P>
[50] Acts xxi, 15-16. Before the visit to James our author clumsily places 
a favourable reception by the brethren in general. The source document, 
on the contrary, represents the hospitality of Mnason as a kind of precaution 
against too hasty contact with the body of Judaizing Christians.
<P>
[51] According to Josephus (<i>Antiquities</i>, xix, 6, 1) Agrippa I, anxious to 
make a show of religion, released a number of poor <i>nazirs</i> from their vows, 
by paying their expenses for the various sacrifices required of them by
the Mosaic Law (see Numbers vi).
<P>
[52] Acts xxi, 20-26. The discourse of the elders is intelligible and holds 
well together except for the perceptible gloss, after the words "thou seest, 
brother, how many thousands of Jews there are," which adds the explanation 
"of those who believe." Verse 22 is an artificial transition intended to 
make some sort of connexion between what has just been said about the 
disposition of believing Jews and the advice about to be given to Paul 
to prove his zeal for the Law before these same Jews by taking(?) a vow. 
The lame reference to the pseudo-apostolic decree (xv, 9) is in keeping 
with the false perspective.
<P>
<center>391</center>
<P>
[53] From xxi, 27 it would seem that the editor thought the nazirate lasted 
seven days. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 805.
<P>
[54] The brethren mentioned in xxi, 23 had certainly been under the vow 
for some time.
<P>
[55] In the editor's thesis, all the groups of nascent Christianity, Jewish 
and hellenist, keep the Law, the Jewish with the rigour of the Mosaic 
code, the hellenist in conformity with the prohibitions supposed to apply 
to all the children of Noah, and not only to the descendants of Abraham. 
See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 804-807.
<P>
[56] Except on this supposition the sequence of the affair is not intelligible.
<P>
[57] There may be an echo of the source document in xxiii, 11. But the 
vision is more likely to have taken place on the night following Paul's 
arrest. It reveals the working of Paul's mind which suddenly led him to 
see that he might carry his message to Rome under Roman authority. 
See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 835-837.
<P>
[58] The transfer of Paul to Caesarea must have followed very soon 
after his arrest, but the editor has deliberately thrown the circumstances 
into confusion. It is certain that the Jewish authorities would not lose a 
moment in putting forth every possible effort to get their hands on the man 
whom the intervention of the Roman soldiers had saved from the fury of 
their people. If they thought it likely that the charge of profaning the temple 
would fail they could still claim Paul as a religious agitator whose revolutionary
activities they had the right to suppress, especially at Jerusalem. 
But the tribune could not hand over to them a Roman citizen whose right 
to be judged only in a Roman court was incontestable. Accordingly he 
would at once refer the case to the procurator.
<P>
[59] The resumption of the story is as easy to recognize as the interpolation 
which breaks it up. In xxii, 23—24 we find ourselves back at the exact point 
where we stand in xxi, 34-35.
<P>
[60] Acts xxii, 25-29. The scene is dramatized by the editor on much 
the same lines as his fiction of the scourging of Paul at Philippi (xvi, 35-39), 
which it recalls rather too vividly.
<P>
[61] xxii, 30-xxiii, 10. The editor is plainly in error in making Ananias 
high priest in office at the time of Paul's trial. High priest in 47, he was 
deposed before 52.
<P>
[62] For a discussion of this and the other fictions at this point, in which 
the naive audacity of the editor is indulged as freely as in die story of the 
sitting of the Sanhedrim, see <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 838-842.
<P>
[63] xxiii, 23-30. Having invented a Jewish plot against Paul our editor 
has now to mobilize hundreds of soldiers to escort Paul to Caesarea, but 
the mention of the departure by night and the halt at Antipatris may come 
from the source document. The report of the tribune Lysias is no less an 
invention than the sitting of the Sanhedrim, of which it gives an account to 
Felix.
<P>
[64] xxiii, 31-35. The declaration of Felix to Paul (33), "I will hear thee 
when thy accusers are come," has no sense unless Paul himself invoked the
<P>
<center>392</center>
<P>
jurisdiction of the procurator in order to avoid falling into the hands of the
Sanhedrim which claimed him.
<P>
[65] xxiv, 22-23. Two motives are alleged for the adjournment: the first, 
Felix knew in advance what line to take in regard to the Christian propaganda—this
must come from the source document; second, that Felix wished to 
await the coming of Lysias—a pretext invented by the editor.
<P>
[66] xxiv, 27. The editor has thought he might add that, since Felix did 
not release Paul before giving up office, it was to please the Jews. The fact 
is that Felix left Paul's case just where it was when he was relieved of office;
but during the two years of its adjournment it is quite possible that an 
understanding, more or less tacit, was formed between the procurator and 
the Sanhedrim to let the matter sleep. The Jewish authority could not 
have much ground for complaint so long as Paul was held prisoner and 
the official adjournment would seem a denial of the right Paul had claimed. 
For the discussion of the passage, see <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 867-870.
<P>
[67] xxiv, 22. See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 862—863.
<P>
[68] Aged six at the death of her father in 44, Drusilla was married in 52 
to the king of Emesa, Aziz, who had himself circumcised to obtain her 
hand; but their union was short-lived, for the procurator Felix fell in love 
with her at sight and succeeded in detaching her from her husband through 
the good offices of a friend of his, a Jewish sorcerer from Cyprus, while 
Drusilla made no scruple about marrying the uncircumcised Roman in her 
eagerness to escape from the jealousy of Berenice, her elder sister by ten 
years, who envied Drusilla her greater beauty (Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, xx, 
7, 1-2). Of Felix, Tacitus writes as follows: "Per omnem saevitiam et 
libidinem jus regium servili ingenio exercuit."
<P>
[69] xxv, 9. The editor pretends that Festus wishes to repeat at Jerusalem 
the proceeding previously attributed to the tribune Lysias, tliat of assembling 
the Sanhedrim for a fuller inquiry, taking its verdict as to the guilt or innocence
of the accused and getting from it a sentence which it would then 
be his business, as a Roman magistrate, to ratify.
<P>
[70] According to the editor's point of view, Festus understood all along 
that the whole affair was concerned with beliefs debated among the Jews;
but the procurator, faced by the demand of the Sanhedrim, is supposed 
unable to refuse it, just as he will be unable to refuse ratification of its 
sentence, if Paul elects to be tried at Jerusalem. The case is presented in
the same way as the trial of Jesus in the Gospels.
<P>
[71] The silly remark here attributed to the procurator is intended to 
corroborate the certificate of innocence he has just given to Paul in assuring 
Agrippa that Paul's activities in the affair were concerned only "with a 
certain Jesus, a dead man, whom Paul declared to be alive."
<P>
[72] After all, then, the examination before Agrippa provides Festus with 
nothing to put into his report to Caesar!
<P>
[73] "We" makes a new appearance when the sea story begins (xxvii, 1) 
after being in eclipse since the arrival at Jerusalem. The eclipse is partly 
explained by the mutilations and substitutions in the intermediate stories.
<P>
<center>393</center>
<P>
[74] The only one mentioned is Aristarchus of Thessalonica; but Timothy 
must also have been among them.
<P>
[75] The story of the sea passage has been changed only by interpolations, 
easily discernible, aimed at giving greater importance to Paul's role in 
this part of the story. Examples are the following: Paul's prophetic but 
rejected advice to winter in Crete rather than in the place called Fair Haven;
reminder of this advice and announcement, in the midst of the tempest, 
that no lives would be lost; probably also the intervention of Paul to 
denounce the sailors about to desert the ship and its passengers, and the 
exhortation to take food (30-38). On the substantial authenticity of the 
story of the tempest, which has been questioned, see <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 
921-922.
<P>
[76] The miracle of the harmless viper and its conclusion (3-6) remind 
us a little too closely of the adventure at Lystra (xiv, 8—18) in the invented 
story of the mission which Paul and Barnabas are said to have made into 
Asia Minor. The marvellous cures performed by Paul are apparently introduced
to provide a filling for the three months spent at Malta.
<P>
[77] From xxviii, 16, which contains the last "we," the source document 
must have run on to the indication in verse 30 of the two years spent by 
Paul in the condition known as <i>custodia libera</i>.
<P>
[78] xxviii, 31. Paul devoted himself to preaching the Gospel in his own 
house, but it was not for the purpose of enabling him to do so that the 
relative liberty of which he took advantage was granted him.
<P>
[79] xxviii, 22-23a. But how could the Jews of Rome at this date (62) 
have said to Paul that they knew of Christianity only by hearing of it as a 
sect that was spoken against?
<P>
[80] xxviii, 25b-27. The quotation from Isaiah is found again in Mark iv, 2 
(Matthew xiii, 14-15; Luke viii, 10); John xii, 39-40.
<P>
[81] There is no reference to this project outside the Epistle to the Romans 
(xv, 24), and it would seem that Paul had renounced it even before the end 
of his Roman captivity. But legend has not allowed the reference to it in 
Romans to fall into oblivion. In any case 2 Timothy iv, 16 can be understood
as a first trial at which Paul was acquitted.
<P>
[82] Romans xv, 19, 23-24. Paul seems to have regarded Spain as the 
limit of the Western world. Circumstances may have led him to consider 
it impossible to reach this limit, or simply to think no more about it.
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER VI</h2></center>
<P>
[1] "Exitiabilis superstitio" is to be reckoned among the "atrocia aut 
pudenda" which flowed into Rome from all sides. Suetonius, without 
connecting the persecution of the Christians with the burning of Rome, 
writes to the same effect (<i>Nero</i>, 16): "Afflicti suppliciis Christiani, genus 
honunum superstitionis novae et maleficae." The secrecy of the Christian
<P>
<center>394</center>
<P>
meetings furnished a pretext for the imputation of infamous crimes; but 
similar imputations had previously been brought against the Jews.
<P>
[2] Tacitus writes: "Igitur primum correpti qui fatebantur." The object 
of <i>fatebantur</i> has to be established from the context. The first reference is to 
the <i>exitiabilis superstitio</i> of which <i>Christus</i> is the author and the next to the 
multitude condemned rather for <i>odium generis humani</i>. E. Meyer (iii, 507) 
says that Tacitus expressly avoided being more precise because his object 
was to show how the prosecution of incendiaries developed, in course of 
the pursuit, into the prosecution of Christians in general. In reality the 
first Christians laid hold of were arrested as incendiaries, and those hunted 
down afterwards were arrested as Christians, without the establishment of 
any judicial distinction between the two categories. Nevertheless the text 
of Tacitus can only be understood naturally as meaning a confession of 
incendiarism by the first of the accused. But, in view of the multitude 
denounced, we have still to ask what these first confessions were worth. 
Reitzenstein, <i>Die hellenistischen Mysterienreligionen</i>, iii, 122, maintains 
with some probability that the inquisition was carried out by Nero's police 
in the interests of the emperor and that the first to be arrested were no 
other than the spies employed by the police for the occasion, as happened 
in the trial of Octavia, when a pretended accomplice appeared to confess 
to adultery which had not been committed.
<P>
[3] A point perfectly treated by Renan, <i>L'Antichrist</i>, 154-155.
<P>
[4] Clement's evocation of the Roman martyrs comes as conclusion to a 
long discourse on the evil deeds, discord and jealousy recorded in the Old 
Testament from Cain to David. The author then comes to "examples of 
our generation"—to be understood as meaning the Christian age, not in 
the chronological sense of his contemporaries—and takes the apostles to 
begin with: <font face="Symbol">Petron, dV dia zhlon adikon ouc ena oude duo, alla pleionaV

is the <i>multitudo ingens</i> of Tacitus; but we cannot be sure that the two 
apostles and the crowd perished on the same occasion. We have here a 
retrospective view of the Roman martyrs at the time of Nero. Cf. H. 
Lietzmann, <i>Petrus und Paulus in Rome</i>, 228-236.
<P>
[5] Cf. Acts xii, 17. We have seen above why the editor of Acts omits to 
mention the locality to which Peter fled.
<P>
[6] Account should be taken, however, of what has been said above 
under the Epistle to the Philippians. Peter may have been at Rome among 
those of whom Paul complains that they were preaching a Gospel more or 
less opposed to his. The fact is that the editor of Acts, who has brought the 
entire Roman community to pay sympathetic homage to Paul, would have 
been in no mind to call attention, even if he knew of them, to the divisions,
<P>
<center>395</center>
<P>
factions and contrary currents which might exist among the Roman 
brethren in Nero's time. At all events it is risky to suppose with E. Meyer 
(iii, 508) that the "jealousy and discord," of which Clement speaks in 
connexion with Peter and Paul, may be interpreted as playing a part in the 
denunciation of Christians mutually hostile. The only precise detail known 
in regard to the mass of the victims concerns denunciation by pagan relatives. 
As to the apostles, their denunciation may well have been the work of non-Christians,
without any need to make the Jews responsible.
<P>
[7] Romans, 4. <font face="Symbol">ouc wV petroV kai pauloV diatassomai umin</font>. This puts 
the letter of Ignatius on the same level as Clement and Dionysius.
<P>
[8] In Eusebius, <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> ii, 25. Writing to the Romans, 
Dionysius said that the communities of Corinth and Rome were both taught 
by Peter and Paul who were equally together in martyrdom at Rome. 
A legendary and uncritical view of primitive history.
<P>
[9] 1 Peter v, 13. Mark is mentioned in this passage; also Sylvanus (12). 
We have seen that Colossians iv, 10 and Philemon 24 suppose Mark at 
Rome, but as one of Paul's followers, while John the Elder (in Papias) 
makes him the interpreter of Peter. All of which is uncertain enough.
<P>
[10] John xx, 18-19 (a plain hint in xiii, 36). Martyrdom is clearly implied, 
and apparently by crucifixion, without indication of place. But, considering 
the late age of the testimony, we may believe that the author had Rome 
in mind. See <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 524-525.
<P>
[11] Lietzmann, 274, concludes for the authenticity of the burial places 
traditionally assigned to Peter and Paul.
<P>
[12] Eusebius, iii, 5, 3, names Pella, beyond the Jordan, as the first place at 
which they stayed. It is noteworthy that the Judaizing Christians of those 
regions kept the name "Nazoreans."
<P>
[23] Meyer, iii, 517, 554 (on the strength of Dio Cassius, 67, 14), thinks he 
was a Jew. But the Christian inscriptions, older than the legends Meyer sets 
aside, have to be reckoned with.
<P>
[24] In all probability the <i>sacramentum</i> in question was the oath taken at 
baptism.
<P>
[15] "Affirmabant autem hanc fuisse summam vel culpae suae vel erroris, 
quod essent soliti stato die ante lucem convenire carmenque Christo quasi 
deo dicere secum invicem, seque sacramento non in scelus aliquod obstringere,
sed ne furta, ne latrocinia, ne adulteria committerent, ne fidem 
fallerent, ne depositum appellati abnegarent."
<P>
[16] "Nec mediocriter haesitavi: I Sitne aliquod discrimen aetatum, an 
quamlibet teneri nihil a robusrioribus differant; II Detur poenitentiae venia, 
an ei, qui omnino Christianus fuit, desisse non prosit; III Nomen ipsum, 
si flagitiis careat, an flagitia cohaerentia nomini puniantur."
<P>
[17] Eusebius, iv, 26 (the text quoted in iv, 13 is apocryphal).
<P>
[18] Romans xiii, 1-7. A piece of padding, but introduced with a 
purpose.
<P>
[19] This Quadratus may be the same as the person mentioned by Eusebius 
in iii, 37 and v, 17. As those raised from the dead are associated with those

<P>
cured of disease perhaps we should see in the multiplication of both classes 
a mere rhetorical flourish.
<P>
[20] Eusebius is mistaken in making the apology addressed to Hadrian. 
It has only recently been recovered and reconstructed. See R. Harris and 
A. Robinson, <i>The Apology of Aristides</i>, 1891, and Harnack, <i>Chronologie</i>, i, 
271-273.
<P>
[21] Cf. Colossians ii, 16-19; Acts vii, 53 (Galatians iii, 19).
<P>
[22] In the <i>Dialogue</i>, 2-3, Justin himself, not, perhaps, without literary 
artifice, recounts the stages of his religious experience.
<P>
[23] Observe that Justin here encounters Celsus, who was acquainted with 
the Great Church, but views Christianity as a medley of sects affecting the 
same name for ever quarrelling and reproaching each other with unmentionable
crimes. Origen, <i>Contra Celsum</i>, iii, 12 and v, 63.
<P>
[24] Justin here follows the doctrine of the Book of Enoch on the fallen 
angels.
<P>
[25] 1 Apology, 6. The mention of the prophetic spirit after the angels is 
possibly an interpolation. See Tumiel, <i>Histoire des dogmes</i> (1932), 168—170.
<P>
[26] Justin's imagination seems to have been occupied with a dedicatory 
inscription to the ancient divinity Semo Sanctus. But did he find out for 
himself that Simon came to Rome in the time of Claudius?
<P>
[27] 1 <i>Apology</i>, 26, 58. In the latter passage Justin says of Marcion: "He 
is still teaching.... Many, accepting his doctrine as the only true, make a 
mock of us."
<P>
[28] 1 <i>Apology</i>, 35, 48. The supposition has been made by some that Justin 
had in mind the apocryphal Acts of Pilate and that he knew them. But 
he speaks of official and authentic Acts, which he has not seen. The references 
to the registers of Quirinius and to the Acts of Pilate are conceived in 
identical terms.
<P>
[29] 2 <i>Apology</i>, 5-7. Here again Justin reproduces the Book of Enoch on 
the fallen angels and the bad demons.
<P>
[30] Cf. Rougier, <i>Celse</i>, 361-429.
<P>
[31] An authentic and contemporary account of them is contained in the 
letter which the Lyonnaise community addressed for the purpose to the 
communities of Asia and Phrygia. A copy of it was carried, with letters 
of the martyrs concerning the Phrygian prophets (Montanism), to the 
bishop of Rome by the priest Irenaeus. The story of the martyrdoms is 
reproduced in part in Eusebius, v, 1-4.
<P>
[32] We do not know whether Pothinus also came from Asia, but the 
fact that the account of the trials undergone at Lyons is addressed to the 
communities of Asia and Phrygia points in that direction.
<P>
[33] It was thus in all the persecutions, except that the accused in 64 do 
not seem to have been given the choice between death and apostasy.
<P>
[34] The manner in which they are characterized in the letter (Eusebius, 
v, 1, 48) merits attention: "Those who never had a trace of faith, nor any 
feeling of the new marriage garment (Matthew xxii, 11-13), nor thought of 
the fear of God, but who by turning back brought the Way into contempt."
<P>
<center>397</center>
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER VII</h2></center>
<P>
[1] The Aramean formula is retained in 1 Corinthians xvi, 22. Revelation 
xxii, 20 echoes it in a translation. <i>Mar, marana</i> is the Aramean equivalent 
of <font face="Symbol">kurioV</font>. This may be a title of honour and a term of politeness. In 
Christian usage it was a messianic title, a cult name giving divine attribute 
to its object.
<P>
[2] On the meaning and consequences of this see throughout Bousset, 
<i>Kyrios Christos</i>.
<P>
[3] <i>Maranatha</i> still appears in the Liturgy of the <i>Didache</i>. <i>Abba</i> (Father) 
came at some time into Christian usage (Mark xiv, 36; Romans viii, 45;
Galatians iv, 6). It still retains <i>Amen</i>.
<P>
[4] Because, in synagogal reading, the divine name Adonai, "Lord," was 
usually read in place of Jahveh, which it was forbidden to pronounce.
<P>
[5] The whole chapter forms part of an instruction on the use of the 
flesh of animals sacrificed to idols. The position assigned to Jesus is that 
of a cult-lord, but the only true Lord in that category.
<P>
[6] Psalm ii, 7, quoted in Acts xiii, 32-33, where it is the equivalent of 
Psalm cx, 1 in the argument of Acts ii, 34-36.
<P>
[7] A strange feature is borrowed from the mystery religions in Revelation 
xix, 16: the title "King of Kings and Lord of Lords" is not only written 
on the mantle of the Christ but also tattooed on his thigh.
<P>
[8] Fragment of the Gospel of the Hebrews quoted by Jerome, <i>De viris</i>, 2.
<P>
[9] Certain cosmogonies, the Babylonian in the first instance, naturally 
place the creation of the world in the spring, creation being the myth of 
the new year.
<P>
[10] 1 <i>Apology</i>, 67, 7. The concluding remark about the instructions given 
by the risen Christ remind us less of Luke xxiv, 44-49 and Acts i, 2 than 
of the Apocalypse of Peter and of some of the gnostic gospels.
<P>
[11] Under these conditions it seems impossible to maintain that the
Sunday Easter was only introduced at Rome in the time of Anicetus, 
otherwise we should have to place the editing of the Gospels after that 
date (157-168).
<P>
[12] See Dolger, <i>Sol salutis</i>, 98 ff. Evidence in Tertullian, <i>Apologeticum</i>, 
16, 9 and in Clement of Alexandria, <i>Stromata</i>, vii, 7, this last inspired by 
2 Corinthians iv, 6, where the symbolism is almost Justin's.
<P>
[13] Cf. Hebrews vi, 4; x, 32. In 2 Corinthians iv, 4, 6 the <font face="Symbol">fwtismoV</font> may 
well refer to baptismal initiation.
<P>
[14] Mark i, 8, lo; Matthew iii, 11, 16; Luke iii, 16, 22; John i, 31, 34;
Acts i, 5.
<P>
[15] R. Reitzenstein, <i>Die Vorgeschlchte der Christlichen Taufe</i>, would make 
Christian baptism depend on the baptism of the Mandeans. There may be a 
relationship between the two, but the alleged dependence is quite unproved, 
seeing that the Mandean sect is much later than the birth of Christianity. 
The only sacrament of the Mandeans was a repeated baptism which should
<P>
<center>398</center>
<P>
be compared, in its repeatable character, with that of the Elchasites. It is, 
moreover, established that the ritual of Mandean baptism owed much to 
the ritual of the Syrian Nestorians. A common origin is presumable; but 
to bring all back, including the Christian eucharist, to Mandean rites, is
pure wilfulness.
<P>
[16] See the texts cited in note 15. Belief in Jesus as the Son of God passed 
through the following stages. In the first stage he was consecrated God's 
Son and Christ by his resurrection (Romans i, 4); in the second, the 
consecration was thrown back to his baptism (prevailing perspective of the 
Synoptics); in the third, it was further thrown back to his conception. 
The idea of the Christ as pre-existent was bound to end in proclaiming him 
Son of God from all eternity.
<P>
[17] The trinitarian formula in Matthew xxviii, 19 was probably added 
at the canonical revision and Mark xvi, 16 at the final deutero-canonical 
revision. In Luke xxiv, 47 baptism is implied only, as it must have originally 
been in the text of Matthew. John iii, 22 represents Jesus as himself baptizing. 
But the statement is attenuated in iv, 2 and vii, 39.
<P>
[18] If Jesus baptized he did so under the same conditions as John. Some 
writers would have us believe that Jesus separated from John because he 
attached no importance to baptism. A refinement of the imagination!
<P>
[19] Mark vi, 32-34 and parallels. In Mark viii, 1-9 and Matthew xv, 32-39 
there is a second multiplication of loaves which is a duplicate of the first. 
Mark's reason for admitting the duplicate is to make the first a type of 
Jewish-Christian initiation and the second of hellenist-Christian. In John 
vi, 51-58 (discourse on the bread of life) the symbolism of flesh and blood 
is brought into relation with the multiplication of the loaves (5-14).
<P>
[20] "Gnosis" in the text.
<P>
[21] 1 Corinthians xi, 2, 17-34. This is a homogeneous instruction intended 
to order the Supper in keeping with the mystical conception announced in 
24-25 and applied in 26—34. This instruction does not depend on the 
Gospels nor even on the gospel tradition, except in so far as the mystic 
conception of the Supper, linked to the mystic conception of redemption, 
is inserted into a framework, previously fixed, in which the Supper is in 
no sense a pascal meal but prefigures the festival of the elect in the Kingdom 
of God. The framework in question is also presupposed in the traditional 
accounts of the institution in the three Synoptics.
<P>
[22] The integrity of Justin's text is subject to caution. The last line about 
Jesus crucified and the Spirit as the author of the prophecies, and the earlier 
mention of the Christ and the Spirit, may have been added for conformity 
to traditional practices. Cf. Turmel, <i>Histoire des dogmes</i>, ii, 169-170.
<P>
[23] Literally "participating (incorporated) in the symbol of his death" 
and not "in the image of his death" as though the author were here teaching 
Docetism. The baptism of the Christ, not his death, is the image.
<P>
[24] The mobility of the miraculous rock in the desert is a rabbinic tradition.
Philo (<i>Legum alleg.</i>, ii, 36) says that the rock is "the wisdom of God" 
and the manna "word of God."
<P>
<center>399</center>
<P>
[25] The mention of "mingled wine" after "water" is highly suspect 
(<font face="Symbol">pothrion udatoV kai kramatoV</font>). It is probable that Justin means to 
describe a communion with bread and water, not with bread and wine. 
Cf. Harnack, <i>Brot und Wasser, die eucharist elements bei Justin</i>. On communion
without wine in Christian antiquity, see Lietzmann, <i>Messe und 
Herrenmahl</i>, 246, 249. Tatian and the encratites, Marcion also, celebrated 
without wine. What has been quoted above about communion in the 
desert (1 Corinthians x, 1-5) may well be in accord with that practice.
<P>
[26] Turmel also suspects the mention of the Spirit in this passage. See 
note 22.
<P>
[27] But Justin shows knowledge of the rendering of thanks by the 
prophets which, according to <i>Didache</i>, x, 5, might be prolonged at their 
discretion.
<P>
[28] The prayer of thanksgiving simply indicated in the Gospels. In the 
time of Justin the communion required only the exercise of thanksgiving 
over the bread and wine; the words called "the words of institution" were 
introduced into the liturgy at a later date. (They are artificially introduced 
in the liturgy of Hippolytus.)
<P>
[29] The spiritual powers who ruled the visible world and without whose 
knowledge the coming of the Son had been effected. We have seen the 
place which this piece of mythology holds in diverse parts of the New 
Testament.
<P>
[30] This confirms what has been said in note 25 of Justin's knowing the 
communion without wine.
<P>
[31] The words, "I will raise him up at the last day," have been added to
the end of verse 54.
<P>
[32] For that reason probably the explanation is addressed to the disciples, 
not to the people who, strangers to faith, are incapable of understanding it.
<P>
[33] As already said, instruction on the communion comprises 1 Corinthians
xi, 2, 19-34. It is intended to authorize the mystic communion and 
to substitute it, as a liturgical function, for the common meal, which the 
primitive Supper was, and at which real abuses might occur.
<P>
[34] Mark xiv, 22-25; Matthew xxvi, 26-29; Luke xxii, 14-20 (but the 
end of verse 19, after "given for you," and verse 20 suggest interpolation).
<P>
[35] There has been much dissertation about the meaning of the preposition 
<font face="Symbol">apo</font> (before <font face="Symbol">tou kuriou</font> in verse 23), which need not exclude intermediaries 
between Jesus and the author of the story. But on the hypothesis of intermediaries,
as the matter concerns an act of the Christ and not a plain teaching, 
we should expect <font face="Symbol">peri</font> rather than <font face="Symbol">apo</font>. The author places the case of the 
Supper among the other <font face="Symbol">paradoseiV</font> which the Corinthians have received 
from him. Are all these to be transformed into Gospel traditions passed 
on by the Galilean apostles? Moreover, whether it be tradition or private 
vision, the story as here given is not in the primitive Gospel.
<P>
[36] The words "till he come" are indispensable for the balance both of 
the phrasing and the thought. There is no ground to regard them as 
interpolated.
<P>
<center>400</center>
<P>
[37] Because Luke xxii, 19 originally contained these words only, there is 
no ground for recognizing (in excluding "this is my blood") "this is 
my body" as an authentic saying—a metaphor employed by Jesus to 
indicate the fate in store for him. None of our texts has the least suspicion 
of this metaphor. It is highly probable that the original text of Luke referred 
to a supper without wine, but having the same mystic sense as the supper 
with bread and wine. See <i>L'Evangile selon Luc</i>, 511-512.
<P>
[38] It is evident that the parallelism of the "passover," that is, the whole 
festival meal, with the "cup" (verses 17—18) is artificially created.
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER VIII</h2></center>
<P>
[1] Romans iii, 27-iv, 24, verse 25 being the transition to the gnosis 
developed in the following chapters. See above, the analysis of the Epistle,
p. 253.
<P>
[2] Romans v, 12, 18—19. The oracular style of this gnosis attests its relatively
ancient character. In 14 we read that death reigned from Adam to 
Moses even in those who had not sinned by imitation—<font face="Symbol">epi tw omoiwmati</font>—of Adam's sin. We might translate, "in the manner of Adam's sin." 
Account must be taken of this meaning of the word for the interpretation 
of vi, 5, <font face="Symbol">sumfutoi tw omoiwmati tou qanatou autou</font>, where there is 
no more question of an appearance of death (Docetism) than there is here 
question of an appearance of sin.
<P>
[3] Genesis ii, 17; iii, 19. There is nothing whatever in this ancient text, 
taken as it stands, to suggest that death is the natural consequence of sin. 
Death results from the fact that, by the will of God, man has no part of 
the tree of life, the fruit of which nourishes the immortals.
<P>
[4] <i>Leg. alleg.</i>, i, 31; <i>De opif. mundi</i>, 134. In Philo the celestial man is the 
ideal, divine and absolute type of humanity indicated in Genesis i, 27; the 
terrestrial man is the man of history, father of the human race, to which 
Genesis ii, 7 would refer.
<P>
[5] As a slave is sold to his master.
<P>
[6] The text does not mean that a non-earthly Christ has been crucified 
somewhere in the clouds by the "princes of the air," but that the "princes 
of this world" are responsible for the passion of Jesus, just as it is attributed 
in the Gospels to "the powers of darkness" (Luke xxii, 53), or to the 
"prince of this world," the devil (John xiv, 30). There is no more reason 
to substitute the devil for the "princes" of 1 Corinthians and to identify 
him with Marcion's demiurge.
<P>
[7] Romans viii, 18-27. The whole of this passage differs in style from 
that of the context; rather ponderous prose in which there is no parallelism;
viii, 28 joins on quite naturally to 17.
<P>
[8] Differing in this respect from Romans v-vi, where the gnosis may 
borrow Biblical language here and there but not as specific quotations;
<P>
<center>401</center>
<P>
doubtless because it is being developed on a system of its own and not as a
commentary on particular texts.
<P>
[9] It would be better to translate, or rather to transcribe, "by which he 
made even the <i>aeons</i>," but without taking this word in the full gnostic 
sense. The word belongs to the gnostic vocabulary, and has a meaning 
analogous to that of gnosis.
<P>
[10] The text (Psalm viii, 6) says: "Thou hast made him but little inferior 
to Elohim," or "to the Elohim."
<P>
[11] Hebrews vii, 1-2. "King of Righteousness" is the author's etymology 
of Melchisedec. The original may well have meant the god "Sedec is my 
King" (compare Adonizedec, "Sedec is my Lord," name of a king of 
Jerusalem in Joshua x, i). Salem is understood by the author in its etymological
sense. Very probably it refers to Jerusalem.
<P>
[12] vii, 14. The author reasons as though Melchisedec had no real 
ancestors and never died. But the point of interest for us lies in the author's 
intention to ignore the earthly origin of Jesus.
<P>

<P>
[14] <font face="Symbol">kaq' omoiothta</font> helps us to understand <font face="Symbol">omoiwma</font> in Romans vi, 3-6.
<P>
[15] xi, 2-40. We are even told (3) that "by faith the aeons fell into order 
at the word of God and the visible was not made of things that appear." 
This, though hardly intelligible to us, corresponds to what was said in the 
preamble i, 2 (see note 9 above). We would say that eternal ideas are realized 
in the visible world; but, to our author, the eternal ideas, as such, are just 
as real, if not more real, as they are when visibly externalized.
<P>
[16] Cf. ix, 11-12, and the prayer <i>Supplices</i> in the Roman canon of the 
Mass. The Epistle to the Hebrews, which has sometimes been said to be 
indifferent to the Eucharist, if not to oppose it, is on the contrary full of 
eucharistic symbolism. We read (x, 10) that "we were sanctified by the 
offering" made once for all "of the body of Jesus Christ," by "the blood of 
the covenant" (x, 29).
<P>
[17] The Peratae used the same expression—"in him all the pleroma judged 
good to dwell" (<i>Philosophoumena</i>, v, 2). In our next chapter the gnostics 
will be speaking to us again about the pleroma. The term means—God 
and the spiritual world as it subsists in God and forms his plenitude. The 
concept is founded on the idea of emanation from the source and return 
to it. The application of it to the Christ has never been fully and openly 
made by Christianity, where it has been rather compressed than developed, 
especially in the theology of the Latin Church. Two parallel strophes may 
be distinguished in the quoted passage (15-17, 18-20).
<P>
[18] The conception is at once physical and theological. The <font face="Symbol">stoiceia</font>
are the principal parts of the cosmos and the four elements thought to 
constitute all bodies; but they are also the astral spirits on whom all parts 
of the cosmos, including humanity, were held to depend. (See Toussaint, 
<i>L'Epitre de S. Paul aux Colossiens</i>, 137-146.)
<P>
[19] The Divinity, or the divine world, being, as it were, externalized in 
the Christ, who is the true pleroma.
<P>
<center>402</center>
<P>
[20] The word <font face="Symbol">peplhrwmenoi</font> plays with "pleroma." The literal
translation would be "pleromed"—introduced into the pleroma.
<P>
[21] We get a glimpse of what this catastrophe of the pleroma may have 
meant in the thought of this Christian writer; but one would like to know 
what the catastrophe meant—for there certainly was one—in the system 
which the gnosis of our Epistle opposes, while yet imitating it.
<P>
[22] See above, p. 255.
<P>
[23] The meaning is that believers are parts in an invisible pleroma whose 
radiance is continually obstructed by the visible world in the condition to 
which it has come after its perversion by the "principalities" whom the
Christ has conquered.
<P>
[24] Literally "the body." The real substance of the true mystery, which
is the true salvation, is in the pleroma-Church, which is the body of the
Christ.
<P>
[25] Unintelligible passage. Guided by verse 23 perhaps we may read
verse 18 simply: <font face="Symbol">en tapeinofrosunh kai eqelorhskia twn aggelwn</font>. 
<P>
[26] The word <font face="Symbol">embateuwn</font> is a word of the mystery-language denoting
the "first step" of initiation.
<P>
[27] <font face="Symbol">stoiceia</font>. See note 18.
<P>
[28] Terms borrowed from the mystery the author is attacking.
<P>
[29] Prone to exaggeration as Paul was he can hardly have said that the 
Gospel in his time had been preached to "every creature under heaven." 
Cf. the spurious ending of Mark (xvi, 15), where we find the same formula.
<P>
[30] In some circles Jahveh Sabaoth was identified with Zeus Sabazios.
On the origin of this Epistle see p. 26.
<P>
[31] The name in question is "Lord," <font face="Symbol">kurioV</font>;, a word of the Jahveh-cult. 
It is not the name "Jesus" which is above every name. Moreover, it is the 
name "Lord" that stands out in the concluding confession. The name 
"Jesus" corresponds to the abasement of the Christ, and "Lord" to his
exaltation.
<P>
[32] Verse 25 may be intended by the author in a spiritual sense and 28 a
comment in terms of the common belief (see <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 214). 
The descent into Hades is an old mythological theme which has undergone 
various transformations in the theologies. Ishtar in Babylonian mythology 
goes down to bring back Tammuz; the vegetation gods, who die and 
revive, also descend into Hades and return. Later the myth was sublimated. 
We have seen how the descent is treated in Philippians; there it becomes 
the descent of a celestial being into an inferior world. In some gnostic 
systems an aeon falls out of the pleroma and has to be ransomed. The 
descent of the Christ to the abode of the dead makes contact on one side
with this old mythology.
<P>
[33] Romans x, 6, 7; Ephesians iv, 9-10 mention the descent only, without
speaking of the Christ's activity among the dead. Matthew xxvii, 51-5} 
seems to imply the descent without definitely adopting it.
<P>
[34] <i>Dialogue</i>, 72. The Jeremiah text is quoted by Irenaeus to the same 
purpose. <i>Apostolic Preaching</i>, 78; <i>Heresies</i>, iv, 22. Ignatius, <i>Magnesians</i>, ix, 2,
<P>
<center>403</center>
<P>
says that Jesus went to raise the prophets because they had been his disciples 
in spirit. Hermas, <i>Parable</i>, ii, 16, has the dead evangelized by the apostles, 
not by the Christ.
<P>
[35] On this point see Harnack, <i>Marcion</i>, 170.
<P>
[36] It was early remarked that the Logos is called <font face="Symbol">qeoV</font> not <font face="Symbol">o qeoV</font>. He is 
divine but not God absolutely.
<P>
[37] To get the balance of the thought and the rhythm the words <font face="Symbol">o gegonen</font>
should be made part of verse 4, as many ancient witnesses do, instead of 
joining them to 3, where they have no reason to be.
<P>
[38] Everything lives by the Logos and in the Logos. Recall the pleroma,

[50] Genesis i, 2. The darkness floating over the Abyss is here one of the 
elements in the primal chaos and has nothing of the moral meaning attached 
to the darkness of John i, 5, where darkness is the equivalent of evil, as in 
the religion of Zoroaster.
<P>
[41] John xii, 31; xiv, 30; xvi, 11. The "prince of this world" has the 
function of the "principalities" and "powers," spoken of in the Epistles;
but his character is perceptibly different. He did not originally belong to 
the pleroma and can never have been a part of it.
<P>
[42] John viii, 44. This passage defines the nature of the devil, "a homicide 
from the beginning," "liar and father of lies," in whom truth is not. There 
is no question of his initial fall: he has always been as we find him to-day. 
See <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 299—301.
<P>
[43] John i, 9-12. All the references to John the Baptist (6-8, 15) appear 
to have been added to the poem of the incarnate Logos: ditto the last 
member of verse 13. "Those who believe in his name" explains the preceding 
line of the poem and the plural of the verbs in verse 13 (in the traditional 
text) agrees with the explaining line.
<P>
[44] The reading <font face="Symbol">oV . . . egennhqh</font> in place of <font face="Symbol">oi . . . eggenhqhsan</font> is that of 
Irenaeus and Tertullian and Justin seems to read it so. This verse refers 
quite naturally to the birth of the Logos in time, his appearance in human 
form, but would come in very awkwardly if understood of the birth of 
believers, of which, however, the divine sonship of Jesus is the prototype. 
See <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 101—104.
<P>
[45] The word "and we saw his glory, glory like that which an only 
begotten son might take from his father" is an irrelevant intrusion which 
arrests the development of the sentence and breaks the rhythm. It is in the 
manner of i John i, 1.
<P>
[46] This "plenitude" is not the pleroma of gnosis—and the point is 
worthy of note as marking the relations of our Gospel to religious doctrines 
ot the time—but explains what has just been said of the Logos (verse 14) as 
full of grace and truth," what is now added being the direct sequel to this 
assertion.
<P>
[47] Many interpreters, reluctant to think that the word "grace" in this
<P>
<center>404</center>
<P>
formula can be taken in its proper sense of benefit, but with two different 
objects—since, according to the context (14 and 17), grace is eternal life, 
the objective gift of salvation—deem it possible to translate not "grace 
(eternal life) for grace (gift of the Law)" but "grace upon grace," that is, 
superabundance of salvation. But the following lines, which are explanatory, 
favour the first interpretation, to which the Johannine language is not 
repugnant. It is only in the gnosis of Paul's Epistles that the Law cannot 
be spoken of as a "grace," or divine favour, in the ordinary sense of the
word.
<P>
[48] Cf. the "invisible God" of Colossians i, 15.
<P>
[49] This is the meaning of i, 13—14 even if we do not admit the reading 
(<font face="Symbol">oV eggenhqh</font>) of Irenaeus and Tertullian. None the less the Son, in the 
body of the Gospel, is conceived to pre-exist, as Son, to his incarnation in
the flesh.
<P>
[50] The passages in our Gospel which speak of the resurrection of the 
dead in the strict sense of the formula, that of rising up after death and 
burial, are probably the insertions of an editor. They are v, 28-29; vi, 29,
40, 44, 54.
<P>
[51] The author of the Epistle has in view specially xix, 34, water and
blood issuing from the side of Jesus when pierced by the soldier's lance. 
Misunderstanding of the spirit of both our Gospel and the Epistle reaches 
its limit in those who have imagined that decomposition of the blood 
might have produced what looked like a flow of blood and water, or that 
the decomposition might have been invented to prove against Marcion 
that the blood of Jesus was real. See <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 492.
<P>
[52] Cf. vii, 39.

[56] Acts i, 3-11. This preamble, artificially attached to the prologue (1-2), 
which has been mutilated and interpolated for that purpose, gives the 
impression of being a resume or extract cut out from a more complete and 
developed story closely analogous if not identical with what we read in
the Apocalypse of Peter.
<P>
[57] The scene is analogous to that of Acts in what concerns the revelation
on a mountain, but the sketching more cursory.
<P>
[58] The background the same as in Acts i, 3-11 but the source document
is more systematically rearranged.

<P>
(Ephesians, 19) but not in direct relation with Matthew ii, 2, y, 9-10, as
we might hastily conclude. For the first statement made is that the birth 
of the Christ was unknown to "the prince of this world," and that the 
Lord was revealed "to the worlds" (aeons) by the star which eclipsed all 
other stars, destroyed magic and every bond of iniquity—which can only 
be understood of the Christ glorified in his resurrection.

[1] With de Faye, <i>Gnostiques</i>, 430.
<P>
[2] Origen, <i>C. Celsum</i>, v, 72. Celsus says that the Helenians took the 
name from their master Helenos. This must be a mistake of Celsus or of 
the source on which he depends.
<P>
[3] Origen (<i>C. Celsum</i>, i, 57; vi, 15; <i>In Johannem</i>, xiii, 27) represents 
Dositheus as a Samaritan Messiah who appeared after Jesus and at the same 
time as Simon; in like manner Hegesippus in Eusebius, iv, 22, 5. In the 
apocryphal Clementines (<i>Homilies</i>, ii, 23; <i>Recognitions</i>, i, 54; ii, 8) Dositheus 
is said to have been a disciple of John the Baptist and to have succeeded 
him as leader of the sect he had founded and to have soon been supplanted 
by Simon.
<P>
[4] This results from the testimony of Origen. See the preceding note.
<P>
[5] The doctrine and the practice of the Simonians here meet the gnosis of 
Carpocrates, which we shall consider later on, and their Docetism constitutes
an affinity to Marcion. The idea that the same divinity reveals 
himself, and may be worshipped under different names, is met with elsewhere.
<P>
[6] Hippolytus used an addition called <i>Apophasis megale</i> which he attributed 
to Simon. This stands in the closest affinity to the system of Valentinus 
and may well not come from the Simonian sect at all.

<P>
[14] Ignatius, <i>Magnesians</i>, 8, 2, doubtless alludes to Sige when he says 
that Christ is the eternal Logos, who does <i>not</i> proceed from Silence (reading 
of the Greek MSS.).
<P>
[15] It is not easy to find one's way through this system which has doubtless 
come down to us with retouchings. Inconsistence and duplication may 
well have existed in the original. But as there are three Saviours (Horos, 
Christos and the aeon Jesus) and two Wisdoms (Sophia and Hacamoth) 
we may suppose (invoking the resume in Epiphanius, <i>Heresies</i>, xxxi, 4, 
where there seems to be only one Saviour) that the system was originally 
constructed on the fall of Sophia who assumed the part of Hacamoth, and 
on a scheme of redemption simplified to that extent (Bousset, <i>Gnosis</i>, 342). 
Even so the authentic quotations in Clement are enough to show that 
Valentinus did not construct his system with much regard to modern 
notions of probability.
<P>
[16] <i>Stromata</i>, iii, 7, 59. Clement says elsewhere (vi, 8, 71) that Jesus was 
<font face="Symbol">apaqhV</font>. The Gospel of Peter (<i>Fragment</i>, verse 10) seems to say the same. 
Perhaps the Gospel of the Egyptians started this doctrine.
<P>
[17] In the fragment of a homily quoted by Clement, iv, 13, 69, Valentinus 
addresses the initiates of his sect as follows: "You are immortal from the 
beginning"—that is, by nature—"you have challenged death"—in your 
human bodies—"that you might conquer death and that death might die 
in you and by you. So then, when you put the world to flight and scatter 
its deceitful elements without scattering the energies of your mind, you are 
the sovereigns of creation and masters of all perishable realities." We may 
see from this that Valentinus was not without eloquence nor even without 
philosophy. But Clement was not altogether mistaken in saying that 
Valentinus attributes to his "spirituals" the work of Jesus Christ himself. 
Between his "spiritual" mind and a stoic sage the difference is not great.
<P>
[18] Cf. Burkitt, <i>Early Eastern Christianity</i> (1904), 156—192.

[19] The quotations from Heracleon made by Origen in his commentary

[26] 1 Clement, 47. The reference is to 1 Corinthians i, 10-12: "The 
epistle of the blessed Paul, the apostle, which he first wrote to you at the 
beginning of the Gospel." A little further on we find a paraphrase, without 
reference to the hymn of charity (xiii, 1—7). To make this hymn depend on 
Clement is a gross misconstruction alike of the hymn and of the Clementine 
letter. If Clement is in nowise inspired, for his doctrine, by the salvation 
gnosis contained in the Epistles, there were many others like him who 
wrote after the formation of the canon.
<P>
[27] In the third century Marcionism was still formidable enough for 
Origen to be at pains lo refute it. At the time of Epiphanius (<i>obit</i>., 403) 
there were Marcionites in Rome, in Egypt as far as the Thebaid, in Palestine, 
Arabia, Syria, Cyprus, and even in Persia. Perhaps the last adepts of the 
sect were absorbed into Manicheism which was closely akin to their doctrine. 
We may indeed consider Mani, who invoked the names of Zoroaster, 
Buddha and Jesus, as the last of the great gnostics. His religious doctrine 
had the same basis as the ancient Persian religion, later penetrated by 
Babylonian influence (Reitzenstein, <i>Das iranische Erlosungsmysterium</i>, 94).
<P>
<center><h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER X</h2></center>
<P>
[1] This results from the close connexion between Didache, xv and xiv. 
The <i>Didache</i> makes no mention of presbyters (elders)—priests—just as 
there is no mention of them in Philippians i, 1; in 1 Timothy iii, 2-13; in 
1 Clement 42, 4; in Hennas, Vision, iii, 5, 1.
<P>
[2] <i>Vision</i>, ii, 4, 3. The difficulty of identifying the Clement of Hermas 
with the author of the so-called Epistle of Clement would be insurmountable 
if the composition of this letter is dated in the reign of Domatian (81-96), 
but there would be no difficulty if the letter is not earlier than 125-135. 
We should then conclude that neither the Clement of the Epistle and of 
Hermas, nor the Hermas of The Shepherd were disciples of the apostles, and 
that there is no mention of them in the New Testament.
<P>
[3] See <i>Vision</i>, iii, 5, 1, a curious passage which still takes the word
<P>
<center>408</center>

"apostle" in the wide sense of an itinerant preacher, but shows the importance 
attached to the presbyteral episcopate by giving it prior place to the teaching
apostle and to the teaching prophet.

heads of the Church")—-compare Hebrews xiii, 7, 17, 24 and 1 Clement i, 
3; 21, 6. <i>Vision</i>, ii, 4, 3 ("the presbyters presiding over the Church").
<P>
[5] <i>Vision</i>, iii, 9, 7—10. The same persons are aimed at in <i>Parable</i>, viii, 7, 
4—6, as "faithful and good men but given to jealousy about preferments 
and honours, and all completely in bondage to the folly of striving for the
first place and for honours."
<P>
[6] Recall the testimony of Justin, 1 <i>Apology</i>, 65, 67, quoted above.
<P>
[7] Compare "the holy vine of David" in <i>Didache</i>, 9, 2.
<P>
[8] In 1 <i>Apology</i>, 8 Justin says of the only God what Marcion was saying 
about the demiurge: that he extracted the world "from unformed matter." 
If Justin did not believe that matter was eternal, he does not seem to have
asked himself whence it came.
<P>
[9] In contrast to the Paul of 1 Corinthians vii, the Paul of the Pastorals 
recommends marriage in positive terms (cf. 1 Timothy ii, 15; v, 14; Titus
ii, 4).
<P>
[10] Irenaeus (<i>Heresies</i>, i, preface) and Tertullian (<i>De Praescriptione</i>),
without prejudice to the authenticity of the passage, apply it to Valentinus. 
Tertullian applies the passage recommending marriage (1 Timothy iv, 2-3)
to Marcion. Cf. 2 Timothy ii, 14; iii, 7.
<P>
[11] It will be noted that the distinction between spiritual and psychic is 
clearly laid down in 1 Corinthians ii, 10-16. In the sequel (iii, 1-3) the 
psychics are said to be "carnal." We have seen above that Valentinus had 
three classes—pneumatics, psychics and hylics (material).
<P>
[12] The private meeting of Polycarp and Marcion of which Irenaeus 
speaks {<i>Heresies</i>, iii, 3, 4) might have taken place at Rome. If Polycarp 
died in 166 he might have come to Rome about 160.

[14] <i>Exposition</i>, 3 (from the Italian translation by Faldati).
<P>
[15] On this point see especially Bacon, <i>Studies in Matthew</i>, 18-23.
<P>
[16] See also Bacon, 32-36. 
<P>
[17] See Bacon, <i>Is Mark a Roman Gospel?</i> (1919); cf. <i>Revue d'histoire et de
litterature religieuses</i>, 1920, 427—430.
<P>
[18] There is high probability that John xxi, 15-23 (the commission to 
Peter) was written in Asia for the satisfaction of the Roman community 
(see <i>Le quatrieme Evangile</i>, 69-71). Again, in the Book of Acts the 
forced introduction of John's name into headlines (iii, i, 3-4, 19; viii, 6), 
and the apparently forced silence kept about the martyrdom of John in 
xii, 2, where only the martyrdom of James is mentioned, may well have 
been a concession made by Rome in favour of the Ephesian legend of the 
beloved disciple. (See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 55, 218-223, 227, 246, 368,
481-484.)
<P>

<P>
[19] See <i>Les Actes des Apotres</i>, 669-680, 777.
<P>
[20] See especially 1 Clement, 26, 2 (Hebrews i, 3-4). It is certain that 
Clement uses the Epistle to the Hebrews, but he does not quote it as having 
canonical authority. As to his other quotations, he refers to 1 Corinthians 
as historical evidence and not precisely as an officially sanctioned writing.
<P>
[21] <i>De Pudicitia</i>, 20: "Et utique receptior (more widely accepted) apud 
ecclesias epistola Barnabae illo apocrypho (forbidden for public use) Pastore 
moechorum."
<P>
[22] <i>Heresies</i>, iii, 11, 9; <i>Exposition</i>, 99-100 (Faldati's translation, 168-9).
<P>
[23] The canon of Muratori justifies the exclusion of <i>The Shepherd</i> on 
the grounds that the collection of prophets is complete in the Old Testament 
and that, not being apostolic, it cannot be admitted into the New.
<P>
[24] 1 <i>Apology</i>, 6.
<P>
[25] Text after Lietzmann, <i>Symbolstudien</i>, xiv, in <i>Zeitschrift fur N.W.</i>, 
1927, p. 91.

[29] Streeter, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Bacon, 58.
<P>
[30] The interpretation given by Bacon (55) of the passage in Tertullian, 
<i>De Pudicitia</i>, where he says that <i>The Shepherd</i> has been judged apocryphal 
and spurious, "ab omni concilio ecclesiarum," seems rather forced. The 
reference is not to a succession of set Councils, but simply to unanimous 
agreement.
<P>
[31] The word <font face="Symbol">ceirotonhsate</font> here translated "choose" does not 
necessarily imply the laying on of hands, but that meaning may be supposed.
<P>
[32] 1 Timothy iii, 1-13; iv, 14; v, 1, 19; 2 Timothy i, 1-6; ii, 24-26;
iv, 18-20; Titus i, 5-9 (where the "presbyters" of 5 are individualized in 
the "bishop" of 7).
<P>
[33] The Diotrephes of 3 John 9, even if he had no personal existence, is 
an historical type of the bishop with no liking for wandering preachers.
<P>
[34] This should be taken as meaning a strict monogamy.
<P>
[35] Nevertheless Philippi may have had as bishop the Valens who is said by 
Polycarp (<i>Epistle</i>, 11) to have made himself unworthy of his office (hypothesis 
of Delafosse, <i>Lettres de Ignace d'Antioche</i>, 33).
<P>
[36] 1 Clement, 42, 44. The language of the author of these passages is 
clearly not that of a man who had known the apostles and was writing 
only thirty years after the death of Peter and Paul.
<P>
[37] Tertullian seems to have applied to the Marcionites in particular 
what he says of gnostics in general, <i>De Praescriptione</i>, 41.
<P>
Ante sunt perfect; catechumeni quam edocti. Ipsae mulieres haereticae 
quam procaces! . . . Ordinationes eorum temerariae, leves, inconstantes:
nunc neophytos collocant, nunc saeculo obstrictos, nunc apostatas 
nostros . , . Itaque alius hodie episcopus, eras alius; hodie diaconus qui
<P>
<center>410</center>
<P>
eras lector; hodie presbyter qui eras laicus: nam et laicis sacerdotalia 
numera injungunt.
<P>
[38] In 172, according to the <i>Chronicle</i> of Eusebius; in 152, according to 
Hippolytus, <i>Heresies</i>, 48, 1. See the discussion of these dates in P. de 
Labriolle, <i>La Crise Montaniste</i>, 569. Maximilla died about 180, Montanus 
and Priscilla having previously disappeared. The date 172 mav be a little 
too late; it is a question whether it originally referred to the outbreak of 
the movement or to some event which brought it to the attention of the 
communities.

[39] Irenaeus and the martyrs of Lyons, without positively approving the 
saints of Phrygia, wished them not to be condemned. The attitude of Pope 
Eleutherus seems to have conformed to the views of Irenaeus. Tertullian, 
<i>Adv. Praxeam</i>, 1, speaks of a bishop of Rome who, on the point of giving 
express recognition to the Montanist prophesyings, was circumvented by 
the logician Praxeas, so that he suppressed the letter of approval which he 
had already written. It was probably round Zephyrinus (198-217) in the 
first years of his episcopate that Praxeas wove his plots.
<P>
[40] Approximate date. The attitude of the bishop of Rome to Montanism 
seems to have contributed, at least indirectly, to the secession of Tertullian.
