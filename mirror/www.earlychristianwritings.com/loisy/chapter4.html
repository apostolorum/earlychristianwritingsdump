<P>
<center><h2>THE BIRTH OF APOSTOLIC PROPAGANDA</h2></center>
<p>AN ardent, regulated and almost methodical propaganda was
now to be launched which, in less than thirty years, would carry the Christian
religion to all the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean and as far as Rome,
but under conditions which only permit us to catch glimpses of the chief stages
in a mighty movement and to follow a few of its protagonists. As far as we can
judge, this was not achieved by the proper and direct initiative of the
Aramaic-speaking group of believers gathered in Jerusalem. The propulsive force
that carried the new religion into the Mediterranean world was the force of the
blow that had struck Stephen. Up to that moment the effort to make converts, in
the conditions we have just studied, had been confined to Jerusalem. It is not
certain, as some would have it, that small groups of believers existed in
Galilee at that time, to which we might attribute the spread of the Gospel to
Damascus. The invective against the Galilean towns (Matthew xi, 20-24; Luke x,
12-15) and the symbolic check to the preaching of Jesus at Nazareth (Mark vi,
1-6; Matthew xiii, 53-58; Luke iv, 15-30) would rather invite the conclusion
that there were no groups of believers in Galilee in apostolic times. It may
well be that the Jewish-Christian propaganda was roused into activity only by
the Hellenistic-Christian, and did not become effective in North Palestine,
Transjordania and Syria until after the migration thitherward of the Jerusalem
community at the beginning of the Jewish war.

</p>
<p>If the Christian religion which spoke in Aramaic was not
without a future, if it was even destined to exert indirectly a profound
influence on Christianity as a universal religion, that religion could not
exist, and had in fact no existence, so long as the pagan world was unreached by
its message. And the pagan world was not even touched so long as propagandist
activity was confined to Jewish circles in Jerusalem, or even in Palestine. By
the action of the Sanhedrim, the most active among the new believers, the most
open minded, or if it be preferred, the least

</p>
<p align="center">122

</p>
<p>imprisoned within Judaism were driven abroad into various
provinces of the Roman Empire where, in a very short time, they did a work
remarkable in its results and astonishing in its success.

</p>
<p>On evidence derived from the Epistles preserved under his
name, the foundation of hellenistic Christianity, that is of the Christian
Church, of the historic Christian religion, is still generally attributed to
Paul. But, if his role was of such capital importance, how comes it that ancient
Christian documents, the Didache and the so-called Epistle of Barnabas, seem to
ignore him, and that the Apocalypse of John, though more judaizing in style than
in spirit, makes his school, if not his memory, the object of attack? It is the
Paul of the Epistles who is aimed at in the letters to tile Asiatic Churches in
Revelation ii, 2, 9, 14-15,20-24; iii, 9. 

</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that he was a contributor to founding the
churches of Asia, they did not claim him, in the second century, as their
founder, while the silence of the apologist Justin in regard to him is
outstandingly significant. In the course of the second century, circumstances
furnished him with an important collection of epistles, now gathered into the
New Testament, and these, together with the combinations worked up in Acts,
which give a considerable place to his missions, have made it possible to
construct a scheme of Christian Origins partly false and too simple in relation
to the complicated reality. Paul, for us, is the best known of the first
Christian missionaries to the pagan world; but he was not the one and only
missionary, nor even quite the first; he was simply the most active. The
influence which his epistles came, ultimately, to acquire ought not to be
credited entirely to his apostolic career; for the problem which now presents
itself is just that of finding out whether the elaborate gnosis developed in the
Epistles really belonged to their presumed author, to Paul. Even if that problem
be set aside, it seems beyond doubt that the diffusion of the Christian religion
in the pagan world had begun before Paul became a partner in the work, and that,
notwithstanding his large contribution, it went on its course to a great extent
independently of him. [1]

</p>
<p>In order that our departure may be taken from a point of
utmost certainty, let us fix attention on the following incomplete but
trustworthy account in the Book of Acts (xi, 19-21): &quot;They that were
scattered abroad by the persecution in the time of

</p>
<p align="center">123

</p>
<p>Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia&quot; — that is, to
the hellenized towns of the Phoenician coast, including Caesarea, which, though
the residence of the procurator of Judea, was not a Jewish town — &quot;and to
Cyprus and to Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews. But there
were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, when they were come to Antioch,
spake to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was
with them and a great number&quot; — of uncircumcised as well as Jews —
&quot;believed and turned unto the Lord. And it was at Antioch that the
disciples&quot; — the believers in Jesus — &quot;were first called
Christians.&quot; In the pagan world the name of the sect is the name here
indicated by Acts, and the foundation of the first hellenist-Christian community
was the occasion of its adoption. In the Jewish, aramaic-speaking world, on the
other hand, the adherents of the new faith, according to the same book of Acts,
were called Nazoreans, following the title given to Jesus himself. &quot;For we
have found this man (Paul) a pestilent fellow ... and a ringleader of the sect
of the Nazoreans&quot; (xxiv, 5). [2]

</p>
<p>The text previously cited (xi, 19-21) comes from the same
source as the account of the hellenistic group at Jerusalem and of the martyrdom
of Stephen, to which it forms the natural sequel, but is here converted into a
brief introduction to what the author is intent on telling about the foundation
of the first community to be recruited, at least in part, from among the
uncircumcised pagans. Phoenicia and Cyprus are quickly passed over, but the
author's meaning is, clearly, that in these two countries, as in the first place
at Antioch, the word was carried to the Jews, but &quot;to Jews only.&quot; If
the source has nothing to say about the results of this preaching, it is because
its author was in haste to get on to the mission at Antioch and the exploits of
Paul. The editor of Acts, for his part, presupposes, in what he has to tell of
Phoenicia, the existence there of groups of Christian recruits from the Jewish
population, and contents himself with a few legends about the ministry of
Philip, one of the Seven, in Samaria, before his settlement at Caesarea. It is
probable that some of the fugitives found their way also to Alexandria, whence
Apollos was later to come, but Acts knew nothing of them, or preferred to say
nothing. 

</p>
<p>Believers in Jesus also came early to Rome, but we are left
equally in the dark as to the conditions. Let us not overlook the fact that

</p>
<p align="center">124

</p>
<p>the missionaries who &quot;spoke to the Greeks&quot; were
strangers to the country, this one from Cyprus, the other from Cyrene. (We shall
learn their names a little later.) From this it would seem that the hellenistic
believers who fled from Jerusalem after the death of Stephen did not seek refuge
in the countries of their birth, and were not merely bent on saving their lives,
but concerned also to carry on elsewhere a propaganda to which Jerusalem gave no
support. Beyond that we cannot say what considerations and what circumstances
suggested to these propagandists the choice of their destination. But it seems
clear that the desire to proclaim their message held priority over personal
interest. Without this ardour of apostleship it is indeed impossible to explain
the prompt diffusion of the sect. To make known to the Jews of the Dispersion
that Jesus was about to return as the Christ was to them a mission of extreme
urgency. Nevertheless, however urgent they deemed their message to be, they
believed they had time to deliver it, and that belief brought some enlargement
of perspective to the hope which had caused the Galilean disciples to return to
Jerusalem.

</p>
<p>What these passages tell us about the foundation of the
Antioch community contradicts the traditional legend presented elsewhere in
Acts, which gives Peter the initiative in the conversion of the Gentiles; and it
contradicts the legend, also traditional, but scientifically exaggerated in
recent times, which makes out that Paul was the first apostle, and the universal
apostle, of the Gentile world and indeed the veritable founder of the
hellenistic-Christian Church.

</p>
<p>According to the first legend, Peter, during the interval
between the death of Stephen and the foundation of the mixed community at
Antioch, and after the propagators of the Gospel had made some converts in
Samaria and the coast towns of Phoenicia, undertook a sort of pastoral visit to
the new groups there recruited by evangelists who were not apostles. In Samaria,
accompanied by John, who remains a dumb figure, we find him bestowing the Holy
Spirit on Philip's converts, which Philip had been unable to bestow upon them,
and confounding one of the converts, the famous magician, Simon, who had offered
for cash down to buy the power to confer the Spirit, so that he, Simon, might
bestow the gift himself. [3] After which, we are given to

</p>
<p align="center">125

</p>
<p>understand that Peter, making a similar tour of the coast
towns, where he at once performed some miracles, [4] travelling this time alone,
was guided to carry the Gospel to the centurion, Cornelius, a man of substance
friendly to the Jews — the guidance being furnished by a paraphernalia of
revelations constructed on the same model as those by which the Book of Acts
prepared the baptism of Saul-Paul by Ananias, and also to be met with in the
mysteries of Isis. [5] The interview of Peter and Cornelius, their reciprocal
explanations and the subsequent discourse of Peter are somewhat lacking in
interest. The object of the discourse is to exhibit Peter as the very first to
proclaim before a pagan audience the principle of universal salvation by faith
in the Christ, the principle which this legend of conversion is designed
throughout to illustrate and figuratively to set forth.

</p>
<p>The third act of the pious drama is the baptism of
Cornelius and his household under a kind of mandate from the Holy Spirit, who
descends on the catechumens before the sacrament is administered. This legend,
somewhat abbreviated, is repeated in the account of his conduct which Peter is
represented as rendering to the community at Jerusalem. As the conversion of
Cornelius symbolizes the conversion of the Gentiles, so the misgivings of the
Jerusalem community symbolize the opposition of the Judaizing party, while
Peter's answer to their complaint is designed to show that the little Pentecost
of Caesarea puts the pagans on the same footing as the believers of Israel
baptized in the Spirit at the great Pentecost in Jerusalem. Thus the question of
the salvation of the uncircumcised, by faith alone and baptism, is answered,
always symbolically, before it arose in reality. But there is matter for a smile
when, after hearing Peter, under reprimand for eating with Gentiles, prove so
solidly that he has done well, one goes on to read in the Epistle to the
Galatians (li, 11-14) how Paul fell foul of this same Peter for refusing to sit
at the same table with the uncircumcised.

</p>
<p>Simon Peter may well have been the leading spirit in the
genesis of the faith, but his role in reality was always little more than that
of an apostle to the circumcision. No doubt it was impossible for him to be
anything else, although, when the time for it came, he did not oppose the
admission of pagans into the community by baptism without circumcision — so
much may be

</p>
<p align="center">126

</p>
<p>retained from Galatians ii, 9, 12. There is no evidence of
his going far away from Jerusalem before the year 44. Peter, James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, and &quot;James, the brother of the Lord&quot; [6] were the
chief figures of the Jewish-Christian community in Jerusalem during the first
twelve or fifteen years of its existence. The legend of Cornelius is the
creation of a time considerably later when an effort was made to give Peter
prominence in relation to Paul, to exhibit him as representing the authentic and
primitive apostolic tradition, the founder and first appointed leader of the
universal church embracing both Jewish and pagan elements. [7]

</p>
<p>The legend of Paul has undergone a parallel amplification
to that of Peter, but on two different lines: first, by his own statements or by
the tradition of his Epistles designed to make him the possessor of the true
Gospel and of a strictly personal mission for the conversion of the Gentile
world; and then by the common tradition for the purpose of subordinating his
role and activity to the work of the Twelve, and especially of Peter regarded as
the chief instrument of the apostolate instituted by Jesus.

</p>
<p>Relying on the Epistles and disregarding their apologetic
and tendentious character, even in much that concerns the person of Paul, though
this perhaps is secondary, criticism is apt to conclude that Paul from his
conversion onwards had full consciousness of an exceptional calling as apostle
to the pagans, and that he set to work, resolutely and alone, to conquer the
world, drawing in his wake the leaders of Judaic Christianity, whether willing
or not. And this, indeed, is how things happened if we take the indications of
the Galatian Epistle at their face value. There we encounter an apostle who
holds his commission from God only, who has a gospel peculiar to himself given
him by immediate revelation, and has already begun the conquest of the whole
Gentile world. No small claim! (Galatians i, 11-12, 15-17, 21-24; ii, 7-8).

</p>
<p>But. things did not really happen in that way, and could
not have so happened. Paul did not arrive in Syria and Antioch in order to
preside at the foundation of the first community of hellenizing Christians and
to place himself at the head of missionaries who had come there before him, as
Galatians ii, 1-10 might very naturally lead us to infer. Not only does the
quite trust-

</p>
<p align="center">127

</p>
<p>worthy account in Acts xi, 20-21 make it clear that the
first conversions of the non-circumcised were made by believers from Cyprus and
Cyrene, while a supplement, otherwise needing caution (xi, 22-26), sends
Barnabas to seek out Paul at Tarsus [8] not till after their conversion had
taken place — not only this, but another notice entirely consistent (xiii,
1-3) which enumerates the prophets and teachers in Antioch at the moment when it
was determined to carry the missions abroad, heads the list with the name of
Barnabas. [9] Him we may identify without hesitation as the Cypriote who had a
preponderant part in the evangelization of Antioch; while the fifth and last
name on the list is Saul-Paul, whom nobody would suspect of choosing the last
place for himself, but who filled it quite naturally after the others who
belonged to the group of founders. Barnabas, moreover, takes precedence of Paul
in the mission entrusted to them jointly by the community (xiii, 3).

</p>
<p>Interpret how we may the over-statements in the Epistle to
the Galatians, [10] it is certain that Saul-Paul did not make his entry on the
Christian stage as the absolute innovator, the autonomous and independent
missionary exhibited by this Epistle. The believers in Damascus to whom Paul
joined himself were zealous propagandists imbued with the spirit of Stephen, and
there is nothing whatever to suggest that he was out of his element among them.
Equally, lie was quite unaware at that time of possessing a peculiar Gospel or a
vocation on a different level from that of all the other Christian missionaries.
That idea he certainly did not bring with him to Antioch, where he found a
community which others had built up and which recruited non-Jews without
imposing circumcision. For long years [11] he remained there as the helper of
Barnabas rather than his chief. When the Jerusalem community took offence at
what was going on at Antioch, it was Barnabas and Paul, with Barnabas in front,
who went to plead the cause of liberty before the elders. Paul's only initiation
into the apostolate to the Gentiles was the initiation he received at Antioch by
the side of Barnabas. That apostolate was established before Paul appeared on
the scene and continued to be exercised by others at the same time as by him.
Paul was simply one of the greatest missionaries of the earliest period. In the
conventional histories of primitive

</p>
<p align="center">128

</p>
<p>Christianity he has eclipsed the true founders of the
hellenizing movement, as well as eclipsing Barnabas, who has almost been turned
into a modest companion of his missionary labours, like Timothy and Titus at a
later stage. But he owes this eminence far more to the exploitation of his
memory by one part of the Christian tradition, and to the writings that were
assigned to his name, than to any first-hand evidence of his apostolic activity
and its successes. The legend in Acts on the other hand, while magnifying him in
its own way, has unduly subordinated him, along with Barnabas, to the founders
of the first Christian community. Although edited Acts tell the story of his
conversion in detail [12] and has it twice told by Paul himself in speeches put
in his mouth, all that we can retain from this as certain is that Paul came from
Tarsus in Galicia and that suddenly, in consequence of a vision, he was
converted at Damascus to faith in the Christ whom he had previously opposed.
Paul's native country is not mentioned in the Epistles, but Tarsus is no
invention of the editor of Acts; it is even the most certain piece of
information he has left us concerning the antecedents of the great apostle. 

</p>
<p>We may believe in like manner that the apostle's Semitic
name was Saul and that the name Paul, always used in the Epistles, is a surname;
as it is probable that Paul was a Roman citizen the surname may be a cognomen.
Nothing is known of his family. Perhaps the trade of tentmaker, which we shall
find him following at Corinth in the house of Aquila, was learnt from his
father. There were flourishing schools at Tarsus, but there is nothing to prove
that Paul frequented them in his youth. By education he was a Pharisee, but the
editor of Acts is responsible for making him a disciple of Gamaliel, which he
never was; his culture was Jewish; he read the Scriptures in the Septuagint and
may have known Aramaic as the traditional speech of his family as well as from
his later travels. Needless to say our assessment of the influences to be
recognized as having moulded his thought depends on die credit we attach to the
Epistles. The gnostic ways of salvation to be met with in the great Epistles and
in Colossians and Philippians — not to speak of Ephesians — suggest many and
varied contacts with the mystical thought of the period. Retaining only what is
most probable, it seems that Paul was of Jewish culture and a Jew of strict
observance, but, with

</p>
<p align="center">129

</p>
<p>experience of life in a pagan environment, rendered capable
by that experience of embracing without repugnance the programme of
evangelization adopted by the missionaries of Antioch.

</p>
<p>The Book of Acts gives us the romance, not the psychology,
of his conversion. There is every reason to believe that Paul himself never
examined the process that led up to it and never analysed its motives; nor has
he described the vision which seems to have suddenly changed the orientation of
his being. [13] 

</p>
<p>The event took place at Damascus, but we have no knowledge
of what brought him to that city, nor do we know whether he had previously been
a zealous opponent of Christian groups elsewhere. He was never the general
commissioner in charge of an official persecution. He must have been a
Messianist, bewildered at first but afterwards gained over by what the followers
of Jesus had to tell of their Christ. The inner process which issued in his
conversion is not to be discerned either in the Epistles or in Acts. The
Epistles say nothing about it, although commentators have pretended, and often
still pretend, to discover it there. The editor of Acts has run the story of his
conversion into the conventional mould of miracle and interpreted it according
to the notion he is bent on giving of the providential mission to be assigned to
Paul. [14] That he stirred up the Jews in Damascus by preaching immediately
after his conversion, the Christ he had come to oppose is contradicted by
Galatians (cf. Acts ix, 20-22; Galatians i, 15-17) [15] which equally
contradicts the story of his setting out at once to Jerusalem to join the old
disciples and of his preaching there in the synagogues only to provoke a plot
from which he escapes again by flight. [16] As to the story of Barnabas,
departing under orders from the apostolic community, to meet Paul at Tarsus and
to bring him to Antioch, this is only another effort to exhibit Paul as an
auxiliary of considerable importance recruited and patronized by the Jerusalem
apostles. All these fictions must be set aside if the movement of primitive
evangelization is to recover its true physiognomy.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size=+1>1. FIRST IMPACTS OF THE GOSPEL ON THE PAGAN WORLD
</font>
</p>
<p>The author of Acts in its original form seems to have had
before him fairly precise information concerning the Jerusalem

</p>
<p align="center">130

</p>
<p>community, the foundation of the Antioch community and the
missions of Paul. The editor of our canonical book has not enlarged the
framework of the story; he has merely modified the contents, drowning them in
his legends about Peter and Paul, and arranging them to suit the needs of his
apologetic or to edify the Church. But missionary activity and the expansion of
the Christian religion vastly exceeded in reality the scope assigned to it in
Acts. In this respect the wholly fictitious scene of Pentecost, in its catalogue
of the Mediterranean peoples, may give us a truer idea of the work accomplished
during the first forty years of evangelization than can be gathered from the
subsequent narratives in the book.

</p>
<p>It is true that Acts gives summary information that the
Phoenician towns and Cyprus were evangelized before Antioch (xi, 19), but tells
us nothing whatever of how the preaching of the Christ came to Damascus so early
in the day. The most probable conjecture is that some of Stephen's companions
were able to reach that city; there is, however, the possibility that, when the
Hebrew group also finally embarked on propaganda outside Jerusalem, Jewish
Christianity may at once have thrown out casts in Palestine and found its way
into the neighbouring countries of Transjordania and Syria. Both Egypt and
&quot;the regions of Libya round about Cyrene&quot; are mentioned in the story
of Pentecost (ii, 10). Ought we not also to recall that a Cyrenian is said to
have carried the cross of Jesus to Golgotha? It is at least significant that
Jews of Cyrene figure at the side of Barnabas among the founders and teachers of
the Antioch community — Lucius of Cyrene and probably &quot;Simeon called the
Black&quot; (xiii, i).

</p>
<p>It is a reasonable conjecture that some believer in Cyrene
evangelized his own country. But the probability is very high that the faith of
Jesus, having once left Jerusalem and crossed the frontiers of Palestine,
quickly penetrated Egypt and found its way to Alexandria. Christian propaganda
does not seem to be aimed at in express terms in a letter addressed by Claudius
to the Alexandrians shortly after his accession, although many have thought the
letter condemns it; [17] but it is virtually impossible that Christian
propaganda was not active at that time, or soon afterwards, in Alexandrian
Jewry, and the more so in view of

</p>
<p align="center">131

</p>
<p>the contact of Stephen and his group with Jews of
Alexandria. [18]

</p>
<p>It is not until near the end of the second century, at the
time of the pascal controversy, that the Christian community of Alexandria makes
its appearance in history. But by then it had become of considerable importance
and fully formed; it had a great teacher, Clement, a profound and learned
mystic; it had behind it a long and, for us, extremely obscure past, of which
our chief knowledge is that it supplied the Christianity of that time with many
notable heretics. Although its origin must date back to the dawn of the
Christian religion, we are completely ignorant of how, when or by whom the
Gospel was carried into Egypt [19] and of the conditions under which it lived
and spread in that country. We have already indicated all that is known about
the Gospel of the Egyptians. In the highly syncretist atmosphere of Alexandria
Christianity seems to have taken a strong turn towards gnosticism. It is a
misfortune, doubtless attributable to that atmosphere, that the writings of the
Alexandrian gnostics of the second century have not come down to us, any more
than the Gospel of the Egyptians. The consequence is that Alexandrian
Christianity eludes the grasp of the historian until the time when it was caught
up in the general current of the catholic movement, into which the gnostic
crisis was later canalized and compressed.

</p>
<p>Similar observations apply to the Roman community.
&quot;When Paul wrote to it about the year 56 this community was not a thing of
yesterday; yet a quarter of a century earlier the Gospel propaganda had hardly
begun and must therefore have been carried to Rome in the earliest period of its
activity. An edict of Claudius against the Jews, issued under conditions obscure
to the historian, may have been occasioned by agitation provoked in Roman Jewry
by the preachers of the Christ. It seems that the edict came out in the early
years of his reign and was caused by the Christian propaganda; this it chiefly
aimed at repressing, but without restricting the liberty of the Jewish cult.
[20] Perhaps we may consider as probable the hypothesis that the Christian
propaganda was not of the inoffensive political character it affects in tht
writings of the New Testament, and that it led to serious messianic agitation in
the great Jewries, like that of Rome and especially that of Alexandria.

</p>
<p align="center">132

</p>
<p>Who were the first and real founders of the Roman
community? Certainly no important person from the first community in Jerusalem;
certainly not Peter; otherwise Paul in his letter to the Romans would have had
to pay regard to such notables and would not have been able to claim the field
as freely open to him. They must have been Christian Jews from Palestine,
hellenistic rather than Hebrew, who had not come to Rome for the sole purpose of
propaganda, but had none the less exercised it there both among the Roman Jews
and among the pagan frequenters of their synagogues; and with rapid success,
since the community<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>— or, more
exactly, the Christian groups in Rome — had attained considerable importance,
though as yet unable to claim that importance under any apostolic name.

</p>
<p>The time is long past when critics ought to have
recognized, or at least more deeply understood, that Christian propaganda was
not at first, and was not to become until more than one generation had passed, a
methodically conducted enterprise for the foundation of communities planned on a
model predetermined by the first missionaries, or even determined after the
lapse of several years. It was the kind of agitation that arises from personal
communication, one might call it a contagion, and remained so from the time when
Jesus began to preach till that of the Apocalypse. The promptitude with which
the propaganda was begun and its almost staggering success would be
inexplicable, though without being more miraculous than a world-epidemic, unless
we took into consideration the free outburst of enthusiasm which started the
first migration of the Gospel on its way, together with the whole assemblage of
conditions under which the preaching of the Gospel was born. As the fever of
extravagant hope cooled down, system and rule came in to the same measure.

</p>
<p>Let us never forget that the message which fired this hope
was at once urgent and easy to deliver; God and His Christ were on the point of
coming. Every Jew had an interest in knowing that. Is it likely that any Jew
would not be eager to hear of it? And those who carried the message, with a
simple-minded conviction of its truth, never doubted for a moment that
multitudes would be ready to believe them. Their faith gave them assurance of
success. Moreover the utmost alacrity was imperative for the sake

</p>
<p align="center">133

</p>
<p>of every man whom the message might reach; the Great Event
was bound to come suddenly and without warning: let every man then be ready. It
must be admitted, however, that some groups of Hebrew believers refused to treat
the message as an article for export, and represented Jesus as commanding his
missionaries not to go to the Samaritans nor to the pagans, because the Son of
Man would come before they had time to make the round of the cities of Israel
(Matt. x, 5, 23). Superfluous orders for propaganda already on the wing and
which nothing thereafter could stop!

</p>
<p>There is, however, no need to exaggerate the meaning of the
texts just quoted. They reflect the programme of the Judaizing party. They are
easily explained by saying that their authors were resolved to keep their
propaganda within the regions to which Jesus had confined his own activity. But,
from the fact that this programme is here turned into a precept of the Christ,
it does not follow that it was intended to make the example of Jesus into a
binding rule for all. We must first consider how the Great Event was understood.
Certain it is that the Judaizers were not bent on excluding all the Jews of the
Dispersion from the coming Kingdom of God; they believed that the accession of
the Dispersed to the Kingdom would be effectively brought about after, and as a
consequence of, the Event, which the original believers feverishly awaited from
day to day. On the other hand, the hellenistic believers, who proclaimed Jesus
as &quot;Lord&quot; had begun to preach the religion of the Christ also, and not
merely his imminent advent, and were early convinced that the message of this
religion ought to be carried at once to the Gentiles, and to all nations, since
faith in the Christ was, for all, an indispensable condition of entry into the
Kingdom. &quot;This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world as
a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come&quot; (Matt. xxiv, 14). As
the Second Coming did not take place the delay was explained by the necessity of
completing the world-wide proclamation of the Gospel. In any case, what was now
more and more aimed at was the gathering, in hope of his coming, of recruits to
the faith of the Christ who was acclaimed &quot;as a god.&quot; Thus understood,
the Kingdom of God was something very different from the enthronement of the
Messiah-King at Jerusalem, and came more 

</p>
<p align="center">134

</p>
<p>and more to be felt as already realized in the Christian
community.

</p>
<p>In this way the evangelical message was continually passed
on from one locality to the next in the Jewish colonies of all countries, where
it naturally gained a hearing and then came under discussion. It was not
accepted by all who heard it — how could it be? — but a certain number
received it as a hope imparted by contagion. To all appearance the Jewish
authorities were not as prompt in discrediting the propaganda as the Christian
missionaries were in spreading it. These authorities could not measure in
advance the harm which the propaganda was about to inflict upon Judaism. At
first they must have thought that the execution of Jesus would suffice to break
down the agitation which the Galilean preacher had started. The formation of the
Jewish-Christian community took them, so to speak, off their guard; they scented
no great peril in that. Disquieted, later, by the formation of the hellenistic
group and the preaching of Stephen, they reassured themselves by executing the
new preacher and by dispersing his associates. But this dispersion of the
hellenistic believers had also the effect of spreading their belief, and when
information came to the authorities of the growing success which the propagation
of it everywhere was achieving, they found themselves powerless to stop it. It
was doubtless at their instigation that King Agrippa I resolved to strike down
the leaders of the community holding on at Jerusalem. But Peter escaped. To set
the law in motion against the whole group of Hebrew believers would have been
too risky, while the hellenistic preaching was beyond the reach of violent
repression. Before the fall of Jerusalem in the year 70 it seems improbable that
the faith of Jesus was considered in any of the Jewries as altogether
incompatible with the profession of Judaism.

</p>
<p>Considered in itself the Gospel message appealed in the
main to simple souls, who awaited the day of the Lord in good faith, and to the
poor, who had need of its coming. Although the Christian movement was not,
strictly speaking, socialism coloured by religion, it had from the very
beginning and long continued to have, indeed has never altogether lost, die
character of a popular association which offered a promising asylum to the
disinherited classes of contemporary society, to the Jewish plebs,

</p>
<p align="center">135

</p>
<p>to the pagan plebs and to the pagan slaves. The
participation of the more fortunate classes was for a long time on a small
scale, but this favoured rather than hindered the organization of the new
religion as a vast mutual aid society, in which the unfortunate of all classes
found moral support and material help. In short, Christianity brought to its
adepts something more than an unrealizable hope continually frustrated. It
brought solace to great miseries, and led on to the founding of an equalitarian
society less crushing for the oppressed victims of the old civilizations.

</p>
<p>The expansion of the constituency of the new cult was
effected from the side where the synagogues themselves recruited proselytes more
or less complete but fairly numerous, that is, from the pagans. That
Christianity was able to make such remarkable progress in so short a time is due
to the fact that Judaism had previously spread itself over the entire
Mediterranean world, and that the synagogues had everywhere throughout the Roman
Empire, and even beyond, become centres of active propaganda. The missionaries
of Jesus made all haste to carry their message to the synagogues. Gaining them,
they came, almost without premeditation, into contact with the pagan proselytes,
and when the missionaries, after drawing away a large part of these, were driven
out of the synagogues, they addressed themselves directly to the pagans. This
first happened at Antioch and it must have repeated itself everywhere.

</p>
<p>Although Acts (xi, 19-21) give a highly summarized version
of the doings at Antioch, it leaves us with the certainty that the believers in
Jesus began by addressing themselves to Jews in the synagogues; that thereby
they made an impression on a few pagans friendly to Judaism, and were thus led
to recruit uncircumcised persons who were willing to hear their message. But, in
all this, there was no question of a rupture with the synagogue, doubtless
because the preachers had done nothing to provoke it, and also because the
spirit of the Antioch Jewry was not bigoted. (The protest against preaching the
Gospel to the Gentiles without requiring circumcision did not come from the Jews
of Antioch but from Judaizing believers sent there by Jerusalem.) No official
repudiation of the Christian propaganda was issued by the Jewish authorities
till long after the year 44;

</p>
<p align="center">136

</p>
<p>for we find that Paul, to all appearances, had been
everywhere able to present himself in the synagogues of Asia Minor, Macedonia
and Achaia without any ban being imposed from the outset on the reception of his
message, which was obstructed only by local reactions. When he was taken
prisoner in Jerusalem, his person was the object of attack. The Judaizing
Christians of the earliest community continued to be tolerated and to frequent
the temple, perhaps also the synagogues, without constituting a group separate
from traditional Judaism, as the hellenistic-Christians organized by Paul in
Asia Minor had by this time become.

</p>
<p>It may therefore be taken as certain that the Gospel would
have found no easy way out of Palestine if Judaism had not established colonies
in almost every part of the Roman Empire, and beyond it. Christian propaganda
would have taken no hold on the pagan world had not Judaism begun the conquest
of it in advance and initiated the pagans, to some extent, in the hope of the
Jews. But, Judaism being there, Christianity — a Jewish heresy — was enabled
to make its appearance at every centre of the ancient world where Judaism was
firmly rooted. In the environment where Judaism had won victories Christianity
won them also, and more easily. For the Gospel seemed to bring, and did bring,
the same hope, even a better hope, for it was on the way to fulfilment; at the
same time it dispensed adherents from Jewish observances repugnant to the habits
of the Greco-Roman world. With the way into pagan territory thus opened,
Christianity found there an immense clientele of the disinherited, to whom it
offered substantial help in their present misery, moral in the first instance
but material also, with the expectation of felicity in the coming age.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size=+1>2. THE HEADQUARTERS AT ANTIOCH</font>

</p>
<p>The texts before us make it possible to see how, when once
the Antioch community had been constituted, the propagation of the Gospel was
organized for the countries of Syria and Cilicia. Although the members, at least
the Jewish-Christian part of them, still frequented the synagogue, the community
had nevertheless a life of its own, but without breaking away from

</p>
<p align="center">137

</p>
<p>Judaism. Private meetings of believing groups for
instruction and for the Eucharist had, in Antioch, a greater importance than in
Jerusalem, because in the former there was no temple to serve as a common
meeting place for the pious Jews and followers of Jesus.

</p>
<p>Paul, in the Epistle to the Galatians, speaks of having
preached in Syria and Cilicia for at least ten years. [21] The following notice
in Acts (xiii, 1-2) concerning the initiative, taken by the Antioch community
for the preaching work in question, refers to the beginning of this period.

</p>
<p align="center">Now there were at Antioch,

<br>in the community of that place,

<br>prophets and preachers:

<br>(Joseph called) Barnabas (of Cyprus) [22] 

<br>Simeon called the Black

<br>and Lucius of Cyrene 

<br>Manaen, friend of Herod the tetrarch,

<br>and Saul (called Paul, of Tarsus). . . . 

<br>And as they worshipped the Lord and fasted,

<br>The Holy Spirit said:

<br>&quot;Separate me Barnabas and Saul

<br>to the work whereto I have called them.&quot;

</p>
<p>In the edited or canonical book of Acts this preamble
introduces a common and prolonged mission of Barnabas and Paul to Cyprus and
Asia Minor (xiii, 4-xiv) which is represented as taking place before the meeting
at Jerusalem which settled the question of the legal observances. But this
arrangement is contradicted both by the Epistle to the Galatians (cf. Gal. i,
21-ii, 1), which puts the Jerusalem meeting immediately after the mission into
Syria-Cilicia, and by Acts themselves (xv, 23) to which, in their account of the
meeting, the only hellenistic-Christian communities known are those of Syria-Cilicia.
Moreover, it seems impossible to place this mission, with E. Meyer (iii, 421)
and others, between the Jerusalem meeting and the subsequent conflict between
Peter and Paul at Antioch, after which Paul, now separated from BarnaLas,
followed his personal inspirations only. Far more probably the Cyprus mission
was undertaken by Barnabas alone after this separation, and the mission to
Lycaonia and Galatia by Paul alone on the same occasion; the editor of Acts
having

</p>
<p align="center">138

</p>
<p>thought well to combine these two missions into one, and to
anticipate certain events in each of the two in the common mission he proceeds
to imagine. [23]

</p>
<p>The text just cited, then, concerns a mission of which the
story is not told in canonical Acts. It can only be that of which the whole
credit seems to be attributed to Paul in the Epistle to the Galatians. In fact
our text supposes the mission to have been carried out under conditions very
different from those implied by the Epistle. Following the latter, one might
think that Paul set forth entirely alone in order to carry out a programme laid
down by himself at the time of his conversion. We here see that he did nothing
of the kind. At a meeting of the congregation, assembled, we must suppose, in
the name of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit, doubtless with one of the prophets for
spokesman, commands the congregation to make provision for the support of two
missionaries, whose whole time is to be devoted to making converts, both in
Antioch itself and especially in the neighbouring regions of Syria and Cilicia.
The two missionaries selected were evidently the two judged to be most gifted
for this kind of service, the first being Barnabas who heads the list of
prophet-teachers as chief founders of the Antioch congregation, the second being
Paul, the last on the list as having been admitted to the congregation when it
was already founded, but whose zeal and gifts as a maker of converts had
speedily won recognition.

</p>
<p>It is not very difficult to see how the decision to
undertake the mission came about. When the community had grown, through the
adhesion of new recruits, to fairly large proportions, though the apostolic
office had as yet no definite form, it became obvious that the time was ripe to
organize teaching, for the furtherance of propaganda, by delegating it to those
best fitted for that employment. Now the Antioch congregation was well furnished
in this respect, having five &quot;prophets and teachers.&quot; 

</p>
<p>To support the home propaganda, in the conditions under
which this had been carried on hitherto, half of the total force would be
enough, while the most active, enterprising and — may we guess? — the
youngest could then be more usefully employed on outside work. For various
reasons Barnabas and Paul were the likely candidates for a travelling mission.
Both of them, moreover, and Paul especially, were acquainted with the region

</p>
<p align="center">139

</p>
<p>in which their zeal was to be exercised; the purpose being
to radiate outwards from Antioch and as far as Cilicia — Paul's country of
origin.

</p>
<p>We can only conjecture how the Antioch community attained
the degree of development at which we find it when the apostolic expedition of
Barnabas and Paul was set on foot. To begin with, a few Jews would be won over
by the fugitives from Jerusalem; then the Cypriots and the Cyrenians —
Barnabas, Simeon the Black and Lucius — would recruit a certain number of
uncircumcised proselytes to Judaism, whom they found attached to the synagogues.
Since the synagogues had accepted them without demanding circumcision our new
preachers would do the same, and would have little scruple in doing so if they
thought, as Stephen did, that in the Reign of the Christ the non-moral
observances of the Law would be swept away. So they confined themselves to
baptizing their uncircumcised converts before admitting them to fellowship, just
as they also baptized the circumcised Jews. For the rest, we may conjecture that
at Antioch, as at Jerusalem, the new believers, while perhaps continuing to
frequent the synagogues, would in addition have meetings of their own,
especially in the form of meals for the solemn breaking of bread in memory of
Jesus, and in celebration of his approaching advent. Assuming that complete
separation from the synagogue was not soon effected — and it is probable that
the bond was not broken for a considerable time — the final result is that the
new community would have a life of its own and, we may add, its own meetings for
worship, as we are in effect told it had.

</p>
<p>In these meetings at Antioch strange phenomena were
produced which can hardly have been forthcoming at Jerusalem in the same degree
or in the same form. For the scene at Pentecost described in Acts is entirely
fictitious; so too is what the same book has to tell us elsewhere about
&quot;speaking with tongues&quot; (ii, 1-13; x, 46; xix, 6). Moreover there is
no evidence of prophets or inspired teachers appearing in Jerusalem, except
casually in stories of secondary origin and poor credibility (xi, 27-30). [24] 

</p>
<p>At Antioch instructors in doctrine were regarded as endowed
by the Spirit with the gift of Knowledge, and as able, on occasion, to deliver
true oracles under the Spirit's dictation, as happened

</p>
<p align="center">140

</p>
<p>in the case of the mission entrusted to Barnabas and Paul.
There seems to be no ground for dividing the list of the five &quot;prophets and
teachers&quot; into two parts, as if the first two or three had been
&quot;prophets&quot; and the others &quot;teachers.&quot; A prophet does not
prophesy without intermission. The same individual who at exceptional times
seemed to be speaking to the direct dictation of the Spirit would, in ordinary
times, deliver his teaching with its help and presence, that is, under the
simple inspiration of his faith, but without emotional transports. Conversely,
there were few teachers at this time who had not, at certain conjunctions, their
moments of trance and prophetic revelation. In the case before us the suggestion
which pointed to Barnabas and Paul was obviously the outcome of circumstances,
and it matters little to know by the mouth of which prophet it was uttered,
though we may be sure it did not come from either of the two persons interested.

</p>
<p>It would no doubt be somewhat risky to assume that the
spiritual gifts, which play so large a part in the history of primitive
Christianity, were not first manifested at Jerusalem but had their beginning at
Antioch. Mystical and visionary exaltation infectiously communicated is
contemporary with faith in Christ risen from the dead, and helped to fortify it,
the disposition to yield to it being strengthened by anxious expectation of the
parousia. But Antioch may well have marked a stage onwards in the evolution of
this mysticism, the stage of prophetical teaching, which is not said to have
accompanied the delirious &quot;speaking with tongues.&quot; Incomplete as our
documentary evidence may be, it is an important fact that the Antioch community
was organized under the direction of teaching prophecy.

</p>
<p>Not less important to note at this point is the way in
which the apostolate was instituted under the form of a delegation. Barnabas and
Paul are teaching prophets at Antioch whom the community, at the suggestion of
the Spirit — the Christ-Spirit — delegates for a mission abroad. This
delegation clearly makes them &quot;apostles,&quot; that is to say envoys of the
community which had given them the mission at the bidding of the Spirit of
Christ. &quot;The work&quot; referred to is a real or genuine apostolic mission,
its significance as such being underlined for the sole reason that it was, at
least in the writer's thought, the first of its kind;

</p>
<p align="center">141

</p>
<p>an enterprise declared to be necessary in the name of
Christ at a meeting of believers, and entrusted to delegates whom the community,
while accompanying them with its prayers, provides with letters of
recommendation, with money, and all else needful for the journey. Otherwise such
expeditions would not have been possible. The passage before us, then (xiii,
1-2), is an account of the first institution of the travelling apostolate, the
narrator being fully aware of it as such, as well as of the close collaboration
of Barnabas and Paul for several years, a collaboration which the Epistle to the
Galatians tends to disguise. A commission from the community to which the
traveller belonged, with a contribution to the expenses of his journey, leaving
the rest of his entertainment to his prospective converts, was a normal feature
in the constitution of the primitive apostolate.

</p>
<p>We lack the details of the preaching tours made by Barnabas
and Paul in the regions of Syria and Cilicia. [25] All we know of it are the
results. Several Christian groups were formed in these countries under the same
conditions as those at Antioch. They were partly recruited from the pagans, so
that now there were many communities, using the name of Jesus and sharing the
Jewish hope, in which adherents were to be found who had not submitted to the
obligations of the Jewish cult.

</p>
<p>One may well ask whether the Antioch missionaries had
weighed the consequences of what may perhaps be called their liberalism. No
doubt the two envoys conformed to the broader tendencies of Judaism as observed
in the Dispersion, putting the essentials of religion in a belief in the One God
and in the salvation promised by him to Israel subject to observance of the
Jewish moral law. These tendencies would be in agreement with the opinion
attributed to Stephen regarding the abrogation, in the final economy of the
Kingdom, of the material observances required by the Mosaic ritual. We may
believe further that they had some sense, perhaps confused, of the great
opportunities which the abandonment of these practices could not fail to bring
for their propaganda. But neither could they disguise from themselves that these
easy-going ways would give rise to opposition, and they would need to have their
answer ready. What they probably did not suspect nor aim to bring about was
that, in reality, they were laying the foundation of a new religion

</p>
<p align="center">142

</p>
<p>and that soon, in consequence of their exertions, the faith
of Christ, the religion of Jesus would be separated for ever, and immediately,
from Judaism.

</p>
<p align="center"><font size=+1>3. PAUL BREAKS WITH ANTIOCH</font>

</p>
<p>Between the new community at Antioch, with its offshoots,
and the community at Jerusalem, the first and chief centre of the faith, there
existed relations, just as there were relations between the Judaism of the
Dispersion and the metropolis of all the Jews. It was not very long before the
saints in Jerusalem began to be alarmed by the news that groups were being
formed in Syria and Cilicia of persons more or less strangers to Judaism
inasmuch as they were outside its ritual economy. The problem which the
liberalism of the Antioch missionaries had found so easy of solution did not
seem so simple to the Hebrew believers of the original community. How, they
asked, could the promises be inherited by those who bore not the mark of the
chosen people, by those who were not partners in the holy covenant with its
ritual conditions fixed by revelation direct from God? Perhaps the chiefs of the
community hesitated to pronounce judgment in the matter, the teaching of Jesus,
so far as there was any to refer to, having never touched this problem, nor
furnished a principle for its solution. At an early hour in the development of
primitive Christianity, Jesus was represented as having predicted the accession
of the Gentiles to the Kingdom, and even as having realized it symbolically by
miracles performed at the request of the Canaanite woman and of the centurion at
Capernaum. But he was not made to declare that circumcision and the other
observances were of no value for salvation. The Judaizers made him say the flat
contrary and openly declare that he had not come to abrogate the Law (Matthew v,
17-19).

</p>
<p>There were, however, some zealous individuals, more or less
imbued with the pharisaic spirit, who pronounced against the practice of the
Antioch missionaries and took upon themselves the duty of travelling to that
city and catechizing the proselytes, explaining to them that salvation was
impossible unless the Law of Moses was observed. [26] Perhaps the Jewish
believers in Antiocli were easily shaken; but the hellenistic

</p>
<p align="center">143

</p>
<p>believers resisted, and their chiefs refused to yield to
the injunctions of Judaizing extremists. By way of putting an end to the trouble
the community resolved to send a delegation which would go into the matter with
the elders in Jerusalem. Paul in the Epistle to the Galatians gives us to
understand that this step was taken under orders from the Spirit (ii, 2), [27]
the text describing it, however, as a private revelation in consequence of which
Paul decided to betake himself to Jerusalem. But the thing happened quite
differently. There was no question either of the affairs or of the doctrines
peculiar to this apostle. Either Paul, after the event, immensely exaggerated
his own importance in it, making the whole negotiation centre on himself, and
claiming as his personal inspiration the step taken by the community, under
injunction of the Spirit, in delegating, not Paul alone, but Barnabas first and
Paul second — either this, or the text, written in eulogy of Paul, is
apocryphal. The Epistle also mentions a certain Titus, an uncircumcised
believer, as having been chosen by Paul himself as his companion. If Titus
really accompanied the delegates, he too may have been appointed by the
community. 

</p>
<p>The journey probably took place towards the end of the year
43. Agrippa I died in the course of 44; Peter fled from Jerusalem in the spring
of that year; the apostolic meeting took place some time previously.

</p>
<p>The problem was not settled without a clash of argument.
Reading the Epistle to the Galatians one might think that Paul and his doctrines
were the sole matters in the debate. In fact the whole work of the Antioch
missionaries, which had not been started by Paul himself, was in question. At
the general meetings of the community little was spoken of beyond the results
obtained by the missionaries. But Barnabas and Paul had long private audiences
with the chiefs, of whom the Epistle mentions Peter, John and James —
according to the context not the brother of John, but James the brother of the
Lord. [28] To them the Antioch apostles gave their reasons and defended their
practice. The elders of Jerusalem were at last convinced. If we could believe
what the Epistle to the Galatians has to say of the matter (ii, 7-9) it would
seem that the &quot;pillars&quot; recognized in Paul a unique and universal
vocation as apostle to the Gentiles and a parallel vocation for Peter as apostle
to the circumcision.

</p>
<p align="center">144

</p>
<p>Nothing could be less probable than such a convention. The
book of Acts has no suspicion of its having ever existed. Either, then, Paul
immensely overstates his own importance in describing his providential mission,
or the text is not authentic. The elders of Jerusalem were hardly more capable
of claiming for themselves alone the evangelization of all the Jews in the world
than they were of confiding to Paul alone the evangelization of all the
Gentiles. Such a division would have been an outrage upon common sense. To
render it more acceptable Edouard Meyer arbitrarily supposes that the Jerusalem
believers, not knowing Greek, confined themselves to the evangelization of the
Jews in Palestine and left all the other countries in the world to the
hellenists. This in fact is what happened, but is not what the text of the
Epistle means. [29] The debate was not aimed at the theoretical object of
determining the vocation of the chief apostles and their respective spheres of
influence, a problem both abstract and retrospective. From beginning to end the
one question at issue was whether or no salvation could be assured to the
uncircumcised by virtue alone of faith in God and His Christ Jesus, along with a
change of heart and observance of the Jewish moral law, but without circumcision
and the ritual practices obligatory for Jews by birth. This was the only
question examined and it was so important in itself that to seek another theme
for the debate in the personalities that were parties to it is a gratuitous
expenditure of effort. On this, the only point at issue, the Jerusalem elders
finally came to terms with the Antioch missionaries. This, doubtless, was done
the more easily because Jewish opinion on the necessity of circumcision for the
salvation of proselytes had not been at that time determined. The Galilean
believers, moreover, cannot have been very deeply versed in the problems of
theology. At this period they seem to have had no thought of leaving Palestine,
nor even Jerusalem, and to have willingly given consent that others should carry
the Gospel to the outside world, whether Jewish or Gentile, and under the
conditions which the Antioch missionaries had adopted. Their sole request was
the preachers to the countries of the Dispersion should not forget &quot;the
poor&quot; — that is, the Jerusalem community, where material poverty was
common enough. The help thus to be given was doubtless understood as a sign of 

</p>
<p align="center">145

</p>
<p>communion, not to say as a kind of allegiance.
Notwithstanding the story in Acts (xv, 13-20) [30] it may be doubted whether the
arrangement carried other conditions, such as the interdiction of blood and of
&quot;things strangled.&quot; But it is morally certain that the general picture
in Acts reflects the real practice, that of a compromise adopted in mixed
congregations to allay the scruples of Jewish believers, and sanctioned from the
outset by apostolic authority. What the chiefs had decided the Jerusalem
community accepted, and letters were written disavowing the disturbers of the
peace at Antioch; they were carried by two notables of Jerusalem, Judas
Barsabbas and Silas who accompanied the Antioch delegation on the return
journey. Thus the danger of division at the moment when the Christian religion
was in process of being born was averted, and the continuation of the propaganda
on pagan soil assured. But the external peace enjoyed by the Jerusalem
congregation was about to pass through a time of trouble; while the agreement
reached by the missionaries was soon, by the action of Paul, to be shattered
also.

</p>
<p>In the years when these things were happening the old
Kingdom of Herod the Great was provisionally reconstituted for the benefit of
Herod Agrippa the First, a dependant of the Emperor Claudius, and previously the
friend of Caligula. This prince, after a life of many adventures and of mediocre
edification, thought to win the favour of his subjects by putting on grand airs
of piety. [31] Like the procurators, he resided by preference at Caesarea, but
coming to Jerusalem for the Passover in the year 44 he made it his duty to
persecute the heads of the Christian congregation. It is possible that the
decision to do this was not entirely his own, but was made in response to
solicitation from the Jewish ecclesiastical authorities. Since his reign began
in 41 it may, however, be asked why had not the priests and the Sanhedrim made
an earlier appeal to him? Perhaps the success of the Christian propaganda
outside Palestine was beginning at last to alarm them, and it may even be that
the Antioch affair, and the solution in which it resulted, had come to their
knowledge and caused them particular irritation. [32] There is also the further
possibility that the attitude of Agrippa may have been determined by that of
Claudius towards Jewish agitation. For the rest, it is to be noted that action
was not taken against the congregation

</p>
<p align="center">146

</p>
<p>as a whole, nor against James the brother of Jesus, who
enjoyed a great reputation for fidelity to the Law. To begin with, the two sons
of Zebedee, James and John, were arrested and put to death, probably after trial
by the Sanhedrim. [33]

</p>
<p>Peter was the next to be seized and, the time of the
Passover having come, was thrown into prison to await his trial at the
conclusion of the solemnities; but he made his escape under conditions which the
book of Acts represents as wholly miraculous, and of which the least to be said
is that the romancer and the dramatist have been hard at work (xii, 3-19). The
alternatives seem to be that either he took to flight under the menace of arrest
and that pains have been taken to cover up his inglorious retreat, or else some
influential person found means to get him out of prison, and the incident became
dramatized as a miracle. In either event he left Jerusalem in haste and in all
probability never returned. But whither did he go? The editor of Acts is
deliberately silent about the locality to which he betook himself, and for a
twofold reason; first, because his purpose was to ignore the conflict between
Peter and Paul; and, second, because by postponing the discussion about legal
observances till after the events just related, he made it impossible to bring
Peter, whom he supposes to have reached the solution of the problems at the
conversion of Cornelius, on to the ground where the discussion had its birth. It
may be that Peter left the city accompanied by John-Mark [34] and by Silas.[35]
Palestine, now almost entirely under the rule of Herod Agrippa, being no safe
place for him, he betook himself to Antioch.

</p>
<p>Then arose the conflict which was to lead Paul on a road
all his own and to wholly new fields for the proclamation of his Gospel. If we
are to believe the Epistle to the Galatians (ii, 11-13) Peter found the Antioch
community at peace under the recent decision of Jerusalem, and lived in the city
for some time, participating without scruple, among the uncircumcised believers,
in the meals where bread was broken in memory of the Lord Jesus. But soon there
arrived certain emissaries from James who were scandalized by this promiscuous
association of the circumcised and the uncircumcised. Save for indications in
the Epistle to the Galatians, which are open to suspicion, there is no evidence
that these emissaries attempted to cancel the Jerusalem decision

</p>
<p align="center">147

</p>
<p>and force circumcision on pagan converts. Their intention
was to make it clear that the Jewish believers ought not to evade the
obligations of the Jewish Law as interpreted in Pharisaic tradition. As they had
on their side a little logic and a good deal of hereditary fanaticism, Peter
gave way to their reproaches; so did the other circumcised believers; so, too,
even Barnabas seems to have done, thinking no doubt that separation of
circumcised and uncircumcised at meal times was preferable to schism between
Antioch and Jerusalem on a matter of secondary importance.

</p>
<p>Paul judged otherwise, and, if we may believe the Epistle
to the Galatians, [36] lost his temper, denouncing Peter and the other Jewish
believers as hypocrites, Barnabas included. He accused them roundly of being
false to the Gospel, charging Peter in particular with attempting, in
contravention of the Jerusalem agreement, to force circumcision on the Gentiles.
The accusation, if it was ever made, seems to have had no foundation in fact.
Barnabas, who had no thought of betraying the principle he had followed in
evangelizing the pagans, did not change. Christian propaganda went on as before
without imposition of the legal observances. It was largely owing to the absence
of any such condition that it continued to succeed on the one hand and, on the
other, that official Judaism was finally brought to the point of condemning it.
We do not know whether Peter and Barnabas submitted indefinitely to the pressure
of the Judaizers in governing their relations with the pagan converts. It is
improbable. We may suppose that a compromise was soon effected — the very
compromise in fact which the editor of Acts puts into the discourse of James and
the apostolic decree for allaying the scruples of the Judaizers (xv, 20, 28-29).

</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Galatians does not inform us what the
sequel was to the controversy raised by Paul. [37] But it may be conjectured
from the situation of which the Epistles, that to the Galatians to begin with,
give us a glimpse. In that Epistle we see Paul isolated, proud of his isolation,
and glorying in the consciousness of a unique vocation for which his isolation
is, as it were, the natural price he has to pay. He sees himself, and describes
himself, as pursued by unrelenting hostility, which he takes pains to discredit
by attributing it to a difference of opinion about the essential principles of
salvation and to certain

</p>
<p align="center">148

</p>
<p>unworthy intentions, but which we may suspect was mainly
personal, caused by the way in which Paul had created solely for himself a
schism from the other missionaries. But the question still remains for us of how
far the view of the matter thus disclosed corresponds to the reality. If account
be taken of the Epistle only, Paul is never again to be found in the relations
of fraternal communion, existing up to the time of the Antioch quarrel, with
Barnabas, with Peter or with other leading figures of the Christian propaganda,
whoever they may have been. But, though Paul's independent turn of mind made him
seek a field for his apostleship where he would have no competitors, there is no
evidence that the communities founded by him formed a dissenting group, or even
that there was a final breach between him and the authentic representatives of
Judaizing Christianity. Just as he went to Jerusalem with Barnabas to obtain
guarantees for the communities in Syria and Cilicia on the principle of freedom
from circumcision, so later on we find him a second time in presence of the
mother-community — this time with a collection taken up from his converts, as
though with object of obtaining recognition from the Jerusalem leaders of the
work he had accomplished all alone. But it may well be that confidence was not
complete on either side, though matters were not yet at the pitch of anathema
and excommunication.

</p>
<p>Our canonical book of Acts is deliberately circumspect
about the whole of this affair and firmly resolved to say nothing of the
difficulties Paul had to encounter later in consequence of his separation from
the other Christian missionaries. It confines itself to falsifying the true
motive which prevented Barnabas and Paul, returned to Antioch after their
journey to Jerusalem, from continuing to preach together as hitherto they had
been doing. Barnabas is made to express a wish that Paul and he should be
accompanied by John-Mark on a projected mission to the South of Asia Minor. Paul
not wanting this companion, a lively contention then arises between the two
which comes to such a pass that Barnabas goes off to Cyprus with John-Mark, and
Paul to Asia Minor with Silas. The two departures, which we must suppose to have
been almost simultaneous, belong, no doubt, to history. But the circumstances
which led to them were not those indicated by the book of Acts. [38]

</p>
<p align="center">149

</p>
<p>For different reasons the two missionaries judged it best
to abandon the Antioch community which for many years had been the centre of
their apostolic activity. Barnabas, certainly, might have stayed there. But
perhaps, after the quarrel that had just arisen, he preferred to deliver the
Gospel message in Cyprus, his native country, whither he had probably fled after
the dispersion of Stephen's followers, but where he did not remain very long (xi,
19-20). If one may believe the Epistle to the Colossians, John-Mark was his
nephew (Col. iv, 10); while according to Acts the house of Mary, John-Mark's
mother, was a place of rendezvous for the Jerusalem believers. [39] 

</p>
<p>It was to this house that Peter came, after his escape from
prison, to bid them farewell on departing for Antioch. Of what Barnabas
accomplished in Cyprus we know nothing, and can only presume that this true
apostle, whose action was so decisive in carrying the Gospel to the pagan world,
continued to labour fruitfully in the work he had been the first to set on foot.
Tradition has pitched upon him as author of the Epistle to the Hebrews and of
the so-called Epistle of Barnabas. But his real work was of greater value than
Epistles or any treatise in theology. As to John-Mark, he was an evangelical
worker of the second rank whose relations with Peter [40] made his name useful
as a commendatory title for the oldest of the canonical Gospels.</p>
