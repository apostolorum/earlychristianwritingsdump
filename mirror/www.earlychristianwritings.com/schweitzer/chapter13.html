<center><h2>RENAN</h2></center>
<P>
<i>Ernest Renan</i>. La Vie de Jesus. 1863. Paris, Michel Levy Freres. 462 pp.<BR>
<i>E. de Pressense</i>. Jesus-Christ, son temps, sa vie, son ceuvre. Paris, 1865. 684 pp.
<P>
ERNEST RENAN WAS BORN IN 1823 AT TREGUIER IN BRITTANY. INTENDED
for the priesthood, he entered the seminary of St. Sulpice in Paris, but
there, in consequence of reading the German critical theology, he began
to doubt the truth of Christianity and of its history. In October 1845,
shortly before the time arrived for him to be ordained a sub-deacon, he
left the seminary and began to work for his living as a private teacher.
In 1849 he received a government grant to enable him to make a
journey to Italy for the prosecution of his studies, the fruits of which
appeared in his Averroes et I'Averroisme (Paris, 1852) ; in 1856 he
was made a member of the Academic des Inscriptions; in 1860 he received from Napoleon III. the means to make a journey to Phoenicia
and Syria. After his return in 1862 he obtained the professorship of
Semitic Languages at the College de France. But the widespread indignation aroused by his Life of Jesus, which appeared in the following
year, forced the Government to remove him from his office. He refused
a post as Librarian of the Imperial Library, and lived in retirement
until the Republic of 1871 restored him to his professorship. In politics,
as in religion, his position was somewhat indefinite. In religion he was
no longer a Catholic; avowed free-thought was too plebeian for his taste,
and in Protestantism the multiplicity of sects repelled him. Similarly
in politics, in the period immediately following the fall of the Empire,
he was in turn Royalist, Republican, and Bonapartist. At bottom he was
a sceptic. He died in 1892, already half-forgotten by the public; until
his imposing funeral and interment in the Pantheon recalled him to its
memory.
<P>
Like Strauss, Renan designed his Life of Jesus to form part of a
complete account of the history and dogma of the early Church. His
purpose, however, was purely historical; it was no part of his project
to set up, on the basis of the history, a new system of dogma, as Strauss
had desired to do. This plan was not only conceived, but carried out.
<P>
<center>181</center>
<P>
<i>Les Apotres</i> appeared in 1866; <i>St. Paul</i> in 1869; <i>L'Ante-Christ</i> in 1873;
<i>Les Evangiles</i> in 1877; <i>L'Eglise chretienne</i> in 1879; <i>Marc-Aurele et la
fin du monde antique</i> in 1881. Several of these works were more valuable than the one which opened the series, but for the world Renan
continued to be the author of the <i>Vie de Jesus</i>, and of that alone.
<P>
He planned the work at Gaza, and he dedicated it to his sister Henriette,
who died soon after, in Syria, and lies buried at Byblus.
<P>
This was the first Life of Jesus for the Catholic world, which had
scarcely been touched—the Latin peoples least of all—by the two and
a half generations of critical study which had been devoted to the
subject. It is true, Strauss's work had been translated into French, [1] but
it had made only a passing stir, and that only among a little circle of
intellectuals. Now came a writer with the characteristic French mental
accent, who gave to the Latin world in a single book the result of the
whole process of German criticism.
<P>
But Renan's work marked an epoch, not for the Catholic world only,
but for general literature. He laid the problem which had hitherto occupied only theologians before the whole cultured world. And not as
a problem, but as a question of which he, by means of his historical
science and aesthetic power of reviving the past, could provide a solution. He offered his readers a Jesus who was alive, whom he, with his
artistic imagination, had met under the blue heaven of Galilee, and
whose lineaments his inspired pencil had seized. Men's attention was
arrested, and they thought to see Jesus, because Renan had the skill to
make them see blue skies, seas of waving corn, distant mountains, gleaming lilies, in a landscape with the Lake of Gennesareth for its centre, and
to hear with him in the whispering of the reeds the eternal melody of
the Sermon on the Mount.
<P>
Yet the aesthetic feeling for nature which gave birth to this Life of
Jesus was, it must be confessed, neither pure nor profound. It is a standing enigma why French art, which in painting grasps nature with a
directness and vigour, with an objectivity in the best sense of the word,
such as is scarcely to be found in the art of any other nation, has in
poetry treated it in a fashion which scarcely ever goes beyond the
lyrical and sentimental, the artificial, the subjective, in the worst sense
of the word. Renan is no exception to this rule, any more than Lamartine
or Pierre Loti. He looks at the landscape with the eye of a decorative
painter seeking a motif for a lyrical composition upon which he is engaged. But that was not noticed by the many, because they, after all,
were accustomed to have nature dressed up for them, and had had their
taste so corrupted by a certain kind of lyricism that they had lost the
<P>
[1] <i>La Vie de Jesus de D. Fr. Strauss</i>. Traduite par M. Littre, 1840.
<P>
<center>182</center>
<P>
power of distinguishing between truth and artificiality. Even those who
might have noticed it were so astonished and delighted at being shown
Jesus in the Galilaean landscape that they were content to yield to the
enchantment.
<P>
Along with this artificial feeling for nature a good many other things
were accepted without question. There is scarcely any other work on
the subject which so abounds in lapses of taste—and those of the most
distressing kind—as Renan's <i>Vie de Jesus</i>. It is Christian art in the
worst sense of the term—the art of the wax image. The gentle Jesus,
the beautiful Mary, the fair Galilaeans who formed the retinue of the
"amiable carpenter," might have been taken over in a body from the
shop-window of an ecclesiastical art emporium in the Place St. Sulpice.
Nevertheless, there is something magical about the work. It offends
and yet it attracts. It will never be quite forgotten, nor is it ever likely
to be surpassed in its own line, for nature is not prodigal of masters of
style, and rarely is a book so directly born of enthusiasm as that which
Renan planned among the Galilaean hills.
<P>
The essay on the sources of the Life of Jesus with which it opens is
itself a literary masterpiece. With a kind of effortless ease he makes
his readers acquainted with the criticism of Strauss, of Baur, of Reuss,
of Colani. He does not argue, but simply sets the result vividly before
the reader, who finds himself at once at home in the new world of ideas.
He avoids any hard or glaring effects; by means of that skilful transition from point to point which Wagner in one of his letters praises as
the highest art, everything is surrounded with atmosphere. But how
much trickery and illusion there is in this art! In a few strokes he indicates the relation of John to the Synoptists; the dilemma is made clear,
it seems as if one horn or the other must be chosen. Then he begins by
artful touches to soften down the contrast. The discourses of John are
not authentic; the historical Jesus cannot have spoken thus. But what
about the statements of fact? Here Renan declares himself convinced
by the graphic presentment of the passion story. Touches like "it was
night," "they had lighted a fire of coals," "the coat was without seam,"
cannot have been invented. Therefore the Gospel must in some way go
back to the disciple whom Jesus loved. It is possible, nay certain, that
when as an old man he read the other Gospels, he was displeased by
certain inaccuracies, and perhaps vexed that he was given so small a
place in the history. He began to dictate a number of things which he
had better means of knowing than the others; partly, too, with the
purpose of showing that in many cases where Peter only had been mentioned he also had played a part, and indeed the principal part. Sometimes his recollection was quite fresh, sometimes it had been modified
by time. When he wrote down the discourses, he had forgotten the Lake
<P>
<center>183</center>
<P>
of Gennesareth and the winsome words which he had listened to upon
its shores. He was now living in quite a different world. The events of
the year 70 destroyed his hopes of the return of his Master. His Jewish
prejudices fell away, and as he was still young, he adapted himself to
the syncretistic, philosophic, gnostic environment amid which he found
himself in Ephesus. Thus even Jesus' world of thought took on a new
shape for him; although the discourses are perhaps rather to be referred
to his school than to himself. But, when all is said, John remains the
best biographer. Or, to put it more accurately, while all the Gospels are
biographies, they are legendary biographies, even though they come
down from the first century. Their texts need interpretation, and the
cine to the interpretation can be supplied by aesthetic feeling. They must
be subjected to a gentle pressure to bring them together, and make them
coalesce into a unity in which all the data are happily combined.
<P>
How this is to be done Renan shows later in his description of the
death of Jesus. "Suddenly," he says, "Jesus gave a terrible cry in which
gome thought they heard 'Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,'
but which others, whose thoughts were running on the fulfilment of
prophecy, reported as 'It is finished.'"
<P>
The authentic sayings of Jesus are more or less self-evidencing. Coming in contact with one of them amid the welter of heterogeneous traditions, you feel a thrill of recognition. They leap forth and take their
proper place, where their vivid power becomes apparent. For one who
writes the life of Jesus on His native soil, the Gospels are not so much
sources of information as incentives to revelation. "I had," Renan
avows, "a fifth Gospel before my eyes, mutilated in parts, but still
legible, and taking it for my guide I saw behind the narratives of Matthew and Mark, instead of an ideal Being of whom it might be maintained that He had never existed, a glorious human countenance full of
life and movement." It is this Jesus of the fifth Gospel that he desires
to portray.
<P>
In looking at the picture, the reader must not allow the vexed question of miracle to distract him and disturb the proper frame of mind.
The author refuses to assert either the possibility or the impossibility
of miracle, but speaks only as an historian. "We do not say miracle is
impossible, we say only that there has never been a satisfactorily authenticated miracle."
<P>
In view of the method of treatment adopted by Renan there can, of
course, be no question of an historical plan. He brings in each saying
at the point where it seems most appropriate. None of them is passed
over, but none of them appears in its historical setting. He shifts individual incidents hither and thither in the most arbitrary fashion. For
example, the coming of Jesus' mother to seek Him (in the belief that
<P>
<center>184</center>
<P>
He is beside Himself) must belong to the later part of Jesus' life, since
it is out of tone with the happy innocence of the earlier period. Certain
scenes are transposed from the later period to the earlier, because they
are not gloomy enough for the later time. Others again are made the
basis of an unwarranted generalisation. It is not enough that Jesus once
rode upon an ass while the disciples in the intoxication of joy cast their
garments in the way: according to Renan, He constantly rode about
even in Galilee, upon a mule, "that favourite riding-animal of the East
which is so docile and sure-footed and whose great dark eyes, shaded
by long lashes, are full of gentleness." Sometimes the disciples surrounded Him with rustic pomp, using their garments by way of carpeting. They laid them upon the mule which carried Him, or spread them
before Him on the way.
<P>
Scenes of little significance are sometimes elaborately described by
Renan while more important ones are barely touched on. "One day,
indeed," he remarks in describing the first visit to Jerusalem, "anger
seems to have, as the saying goes, overmastered Him; He struck some
of the miserable chatterers with the scourge, and overthrew their
tables." Such is the incidental fashion in which the cleansing of the
temple was brought in. In this way it is possible to smuggle in a miracle
without giving any further explanation of it. The miracle at Cana is
brought, by means of the following unobtrusive turn of phrase, into
the account of the period of success in Galilee. "One of His miracles
was done by Jesus for the sole purpose of increasing the happiness of
a wedding-party in a little country town."
<P>
This Life of Jesus is introduced by a kind of prelude. Jesus had been
living in Galilee before He came to the Baptist; when He heard of the
latter's success He went to him with His little company of followers.
They were both young, and Jesus became the imitator of the Baptist.
Fortunately the latter soon disappeared from the scene, for his influence
on Jesus was in some respects injurious. The Galilaean teacher was on
the verge of losing the sunny religion which He had learned from His
only teacher, the glorious natural scenery which surrounded His home,
and of becoming a gloomy Jewish fanatic. But this influence fell away
from Him again; when He returned to Galilee He became Himself once
more. The only thing which He had gained from John was some knowledge of the art of preaching. He had learned from him how to influence
masses of men. From that time forward He preached with much more
power and gained greater ascendancy over the people.
<P>
With the return to Galilee begins the first act of the piece. The story
of the rise of Christianity is a pastoral play. Bauer, in his "Philo, Strauss,
and Renan," writes with biting sarcasm: "Renan, who is at once
author of the play, the stage-manager, and the director of the theatre,
<P>
<center>185</center>
<P>
gives the signal to begin, and at a sign from him the electric lights are
put on full power, the Bengal fires flare up, the footlights are turned
higher, and while the flutes and shawms of the orchestra strike up the
overture, the people enter and take their places among the bushes and
by the shore of the Lake." And how confiding they were, this gentle
and peaceful company of Galilaean fisher folk! And He, the young
carpenter, conjured the Kingdom of Heaven down to earth for a year,
bv the spell of the infinite tenderness which radiated from Him. A company of men and women, all of the same youthful integrity and simple
innocence, became His followers and constantly repeated "Thou art the
Messiah." By the women He was more beloved than He Himself liked,
but from His passion for the glory of His Father He was content to
attract these "fair creatures" (<i>belles creatures</i>) and suffered them to
serve Him, and God through Him. Three or four devoted Galilaean
women constantly accompanied Him and strove with one another for
the pleasure (<i>le plaisir</i>) of listening to His teaching and attending to
His comfort. Some of them were wealthy and used their means to enable the "amiable" (<i>charmant</i>) prophet to live without needing to
practise His handicraft. The most devoted of all was Mary Magdalene,
whose disordered mind had been healed by the influence of the pure
and gracious beauty (<i>par la beaute pure et douce</i>) of the young Rabbi.
<P>
Thus He rode, on His long-eyelashed gentle mule, from village to
village, from town to town. The sweet theology of love (<i>la delicieuse
theologie de l'amour</i>) won Him all hearts. His preaching was gentle
and mild (<i>suave et douce</i>}, full of nature and the fragrance of the country. Wherever He went the people kept festival. At marriages He was
a welcome guest; to the feasts which He gave He invited women who
were sinners, and publicans like the good Zacchaeus.
<P>
"The Frenchman," remarks Noack, "takes the mummied figure of
the Galilaean Rabbi, which criticism has exhumed, endows it with life
and energy, and brings Him upon the stage, first amid the lustre of
the earthly happiness which it was His pleasure to bestow, and then in
the moving aspect of one doomed to suffer."
<P>
When Jesus goes up to the Passover at the end of this first year, He
comes into conflict with the Rabbis of the capital. The "winsome teacher,
Who offered forgiveness to all on the sole condition of loving Him,"
found in the capital people upon whom His charm had no effect. When
He returned to Galilee He had entirely abandoned His Jewish beliefs,
and a revolutionary ardour glowed in His heart. The second act begins.
"The action becomes more serious and gloomy, and the pupil of Strauss
turns down the footlights of his stage." [1] The erstwhile "winsome moral-
<P>
[1] Bruno Bauer in <i>Philo, Strauss, und Renan</i>.
<P>
<center>186</center>
<P>
ist" has become a transcendental revolutionary. Up to this point He
had thought to bring about the triumph of the Kingdom of God by
natural means, by teaching and influencing men. The Jewish eschatology
stood vaguely in the background. Now it becomes prominent. The tension set up between His purely ethical ideas and these eschatological expectations gives His words from this time forward a special force. The
period of joyous simplicity is past.
<P>
Even the character of the hero loses its simplicity. In the furtherance
of His cause He becomes a wonder-worker. It is true that even before
He had sometimes practised innocent arts such as Joan of Arc made
use of later. [1] He had, for instance, pretended to know the unspoken
thoughts of one whom He desired to win, had reminded him, perhaps
of some experience of which he cherished the memory. He allowed the
people to believe that He received knowledge of certain matters through
a kind of revelation. Finally, it came to be whispered that He had
spoken with Moses and Elias upon the mountains. But He now finds
Himself compelled to adopt in earnest the role which He had formerly
taken, as it were, in play. Against His will He is compelled to found His
work upon miracle. He must face the alternative of either renouncing
His mission or becoming a thaumaturge. He consented, therefore, to
play an active part in many miracles. In this astute friends gave Him
their aid. At Bethany something happened which could be regarded as
a raising of the dead. Perhaps this miracle was arranged by Lazarus
himself. When very ill he had allowed himself to be wrapped in the
cerements of the dead and laid in the grave. His sisters sent for Jesus
and brought Him to the tomb. He desired to look once more upon His
friend, and when, overcome with grief, He cried his name aloud, Lazarus
came forth from the grave. Why should the brother and sisters have
hesitated to provide a miracle for the Master, in whose miracle-working
power they, indeed, believed? Where, then, was Renan's allegiance to
his "honoured master" Strauss, when he thus enrolled himself among
the rationalists?
<P>
On these lines Jesus played His part for eighteen months, from the
Easter of 31 to the Feast of Tabernacles of 32. How great is the change
from the gentle teacher of the Sermon on the Mount! His discourse
takes on a certain hardness of tone. In the synagogue at Capernaum
He drives many from Him, offended by the saying about eating and
drinking His flesh and blood. The "extreme materialism of the expression,"
which in Him had always been the natural counterpoise to the
"extreme idealism of the thought," becomes more and more pronounced.
His "Kingdom of God" was indeed still essentially the kingdom of the
poor, the kingdom of the soul, the great spiritual kingdom; but He now
<P>
[1] Renan does not hesitate to apply this tasteless parallel.
<P>
<center>187</center>
<P>
preached it as the kingdom of the apocalyptic writings. And yet in the
very moment when He seems to be staking everything upon a supernatural
fulfilment of His hopes, He provides with remarkable prescience
the basis of a permanent Church. He appoints the Twelve Apostles and
institutes the fellowship-meal. It is certain, Renan thinks, that the "Supper"
was not first instituted on that last evening; even in the second
Galilaean period He must have practised with His followers the mystic
rite of the Breaking of Bread, which in some way symbolised His
death.
<P>
By the end of this period He had cast off all earthly ambitions. Nothing of earth existed for Him any more. A strange longing for persecution and martyrdom had taken possession of Him. It was not, however,
the resolve to offer an atonement for the sins of His people which
familiarised Him with the thought of death; it was forced upon Him
by the knowledge that He had entered upon a path in which it was impossible for Him to sustain His role for more than a few months, or perhaps even weeks. So He sets out for Jerusalem, outwardly a hero, inwardly half in despair because He has turned aside from His true path.
The gentle, faithful, long-eyelashed mule bears Him, amid the acclamations of the multitude, through the gate of the capital.
<P>
The third act begins: the stage is dark and becomes constantly darker,
until at last, through the darkness of the scene, there is faintly visible
only the figure of a woman-of her who in her deep grief beside the
grave was by her vision to call to life again Him whom she loved. There
was darkness, too, in the souls of the disciples, and in that of the Master.
The bitter jealousy between Judas and John made one of them a traitor.
As for Jesus, He had His hour of gloom to fight through in Gethsemane.
For a moment His human nature awakened in Him; all that He thought
He had slain and put behind Him for ever rose up and confronted Him
as He knelt there upon the ground. "Did He remember the clear brooks
of Galilee at which He might have slaked His thirst-the vine and the
fig-tree beneath which He might have rested-the maidens who would
perhaps have been willing to love Him? Did He regret His too exalted
nature? Did He, a martyr to His own greatness, weep that He had not
remained the simple carpenter of Nazareth? We do not know!"
<P>
He is dead. Renan, as though he stood in Pere Lachaise, commissioned

The bell rings; the curtain begins to fall; the swing-seats tilt. The
epilogue is scarcely heard: "Jesus will never have a rival. His religion
will again and again renew itself; His story will call forth endless tears;

His sufferings will soften the hearts of the best; every successive century will proclaim that among the sons of men there hath not arisen
a greater than Jesus."

The book passed through eight editions in three months. The writings of those who opposed it had an equal vogue. That of Freppel had
reached its twelfth edition in 1864. [1] Their name was legion. Whatever
wore a soutane and could wield a pen charged against Renan, the
bishops leading the van. The tone of these attacks was not always very
elevated, nor their logic very profound. In most cases the writers were
only concerned to defend the Deity of Christ, [2] and the miracles, and
are satisfied that they have done so when they have pointed out some
of the glaring inconsistencies in Renan's work. Here and there, however
among these refutations we catch the tone of a loftier ethical spirit
which has recognised the fundamental weakness of the work, the lack
of any definite ethical principles in the writer's outlook upon life. [3]
There were some indeed who were not content with a refutation; they
would gladly have seen active measures taken against Renan. One of
his most embittered adversaries, Amadee Nicolas, [4] reckons up in an
appendix to his work the maximum penalties authorised by the existing
enactments against free-thought, and would welcome the application of
the law of the 25th of March 1822, according to which five years'
imprisonment could be imposed for the crime of "insulting or making
ridiculous a religion recognised by the state."
<P>
Renan was defended by the <i>Siecle</i>, the <i>Debats</i>, at that time the
leading French newspaper, and the <i>Temps</i>, in which Scherer published five
articles upon the book. Even the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, which had
formerly raised a warning voice against Strauss, allowed itself to go
with the stream, and published in its August number of 1863 a critical
analysis by Havet [5] who hailed Renan's work as a great achievement,

and criticised only the inconsistencies by which he had endeavoured to
soften down the radical character of his undertaking. Later on the <i>Revue</i>
changed its attitude and sided with Renan's opponents. In the Protestant
camp there was an even keener sense of distaste than in the Catholic
for the sentimental gloss which Renan had spread over his work to
make it attractive to the multitude by its iridescent colours. In four
remarkable letters Athanase Coquerel the younger took the author to
task for this. [1] From the standpoint of orthodox scholarship E. de
Pressense condemned him; [2] and proceeded without loss of time to
refute him in a large-scale Life of Jesus. [3] He was answered by Albert
Reville, [4] who claims recognition for Renan's services to criticism.
<P>
In general, however, the rising French school of critical theology was
disappointed in Renan. Their spokesman was Colani. "This is not the
Christ of history, the Christ of the Synoptics," he writes in 1864 in the
<i>Revue de theologie</i>, "but the Christ of the Fourth Gospel, though without
His metaphysical halo, and painted over with a brush which has
been dipped in the melancholy blue of modern poetry, in the rose of
the eighteenth-century idyll, and in the grey of a moral philosophy which
seems to be derived from La Rochefoucauld." "In expressing this
opinion," he adds, "I believe I am speaking in the name of those who belong
to what is known as the new Protestant theology, or the Strassburg
school. We opened M. Renan's book with sympathetic interest; we
closed it with deep disappointment." [5]
<P>
The Strassburg school had good cause to complain of Renan, for he
had trampled their growing crops. They had just begun to arouse
some interest, and slowly and surely to exercise an influence upon the
whole spiritual life of France. Sainte-Beuve had called attention to the
work of Reuss, Colani, Reville, and Scherer. Others of the school were
Michel Nicolas of Montauban and Gustave d'EichthaI. Nefftzer, the
editor of the <i>Temps</i>, who was at the same time a prophet of coming

In general the plan of this work follows Renan's. He divides the Life of Jesus into
three periods: i. The Time of Public Favour; ii. The Period of Conflict; iii. The
Great Week. Death and Victory. By way of introduction there is a long essay on
the supernatural which sets forth the supernaturalistic views of the author.

political events, defended their cause in the Parisian literary world. The
<i>Revue germanique</i> of that period, the influence of which upon French
literature can hardly be over-estimated, was their sworn ally. Then
came Renan and threw public opinion into a ferment of excitement.
Everything in the nature of criticism, and of progress in religious
thought, was associated with his name, and was thereby discredited. By
his untimely and over-easy popularisation of the ideas of the critical
school he ruined their quiet work. The excitement roused by his book
swept away all that had been done by those noble and lofty spirits, who
now found themselves involved in a struggle with the outraged orthodoxy
of Paris, and were hard put to it to defend themselves. Even down
to the present day Renan's work forms the greatest hindrance to any
serious advance in French religious thought.
<P>
The excitement aroused upon the other side of the Rhine was scarcely
less than in Paris. Within a year there appeared five different German
translations, and many of the French criticisms of Renan were also
translated. [1] The German Catholic press was wildly excited; [2] the
Protestant press was more restrained, more inclined to give the author a fair
hearing, and even ventured to express admiration of the historical
merits of his performance. Beyschlag [3] saw in Renan an advance upon
Strauss, inasmuch as for him the life of Jesus as narrated in the Gospels,
while not, indeed, in any sense supernatural, is nevertheless historical.
For a certain school of theology, therefore, Renan was a deliverer from
Strauss; they were especially grateful to him for his defence, sophistical
though it was, of the Fourth Gospel. Weizsacker expressed his admiration.
Strauss, far from directing his "Life of Jesus for the German
People," with which he was then occupied, against the superficial and

frivolous French treatment of the subject-as has sometimes been
alleged - hailed Renan in his preface as a kindred spirit and ally, and
"shook hands with him across the Rhine." Luthardt, [1] however, remained
inexorable. "What is there lacking in Renan's work?" he asks. And he
replies, "It lacks conscience."
<P>
That is a just judgment. From this lack of conscience, Renan has not
been scrupulous where he ought to have been so. There is a kind of
insincerity in the book from beginning to end. Renan professes to
depict the Christ of the Fourth Gospel, though he does not believe in the
authenticity or the miracles of that Gospel. He professes to write a
scientific work, and is always thinking of the great public and how to
interest it. He has thus fused together two works of disparate character.
The historian finds it hard to forgive him for not going more deeply
into the problem of the development in the thought of Jesus, with which
he was brought face to face by the emphasis which he laid on
eschatology, and for offering in place of a solution the highly-coloured
phrases of the novelist.
<P>
Nevertheless, this work will always retain a certain interest, both for
Frenchmen and for Germans. The German is often so completely fascinated
by it as to lose his power of criticism, because he finds in it
German thought in a novel and piquant form. Conversely the Frenchman
discovers in it, behind the familiar form, which is here handled in
such a masterly fashion, ideas belonging to a world which is foreign
to him, ideas which he can never completely assimilate, but which yet

imperishable charm.

And its weakness? That it is written by one to whom the New Testament
was to the last something foreign, who had not read it from his
youth up in the mother-tongue, who was not accustomed to breathe
freely in its simple and pure world, but must perfume it with
sentimentality in order to feel himself at home in it.
