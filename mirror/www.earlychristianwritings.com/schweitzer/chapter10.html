<P>
THE "GOSPEL HISTORY" OF WEISSE WAS WRITTEN, LIKE STRAUSS'S LIFE
of Jesus, by a philosopher who had been driven out of philosophy and
forced back upon theology. Weisse was born in 1801 at Leipzig, and
became Professor Extraordinary of Philosophy in the university there
in 1828. In 1837, finding his advance to the Ordinary Professorship
barred by the Herbartians, he withdrew from academic teaching and
gave himself to the preparation of this work, the plan of which he had
had in mind for some time. Having brought it to a satisfactory 
completion, he began again in 1841 as a Privat-Docent in Philosophy, and
became Ordinary Professor in 1845. From 1848 onwards he lectured on
Theology also. His work on "Philosophical Dogmatics, or the Philosophy
of Christianity," [1] is well known. He died in 1866, of cholera. Lotze
and Lipsius were both much influenced by him.
<P>
Weisse admired Strauss and hailed his Life of Jesus as a forward step
towards the reconciliation of religion and philosophy. He expresses his
gratitude to him for clearing the ground of the primeval forest of theology, thus rendering it possible for him (Weisse) to develop his views
without wasting time upon polemics, "since most of the views which
have hitherto prevailed may be regarded as having received the <i>coup
de grace</i> from Strauss." He is at one with Strauss also in his general
view of the relations of philosophy and religion, holding that it is only
it philosophy, by following its own path, attains independently to the
<P>
[1] <i>Philosophische Dogmatik oder Philosophic des Christentums</i>. Leipzig, 1855-1862.
<P>
<center>122</center>
<P>
conviction of the truth of Christianity that its alliance with theology and
religion can be welcomed as advantageous. [1] His work, therefore, like
that of Strauss, leads up finally to a philosophical exposition in which
he shows how for us the Jesus of history becomes the Christ of
faith. [2]
<P>
Weisse is the direct continuator of Strauss. Standing outside the
limitations of the Hegelian formulae, he begins at the point where
Strauss leaves off. His aim is to discover, if possible, some thread of
general connexion in the narratives of the Gospel tradition, which, if
present, would represent a historically certain element in the Life of
Jesus, and thus serve as a better standard by which to determine the
extent of myth than can possibly be found in the subjective impression
upon which Strauss relies. Strauss, by way of gratitude, called him a
dilettante. This was most unjust, for if any one deserved to share
Strauss's place of honour, it was certainly Weisse.
<P>
The idea that Mark's Gospel might be the earliest of the four, first
occurred to Weisse during the progress of his work. In March 1837,
when he reviewed Tholuck's "Credibility of the Gospel History," he
was as innocent of this discovery as Wilke was at the same period. But
when once he had observed that the graphic details of Mark, which had
hitherto been regarded as due to an attempt to embellish an epitomising
narrative, were too insignificant to have been inserted with this
purpose, it became clear to him that only one other possibility remained
open, viz., that their absence in Matthew and Luke was due to omission.
He illustrates this from the description of the first day of Jesus' ministry
at Capernaum. "The relation of the first Evangelist to Mark," he avers,
"in those portions of the Gospel which are common to both is, with few
exceptions, mainly that of an epitomiser."
<P>
The decisive argument for the priority of Mark is, even more than his
graphic detail, the composition and arrangement of the whole. "It is
true, the Gospel of Mark shows very distinct traces of having arisen out
of spoken discourses, which themselves were by no means ordered and
connected, but disconnected and fragmentary"—being, he means, in its
original form based on notes of the incidents related by Peter. "It is
not the work of an eyewitness, nor even of one who had had an opportunity of questioning eyewitnesses thoroughly and carefully; nor

[1] At the end of his preface he makes the striking remark: "I confess I cannot
conceive of any possible way by which Christianity can take on a form which will
make it once more the truth for our time, without having recourse to the aid of
philosophy; and I rejoice to believe that this opinion is shared by many of the
ablest and most respected of present-day theologians."

Bedeutung der Personlichkeit Christi und der evangelischen Uberlieferung</i>. (Con-
cluding Philosophical Estimate of the Significance of the Person of Christ and of

<center>123</center>
<P>
even of deriving assistance from inquirers who, on their part, had made
a connected study of the subject, with a view to filling up the gaps and
placing each individual part in its right position, and so articulating the
whole into an organic unity which should be neither merely inward, nor
on the other hand merely external." Nevertheless the Evangelist was
guided in his work by a just recollection of the general course of the
life of Jesus. "It is precisely in Mark," Weisse explains, "that a closer
study unmistabably reveals that the incidental remarks (referring for
the most part to the way in which the fame of Jesus gradually extended,
the way the people began to gather round Him and the sick to besiege
Him), far from shutting off and separating the different narratives,
tend rather to unite them with each other, and so give the impression
not of a series of anecdotes fortuitously thrown together, but of a con-
nected history. By means of these remarks, and by many other connecting links which he works into the narration of the individual stories,
Mark has succeeded in conveying a vivid impression of the stir which
Jesus made in Galileo, and from Galilee to Jerusalem, of the gradual
gathering of the multitudes to Him, of the growing intensity of loyalty
in the inner circle of disciples, and as the counterpart of all this, of the
growing enmity of the Pharisees and Scribes—an impression which
mere isolated narratives, strung together without any living connexion,
would not have sufficed to produce." A connexion of this kind is less
clearly present in the other Synoptists, and is wholly lacking in John.
The Fourth Gospel, by itself, would give us a completely false con-
ception of the relation of Jesus to the people. From the content of its
narratives the reader would form the impression that the attitude of the
people towards Jesus was hostile fiom the very first, and that it was
only in isolated occasions, for a brief moment, that Jesus by His miraculous acts inspired the people with astonishment rather than admiration; that, surrounded by a little company of disciples he contrived for
a time to defy the enmity of the multitude, and that, having repeatedly
provoked it by intemperate invective, he finally succumbed to it.
<P>
The simplicity of the plan of Mark is, in Weisse's opinion, a stronger
argument for his priority than the most elaborate demonstration; one
only needs to compare it with the perverse design of Luke, who makes
Jesus undertake a journey through Samaria. "How," asks Weisse, "in
the case of a writer who does things of this kind can it be possible at this
time of day to speak seriously of historical exactitude in the use of his
sources?"
<P>
To come down to detail, Weisse's argument for the priority of Mark
rests mainly on the following propositions:—
<P>
1. In the first and third Gospels, traces of a common plan are found
only in those parts which they have in common with Mark, not
in those which are common to them, but not to Mark also.
<P>
<center>124</center>
<P>
2. In those parts which the three Gospels have in common, the "agreement" of the other two is mediated through Mark.
<P>
3. In those sections which the First and Third Gospels have, but Mark
has not, the agreement consists in the language and incidents, not
in the order. Their common source, therefore, the "Logia" of
Matthew, did not contain any type of tradition which gave an
order of narration different from that of Mark.
<P>
4. The divergences of wording between the two other Synoptists is in
general greater in the parts where both have drawn on the Logia
document than where Mark is their source.
<P>
5. The first Evangelist reproduces this Logia-document more faithfully than Luke does; but his Gospel seems to have been of later origin.
<P>
This historical argument for the priority of Mark was confirmed in
the year in which it appeared by Wilke's work, "The Earliest Gospel," [1]
<P>
[1] Christian Gottlob Wilke, formerly pastor of Hermannsdorf in the Erzgebirge.
<i>Der Urevangelist, oder eine exegetisch-kritische Untersuchung des Verwandschafts-verhaltnisses der drei ersten Evangelien</i>. (The Earliest Evangelist, a Critical and
Exegetical Inquiry into the Relationship of the First Three Gospels.) The subse-
quent course of the discussion of the Marcan hypothesis was as follows:—
<P>
In answer to Wilke there appeared a work signed Philosophotos Aletheias, <i>Die
Evangelien, ihr Geist, ihre Verfasser, und ihr Verhaltnis zu einander</i>. (The Gospels,
their Spirit, their Authors, and their relation to one another.) Leipzig, 1845, 440
pp. The author sees in Paul the evil genius of early Christianity, and thinks that
the work of scientific criticism must be directed to detecting and weeding out the
Pauline elements in the Gospels. Luke is in his opinion a party-writing, biased by
Paulinism; in fact Paul had a share in its preparation, and this is what Paul alludes
to when he speaks in Romans ii. 16, xi. 28, and xvi. 25 of "his" Gospel. His hand
is especially recognisable in chapters i.-iii., vii., ix., xi., xviii., xx., xxi., and xxiv.
Mark consists of extracts from Matthew and Luke; John presupposes the other
three. The Tiibingen standpoint was set forth by Baur in his work, <i>Kritische
Untersuchangen liber die kanonischen Evangelien</i>. (A Critical Examination of the Ca-
nonical Gospels.) Tubingen, 1847, 622 pp. According to him Mark is based on
Matthew and Luke. At the same time, however, the irreconcilability of the Fourth
Gospel with the Synoptists is for the first time fully worked out, and the refutation
of its historical character is carried into detail.
<P>
The order Matthew, Mark, Luke is defended by Adolf Hilgenfeld in his work
<i>Die Evangelien</i>. Leipzig, 1854, 355 pp.
<P>
Karl Reinhold Kostlin's work, <i>Der Ursprung und die Komposition der
synoptischen Evangelien</i> (Origin and Composition of the Synoptic Gospels), is rendered
nugatory by obscurities and compromises. Stuttgart, 1853, 400 pp. The priority
of Mark is defended by Edward Reuss, <i>Die Geschichte der keiligen Schriften des
Neuen Testaments</i> (History of the Sacred Writings of the New Testament), 1842;
H. Ewald, <i>Die drei visten Evangelien</i>, 1850; A. Ritschi <i>Die Entstehung der
altcatholischen Kirche</i> (Origin of the ancient Catholic Church), 1850; A. Reville,
<i>Etudes critiques sur l'Evangile selon St Matthieu</i>, 1862. In 1863 the foundations of
the Marcan hypothesis were relaid, more firmly than before, by Holtzmann's work,
<i>Die synoptischen Evangelien</i>. Leipzig, 1863, 514 pp.
<P>
<center>125</center>
<P>
which treated the problem more from the literary side, and, to take an
illustration from astronomy, supplied the mathematical confirmation of
the hypothesis.
<P>
In regard to the Gospel of John, Weisse fully shared the negative
views of Strauss. What is the use, he asks, of keeping on talking about
the plan of this Gospel, seeing that no one has yet succeeded in showing
what that plan is? And for a very good reason: there is none. One would
never guess from the Gospel of John that Jesus, until His departure
from Galilee, had experienced almost unbroken success. It is no good
trying to explain the want of plan by saying that John wrote with the
purpose of supplementing and correcting his predecessors, and that his
omissions and additions were determined by this purpose. Such a
purpose is betrayed by no single word in the whole Gospel.
<P>
The want of plan lies in the very plan itself. "It is a fixed idea, one
may say, with the author of this Gospel, who had heard that Jesus had
fallen a victim in Jerusalem to the hatred of the Jewish rulers, especially
the Scribes, that he must represent Jesus as engaged, from His first
appearance onward, in an unceasing struggle with 'the Jews'—whereas we
know that the mass of the people, even to the last, in Jerusalem itself,
were on the side of Jesus; so much so, indeed, that His enemies were
only able to get Him into their power by means of a secret betrayal."
<P>
In regard to the graphic descriptions in John, of which so much has
been made, the case is no better. It is the graphic detail of a writer who
desires to work up a vivid picture, not the natural touches of an
eyewitness, and there are, moreover, actual inconsistencies, as in the case
of the healing at the pool of Bethesda. The circumstantiality is due to the
care of the author not to assume an acquaintance, on the part of his
readers, with Jewish usages or the topography of Palestine. "A
considerable proportion of the details are of such a character as inevitably to
suggest that the narrator inserts them because of the trouble which it
has cost him to orientate himself in regard to the scene of the action
and the dramatis personae, his object being to spare his readers a
similar difficulty; though he does not always go about it in the way best
calculated to effect his purpose."
<P>
The impossibility also that the historic Jesus can have preached the
doctrine of the Johannine Christ, is as clear to Weisse as to Strauss.
"It is not so much a picture of Christ that John sets forth, as a
conception of Christ; his Christ does not speak in His own Person, but of
His own Person."
<P>
On the other hand, however, "the authority of the whole Christian
Church from the second century to the nineteenth" carries too much
weight with Weisse for him to venture altogether to deny the Johannine
origin of the Gospel; and he seeks a middle path. He assumes that the
didactic portions really, for the most part, go back to John the Apostle.
<P>
<center>126</center>
<P>
"John," he explains, "drawn on by the interest of a system of doctrine
which had formed itself in his mind, not so much as a direct reflex of
the teaching of his Master, as on the basis of suggestions offered by that
teaching in combination with a certain creative activity of his own,
endeavoured to find this system also in the teaching of his Master."
<P>
Accordingly, with this purpose, and originally for himself alone, not
with the object of communicating it to others, he made an effort to
exhibit, in the light of this system of thought, what his memory still retained of the discourses of the Lord. "The Johannine discourses, therefore, were recalled by a laborious effort of memory on the part of the
disciple. When he found that his memory-image of his Master was
threatening to dissolve into a mist-wraith, he endeavoured to impress the
picture more firmly in his recollection, to connect and define its rapidly
disappearing features, reconstructing it by the aid of a theory evolved
by himself or drawn from elsewhere regarding the Person and work
of the Master." For the portrait of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels the
mind of the disciples who describe Him is a neutral medium; for the
portrait in John it is a factor which contributes to the production of the
picture. The same portrait is outlined by the apostle in the first epistle
which bears his name.
<P>
These tentative "essays," not originally intended for publication,
came, after the death of the apostle, into the hands of his adherents and
disciples, and they chose the form of a complete Life of Jesus as that
in which to give them to the world. They, therefore, added narrative
portions, which they distributed here and there among the speeches,
often doing some violence to the latter in the process. Such was the
origin of the Fourth Gospel.
<P>
Weisse is not blind to the fact that this hypothesis of a Johannine
basis in the Gospel is beset with the gravest—one might almost say with
insuperable—difficulties. Here is a man who was an immediate disciple
of the Lord, one who, in the Synoptic Gospels, in Acts, and in the Pauline
letters, appears in a character which gives no hint of a coming spiritual
metamorphosis, one, moreover, who at a relatively late period, when
it might well have been supposed that his development was in all essentials closed (at the time of Paul's visit to Jerusalem, which falls at least
fourteen years after Paul's conversion), was chosen, along with James
and Peter, and in contrast with the apostles of the Gentiles, Paul and
Barnabas, as an apostle of the Jews—"how is it possible," asks Weisse,
"to explain and make it intelligible, that a man of these antecedents displays in his thought and speech, in fact in his whole mental attitude, a
thoroughly Hellenistic stamp? How came he, the beloved disciple, who,
according to this very Gospel which bears his name, was admitted more
intimately than any other into the confidence of Jesus, how came he to
<P>
<center>127</center>
<P>
clothe his Master in this foreign garb of Hellenistic speculation, and to
attribute to Him this alien manner of speech? But, however difficult the
explanation may be, whatever extreme of improbability may seem to us
to be involved in the assumption of the Johannine authorship of the
Epistle and of these essential elements of the Gospel, it is better to assent
to the improbability, to submit to the burden of being forced to explain
the inexplicable, than to set ourselves obstinately against the weight of
testimony, against the authority of the whole Christian Church from the
second century to the present day."
<P>
There could be no better argument against the genuineness of the
Fourth Gospel than just such a defence of its genuineness as this. In
this form the hypothesis may well be destined to lead a harmless and
never-ending life. What matters for the historical study of the Life of
Jesus is simply that the Fourth Gospel should be ruled out. And that
Weisse does so thoroughly that it is impossible to imagine its being
done more thoroughly. The speeches, in spite of their apostolic authority, are unhistorical, and need not be taken into account in describing
Jesus' system of thought. As for the unhappy redactor, who by adding
the narrative pictures created the Gospel, all possibility of his reports
being accurate is roundly denied, and as if that was not enough, he must
put up with being called a bungler into the bargain. "I have, to tell the
truth, no very high opinion of the literary art of the editor of the Johannine Gospel-document," says Weisse in his "Problem of the Gospels"
of 1856, which is the best commentary upon his earlier work.
<P>
His treatment of the Fourth Gospel reminds us of the story that
Frederic the Great once appointed an importunate office-seeker to the
post of "Privy Councillor for War," on condition that he would never
presume to offer a syllable of advice!
<P>
The hypothesis which was brought forward about the same time by
Alexander Schweizer, [1] with the intention of saving the genuineness of
the Gospel of John, did not make any real contribution to the subject.
The reading of the facts which form his starting-point is almost the
exact converse of that of Weisse, since he regards, not the speeches, but
certain parts of the narrative as Johannine. That which it is possible, in
his opinion, to refer to the apostle is an account, not involving any
<P>
[1] Alexander Schweizer, <i>Das Evangelium Johannis nach seinem inneren Werte
md seiner Bedeutung fiir das Leben Jesu kritisch untersucht</i>. 1841. (A Critical
Examination of the Intrinsic Value of the Gospel of John and of its Importance as a
Source for the Life of Jesus.) Alexander Schweizer was born in 1808 at Murten,
was appointed Professor of Pastoral Theology at Zurich in 1835, and continued to
lecture there until his death in 1888, remaining loyal to the ideas of his teacher
Schleiennacher, though handling them with a certain freedom. His best-known
work is his <i>Glaabenslehre</i> (System of Doctrine), 2 vols., 1863-1872; 2nd ed,, 1877.

<P>
miracles, of the ministry of Jesus at Jerusalem, and the discourses
which He delivered there. The more or less miraculous events which
occur in the course of it—such as, that Jesus had seen Nathanael under
the fig-tree, knew the past life of the Samaritan woman, and healed the
sick man at the Pool of Bethesda—are of a simple character, and contrast markedly with those which are represented to have occurred in
Galilee, where Jesus turned water into wine and fed a multitude with
a few crusts of bread. We must, therefore, suppose that this short, authentic, spiritual Jerusalem-Gospel has had a Galilaean Life of Jesus
worked into it, and this explains the inconsistencies of the representation
and the oscillation between a sensuous and a spiritual point of view.
<P>
This distinction, however, cannot be made good. Schweizer was
obliged to ascribe the reports of a material resurrection to the Galilaean
source, whereas these, since they exclude the Galilaean appearances of
Jesus, must belong to the Jerusalem Gospel; and accordingly, the whole
distinction between a spiritual and material Gospel falls to the ground.
Thus this hypothesis at best preserves the nominal authenticity of the
Fourth Gospel, only to deprive it immediately of all value as a historical
source.
<P>
Had Strauss calmly examined the bearing of Weisse's hypothesis, he
would have seen that it fully confirmed the line he had taken in leaving
the Fourth Gospel out of account, and he might have been less unjust
towards the hypothesis of the priority of Mark, for which he cherished
a blind hatred, because, in its fully developed form, it first met him in
conjunction with seemingly reactionary tendencies towards the rehabilitation of John. He never in the whole course of his life got rid of the
prejudice that the recognition of the priority of Mark was identical
With a retrograde movement towards an uncritical orthodoxy.
<P>
This is certainly not true as regards Weisse. He is far from having
used Mark unreservedly as a historical source. On the contrary, he says
expressly that the picture which this Gospel gives of Jesus is drawn by
an imaginative disciple of the faith, filled with the glory of his subject,
whose enthusiasm is consequently sometimes stronger than his judgment. Even in Mark the mythopoeic tendency is already actively at work, so that often the task of historical criticism is to explain how
such myths could have been accepted by a reporter who stands as near
the facts as Mark does.
<P>
Of the <i>miracula</i> [1]—so Weisse denominates the "non-genuine" miracles,
in contradistinction to the "genuine"—the feeding of the multitude is
<P>
[1] The German is <i>Mirakein</i>, the usual word being <i>Wunder</i>, which, though constantly used in the sense of actual "miracles," has, from its obvious derivation, a certain ambiguity.
<P>
<center>129</center>
<P>
that which, above all others, cries aloud for an explanation. Its historical strength lies in its being firmly interwoven with the preceding and
following context; and this applies to both the Marcan narratives. It is
therefore impossible to regard the story, as Strauss proposes to do, as
pure myth; it is necessary to show how, growing out of some incident
belonging to that context, it assumed its present literary form. The
authentic saying about the leaven of the Pharisees, which, in Mark viii.
14 and 15, is connected with the two miracles of feeding the multitude,
gives ground for supposing that they rest upon a parabolic discourse
repeated on two occasions, in which Jesus spoke, perhaps with allusion
to the manna, of a miraculous food given through Him. These discourses were later transformed by tradition into an actual miraculous
giving of food. Here, therefore, Weisse endeavours to substitute for
Strauss's "unhistorical" conception of myth a different conception, which
in each case seeks to discover a sufficient historical cause.
<P>
The miracles at the baptism of Jesus are based upon His account
of a vision which He experienced in that moment. The present form of
the story of the transfiguration has a twofold origin. In the first place,
it is partly based on a real experience shared by the three disciples.
That there is an historical fact here is evident from the way in which
it is connected with the context by a definite indication of time. The
six days of Mark ix. 2 cannot really be connected, as Strauss would have
us suppose, with Ex. xxiv. 16; [1] the meaning is simply that between the
previously reported discourse of Jesus and the event described there
was an interval of six days. The three disciples had a waking, spiritual
vision, not a dream-vision, and what was revealed in this vision was the
Messiahship of Jesus. But at this point comes in the second, the mythico-symbolical element. The disciples see Jesus accompanied, according to
the Jewish Messianic expectations, by those whom the people thought
of as His forerunners. He, however, turns away from them, and Moses
and Elias, for whom the disciples were about to build tabernacles, for
them to abide in, disappear. The mythical element is a reflection of the
teaching which Jesus imparted to them on that occasion, in consequence
of which there dawned on them the spiritual "significance of those expectations and predictions, which they were to recognise as no longer
pointing forward to a future fulfilment, but as already fulfilled." The
high mountain upon which, according to Mark, the event took place is
not to be understood in a literal sense, but as symbolical of the sublimity of the revelation; it is to be sought not on the map of Palestine,
but in the recesses of the spirit.
<P>
The most striking case of the formation of myth is the story of the
<P>
[1] "And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it
six days."
<P>
<center>130</center>
<P>
resurrection. Here, too, myth must have attached itself to an historical
fact. The fact in question is not, however, the empty grave. This only
came into the story later, when the Jews, in order to counteract the
Christian belief in the resurrection, had spread abroad the report that
the body had been stolen from the grave. In consequence of this report
the empty grave had necessarily to be taken up into the story, the Christian account now making use of the fact that the body of Jesus was not
found as a proof of His bodily resurrection. The emphasis laid on the
identity of the body which was buried with that which rose again, of
which the Fourth Evangelist makes so much, belongs to a time when
the Church had to oppose the Gnostic conception of a spiritual, incorporeal immortality. The reaction against Gnosticism is, as Weisse
rightly remarks, one of the most potent factors in the development of
myth in the Gospel history. As an additional instance of this he might
have cited the anti-gnostic form of the Johannine account of the baptism of Jesus.
<P>
What, then, is the historical fact in the resurrection? "The historical
fact," replies Weisse, "is only the existence of a belief—not the belief
of the later Christian Church in the myth of the bodily resurrection of
the Lord—but the personal belief of the Apostles and their companions
in the miraculous presence of the risen Christ in the visions and appearances which they experienced." "The question whether those extraordinary phenomena which, soon after the death of the Lord, actually
and undeniably took place within the community of His disciples, rest
upon fact or illusion—that is, whether in them the departed spirit of
the Lord, of whose presence the disciples supposed themselves to be
conscious, was really present, or whether the pheonomena were produced by natural causes of a different kind, spiritual and psychical, is
a question which cannot be answered without going beyond the confines
of purely historical criticism." The only thing which is certain is "that
the resurrection of Jesus is a fact which belongs to the domain of the
spiritual and psychic life, and which is not related to outward corporeal
existence in such a way that the body which was laid in the grave
could have shared therein." When the disciples of Jesus had their first
vision of the glorified body of their Lord, they were far from Jerusalem,
far from the grave, and had no thought of bringing that spiritual corporeity into any kind of relation with the dead body of the Crucified.
That the earliest appearances took place in Galilee is indicated by the
genuine conclusion of Mark, according to which the angel charges the
women with the message that the disciples were to await Jesus in Galilee.
<P>
Strauss's conception of myth, which failed to give it any point of vital
connexion with the history, had not provided any escape from the
dilemma offered by the rationalistic and supernaturalistic views of the
<P>
<center>131</center>
<P>
resurrection. Weisse prepared a new historical basis for a solution.
He was the first to handle the problem from a point of view which combined historical with psychological considerations, and he is fully conscious of the novelty and the far-reaching consequences of his attempt.
Theological science did not overtake him for sixty years; and though
it did not for the most part share his one-sidedness in recognising only
the Galilaean appearances, that does not count for much, since it was
unable to solve the problem of the double tradition regarding the appearances. His discussion of the question is, both from the religious
and from the historical point of view, the most satisfying treatment of it
with which we are acquainted; the pompous and circumspect utterances
of the very latest theology in regard to the "empty grave" look very
poor in comparison. Weisse's psychology requires only one correction—the insertion into it of the eschatological premise.
<P>
It is not only the admixture of myth, but the whole character of the
Marcan representation, which forbids us to use it without reserve as a
source for the life of Jesus. The inventor of the Marcan hypothesis
never wearies of repeating that even in the Second Gospel it is only the
main outline of the Life of Jesus, not the way in which the various
sections are joined together, which is historical. He does not, therefore,
venture to write a Life of Jesus, but begins with a "General Sketch of
the Gospel History" in which he gives the main outlines of the Life of
Jesus according to Mark, and then proceeds to explain the incidents and
discourses in each several Gospel in the order in which they occur.
<P>
He avoids the professedly historical forced interpretation of detail,
which later representatives of the Marcan hypothesis, Schenkel in par-
ticular, employ in such distressing fashion that Wrede's book, by mak-
ing an end of this inquisitorial method of extracting the Evangelist's
testimony, may be said to have released the Marcan hypothesis from
the torture-chamber. Weisse is free from these over-refinements. He
refuses to divide the Galilaean ministry of Jesus into a period of success and a period of failure and gradual falling off of adherents, divided
by the controversy about legal purity in Mark vii.; he does not allow
<P>
<center>132</center>
<P>
this episode to counterbalance the general evidence that Jesus' public
work was accompanied by a constantly growing success. Nor does it
occur to him to conceive the sojourn of the Lord in Phoenician territory,
and His journey to the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, as a compulsory withdrawal from Galilee, an abandonment of His cause in that
district, and to head the chapter, as was usual in the second period of
the exegesis of Mark, "Flights and Retirements." He is content simply
to state that Jesus once visited those regions, and explicitly remarks that
while the Synoptists speak of the Pharisees and Scribes as working
actively against Him, there is nowhere any hint of a hostile movement
on the part of the people, but that, on the contrary, in spite of the Scribes
and Pharisees the people are always ready to approve Him and take His
part; so much so that His enemies can only hope to get Him into their
power by a secret betrayal.
<P>
Weisse does not admit any failure in Jesus' work, nor that death came
upon Him from without as an inevitable necessity. He cannot, therefore, regard the thought of suffering as forced upon Jesus by outward
events. Later interpreters of Mark have often held that the essential
thing in the Lord's resolve to die was that by His voluntary acceptance
of a fate which was more and more clearly revealing itself as inevitable,
He raised it into the sphere of ethico-religious freedom: this was not
Weisse's view. Jesus, according to him, was not moved by any outward
circumstances when He set out for Jerusalem in order to die there. He
did it in obedience to a supra-rational higher necessity. We can at most
venture to conjecture that a cessation of His miracle-working power, of
which He had become aware, revealed to Him that the hour appointed
by God had come. He did, in fact, no further miracle in Jerusalem.
<P>
How far Isaiah liii. may have contributed to suggest the conception
of such a death being a necessary part of Messiah's work, it is impossible to discover. In the popular expectation there was no thought of the
Messiah as suffering. The thought was conceived by Jesus independently, through His deep and penetrating spiritual insight. Without any
external suggestion whatever He announces to His disciples that He is
to die at Jerusalem, and that He is going thither with that end in view.
He journeyed, not to the Passover, but to His death. The fact that it
took place at the time of the Feast was, so far as Jesus was concerned,
accidental. The circumstances of His entry were such as to suggest anything rather than the fulfilment of His predictions; but though the
jubilant multitude surrounded Him day by day, as with a wall of defence, He did not let that make Him falter in His purpose; rather he
forced the authorities to arrest Him; He preserved silence before Pilate
with the deliberate purpose of rendering His death inevitable. The
theory of later defenders of the Marcan hypothesis that Jesus, giving up
<P>
<center>133</center>
<P>
His cause in Galilee for lost, went up to Jerusalem to conquer or die,
is foreign to Weisse's conception. In his view, Jesus, breaking off His
Galilaean work while the tide of success was still flowing strongly,
journeyed to Jerusalem, in the scorn of consequence, with the sole pur-
pose of dying there.
<P>
It is true there are some premonitions of the later course of Marcan
exegesis. The Second Gospel mentions no Passover journeys as falling
in the course of the public ministry of Jesus; consequently the most
natural conclusion would be that no Passover journeys fall within that
period; that is, that Jesus' ministry began after one Passover and closed
with the next, thus lasting less than a full year. Weisse thinks, however,
that it is impossible to understand the success of His teaching unless we
assume a ministry of several years, of more than three years, indeed.
Mark does not mention the Feasts simply because Jesus did not go up
to Jerusalem. "Intrinsic probability is, in our opinion, so strongly in
favour of a duration of a considerable number of years, that we are at
a loss to explain how it is that at least a few unprejudiced investigators
have not found in this a sufficient reason for departing from the traditional opinion."
<P>
The account of the mission of the Twelve is also, on the ground of
"intrinsic probability," explained in a way which is not in accordance
with the plain sense of the words. "We do not think," says Weisse, "that
it is necessary to understand this in the sense that He sent all the twelve
out at one time, two and two, remaining alone in the meantime; it is
much more natural to suppose that He only sent them out two at a time,
keeping the others about Him. The object of this mission was less the
immediate spreading abroad of His teaching than the preparation of the
disciples themselves for the independent activity which they would have
to exercise after His death." These are, however, the only serious liberties
which he takes with the statements of Mark.
<P>
When did Jesus begin to think of Himself as the Messiah? The baptism seems to have marked an epoch in regard to His Messianic consciousness, but that does not mean that He had not previously begun to
have such thoughts about Himself. In any case He did not on that occasion arrive all at once at that point of His inward journey which He
had reached at the time of His first public appearance. We must assume
a period of some duration between the baptism and the beginning of
His ministry—a longer period than we should suppose from the Synoptists—during which Jesus cast off the Messianic ideas of Judaism
and attained to a spiritual conception of the Messiahship. When He
began to teach, His "development" was already closed. Later interpreters
of Mark have generally differed from Weisse in assuming a development
in the thought of Jesus during His public ministry.
<P>
<center>134</center>
<P>
His conception of the Messiahship was therefore fully formed when
He began to teach in Capernaum; but He did not allow the people to
see that He held Himself to be the Messiah until His triumphal entry.
It was in order to avoid declaring His Messiahship that He kept away
from Jerusalem. "It was only in Galilee and not in the Jewish capital
that an extended period of teaching and work was possible for Him
without being obliged to make an explicit declaration whether He were
the Messiah or no. In Jerusalem itself the High Priests and Scribes
would soon have put this question to Him in such a way that He could
not have avoided answering it, whereas in Galilee He doubtless on more
than one occasion cut short such attempts to question Him too closely
by the incisiveness of His replies." Like Strauss, Weisse recognises that
the key to the explanation of the Messianic consciousness of Jesus lies
in the self-designation "Son of Man." "We are most certainly justified,"
he says, with almost prophetic insight, in his "Problem of the Gospels,"
published in 1856, "in regarding the question, what sense the Divine
Saviour desired to attach to this predicate?—what, in fact, He intended
to make known about Himself by using the title Son of Man?—as an
essential question for the right understanding of His teaching, and not
of His teaching only, but also of the very heart and inmost essence of
His personality."
<P>
But at this point Weisse lets in the cloven hoof of that fatal method
of interpretation, by the aid of which the defenders of the Marcan
hypothesis who succeeded him were to wage war, with a kind of dull
and dogged determination, against eschatology, in the interests of an
original and "spiritual" conception of the Messiahship supposed to be
held by Jesus. Under the obsession of the fixed idea that it was their
mission to defend the "originality" of Jesus by ascribing to Him a
modernising transformation and spiritualisation of the eschatological
system of ideas, the defenders of the Marcan hypothesis have impeded
the historical study of the Life of Jesus to an almost unbelievable extent.
<P>
The explanation of the name Son of Man had, Weisse explains,
hitherto oscillated between two extremes. Some had held the expression
to be, even in the mouth of Jesus, equivalent to "man" in general, an
interpretation which cannot be carried through; others had connected
it with the Son of Man in Daniel, and supposed that in using the term
Jesus was employing a Messianic title understood by and current among
the Jews. But how came He to employ only this unusual periphrastic
name for the Messiah? Further, if this name were really a Messianic
title, how could He repeatedly have refused Messianic salutations, and
not until the triumphal entry suffered the people to hail Him as Messiah?
<P>
<center>135</center>
<P>
The questions are rightly asked; it is therefore the more pity that
they are wrongly answered. It follows, Weisse says, from the above
considerations that Jesus did not assume an acquaintance on the part
of His hearers with the Old Testament Messianic significance of the
expression. "It was therefore incontestably the intention of Jesus—and
any one who considers it unworthy betrays thereby his own want of
insight—that the designation should have something mysterious about
it, something which would compel His hearers to reflect upon His meaning." The expression Son of Man was calculated to lead them on to
higher conceptions of His nature and origin, and therefore sums up in
itself the whole spiritualisation of the Messiahship.
<P>
Weisse, therefore, passionately rejects any suggestion, however modest, that Jesus' self-designation, Son of Man, implies any measure of
acceptance of the Jewish apocalyptic system of ideas. Ewald had furnished forth his Life of Jesus [1] with a wealth of Old Testament learning,
and had made some half-hearted attempts to show the connexion of
Jesus' system of thought with that of post-canonical Judaism, but without taking the matter seriously and without having any suspicion of the
real character of the eschatology of Jesus. But even these parade-ground
tactics excite Weisse's indignation; in his book, published in 1856, he
reproaches Ewald with failing to understand his task.
<P>
The real duty of criticism is, according to Weisse, to show that Jesus
had no part in those fantastic errors which are falsely attributed to
Him when a literal Jewish interpretation is given to His great sayings
about the future of the Son of Man, and to remove all the obstacles
which seem to have prevented hitherto the recognition of the novel
character and special significance of the expression. Son of Man, in
the mouth of Him who, of His own free choice, applied this name to
Himself. "How long will it be," he cries, "before theology at last becomes aware of the deep importance of its task? Historical criticism,
exercised with all the thoroughness and impartiality which alone can
produce a genuine conviction, must free the Master's own teaching from
the imputation that lies upon it—the imputation of sharing the errors
and false expectations in which, as we cannot deny, owing to imperfect
or mistaken understanding of the suggestions of the Master, the Apostles,
and with them the whole early Christian Church, became involved."
<P>
This fundamental position determines the remainder of Weisse's
views. Jesus cannot have shared the Jewish particularism. He did not
hold the Law to be binding. It was for this reason that He did not go
up to the Feasts. He distinctly and repeatedly expressed the conviction
that His doctrine was destined for the whole world. In speaking of the
<P>
[l] <i>Geschichte Christus' und seiner Zeit</i>. (History of Christ and His Times.) By
Heinrich Ewald, Gottingen, 1855, 450 pp.
<P>
<center>136</center>
<P>
parousia of the Son of Man He was using a figure—a figure which includes in a mysterious fashion all His predictions of the future. He did
not speak to His disciples of His resurrection, His ascension, and His
parousia as three distinct acts, since the event to which He looked forward is not identical with any of the three, but is composed of them
all. The resurrection is, at the same time, the ascension and parousia,
and in the parousia the resurrection and the ascension are also included.
"The one conclusion to which we believe we can point with certainty is
that Jesus spoke of the future of His work and His teaching in a way
that implied the consciousness of an influence to be continued after His
death, whether unbrokenly or intermittently, and the consciousness that
by this influence His work and teaching would be preserved from destruction and the final victory assured to it."
<P>
The personal presence of Jesus which the disciples experienced after
His death was in their view only a partial fulfilment of that general
promise. The parousia appeared to them as still awaiting fulfilment,
Thought of thus, as an isolated event, they could only conceive it from
the Jewish apocalyptic standpoint, and they finally came to suppose that
they had derived these fantastic ideas from the Master Himself.
<P>
In his determined opposition to the recognition of eschatology in
Strauss's first Life of Jesus, Weisse here lays down the lines which were
to be followed by the "liberal" Lives of Jesus of the 'sixties and following years, which only differ from him, not always to their advantage,
in their more elaborate interpretation of the detail of Mark. The only
work, therefore, which was a conscious continuation of Strauss's, takes,
in spite of its just appreciation of the character of the sources, a wrong
path, led astray by the mistaken idea of the "originality" of Jesus, which
it exalts into a canon of historical criticism. Only after long and devious
wanderings did the study of the subject find the right road again. The
whole struggle over eschatology is nothing else than a gradual elimination of Wiesse's ideas. It was only with Johannes Weiss that theology
escaped from the influence of Christian Hermann Weisse.
