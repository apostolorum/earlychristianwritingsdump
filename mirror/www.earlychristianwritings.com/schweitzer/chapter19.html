<P>
THE COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE WORK OF WREDE [1] AND THE "SKETCH
of the Life of Jesus" is not more surprising in regard to the time of their
appearance than in regard to the character of their contents. They appeared
upon the self-same day, their titles are almost identical, and their
agreement in the criticism of the modern historical conception of the
life of Jssus extends sometimes to the very phraseology. And yet they
are written from quite different standpoints, one from the point of view
of literary criticism, the other from that of the historical recognition of
eschatology. It seems to be the fate of the Marcan hypothesis that at the
decisive periods its problems should always be attacked simultaneously
and independently from the literary and the historical sides, and the results
declared in two different forms which corroborate each other. So it
was in the case of Weisse and Wilke; so it is again now, when, retaining
the assumption of the priority of Mark, the historicity of the hitherto
accepted view of the life of Jesus, based upon the Marcan narrative, is
called in question.
<P>
[1] William Wrede, bom in 1859 at Bucfcen in Hanover, was Professor at Breslau.
(He died in 1907).
<P>
Wrede names as his real predecessors on the same lines Bruno Bauer, Volkmar,
and the Dutch writer Hoekstra ("De Christologie van het canonieke Marcus-Evangelie,
vergeleken met die van de beide andere synoptische Evangelien," <i>Theol.
Tijdischrift</i>, v, 1871).                                             .
<P>
In a certain limited degree the work of Ernest Havet (<i>Le Christianisme et ses
origines</i>) has a claim to be classed in the same category. His scepticism refers
principally to the entry into Jerusalem and the story of the passion.
<P>
<center>331</center>
<P>
The meaning of that is that the literary and the eschatological view,
which have hitherto been marching parallel, on either flank, to the advance
of modern theology, have now united their forces, brought theology
to a halt, surrounded it, and compelled it to give battle.
<P>
That in the last three or four years so much has been written in which
this enveloping movement has been ignored does not alter the real
position of modern historical theology in the least. The fact is deserving
of notice that during this period the study of the subject has not made
a step in advance, but has kept moving to and fro upon the old lines
with wearisome iteration, and has thrown itself with excessive zeal into
the work of popularisation, simply because it was incapable of advancing.
<P>
And even if it professes gratitude to Wrede for the very interesting
historical point which he has brought into the discussion, and is also
willing to admit that thoroughgoing eschatology has advanced the solution
of many problems, these are mere demonstrations which are quite
inadequate to raise the blockade of modern theology by the allied forces.
Supposing that only a half-nay, only a third-of the critical arguments
which are common to Wrede and the "Sketch of the Life of Jesus"
are sound, then the modern historical view of the history is wholly
ruined.
<P>
The reader of Wrede's book cannot help feeling that here no quarter
is given; and any one who goes carefully through the present writer's
"Sketch" must come to see that between the modern historical and the
eschatological Life of Jesus no compromise is possible.
<P>
Thoroughgoing scepticism and thoroughgoing eschatology may, in
their union, either destroy, or be destroyed by modern historical theology;
but they cannot combine with it and enable it to advance, any
more than they can be advanced by it.
<P>
We are confronted with a decisive issue. As with Strauss's "Life of
Jesus," so with the surprising agreement in the critical basis of these
two schools-we are not here considering the respective solutions which
they offer-there has entered into the domain of the theology of the day
a force with which it cannot possibly ally itself. Its whole territory is
threatened. It must either reconquer it step by step or else surrender it.
It has no longer the right to advance a single assertion until it has taken
up a definite position in regard to the fundamental questions raised by
the new criticism.
<P>
Modern historical theology is no doubt still far from recognising this.
It is warned that the dyke is letting in water and sends a couple of
masons to repair the leak; as if the leak did not mean that the whole
masonry is undermined, and must be rebuilt from the foundation.
<P>
To vary the metaphor, theology comes home to find the broker's marks
<P>
<center>332</center>
<P>
on all the furniture and goes on as before quite comfortably, ignoring
the fact it will lose everything if it does not pay its debts.
<P>
The critical objections which Wrede and the "Sketch" agree in bringing against the modern treatment of the subject are as follows.
<P>
In order to find in Mark the Life of Jesus of which it is in search
modern theology is obliged to read between the lines a whole host of
things, and those often the most important, and then to foist them upon
the text by means of psychological conjecture. It is determined to find
evidence in Mark of a development of Jesus, a development of the disciples,
and a development of the outer circumstances; and professes in
so doing to be only reproducing the views and indications of the
Evangelist. In reality, however, there is not a word of all this in the
Evangelist, and when his interpreters are asked what are the hints and
indications on which they base their assertions they have nothing to
offer save <i>argumenta e silentio</i>.
<P>
Mark knows nothing of any development in Jesus, he knows nothing
of any paedagogic considerations which are supposed to have determined the conduct of Jesus towards the disciples and the people; he
knows nothing of any conflict in the mind of Jesus between a spiritual
and a popular, political Messianic ideal; he does not know, either, that
in this respect there was any difference between the view of Jesus and
that of the people; he knows nothing of the idea that the use of the ass
at the triumphal entry symbolised a non-political Messiahship; he
knows nothing of the idea that the question about the Messiah's being
the Son of David had something to do with this alternative between
political and non-political; he does not know, either, that Jesus explained the secret of the passion to the disciples, nor that they had
any understanding of it; he only knows that from first to last they were
in all respects equally wanting in understanding; he does not know
that the first period was a period of success and the second a period
of failure; he represents the Pharisees and Herodians as (from iii. 6
onwards) resolved upon the death of Jesus, while the people, down to
the very last day when He preached in the temple, are enthusiastically
loyal to Him.
<P>
All these things of which the Evangelist says nothing-and they are
the foundations of the modern view-should first be proved, if proved
they can be; they ought not to be simply read into the text as something
self-evident. For it is just those things which appear so self-evident to
the prevailing critical temper which are in reality the least evident of
all.
<P>
Another hitherto self-evident point-the "historical kernel" which it
has been customary to extract from the narratives-must be given up,
until it is proved, if it is capable of proof, that we can and ought to
distinguish between the kernel and the husk. We may take all that is
<P>
<center>333</center>
<P>
reported as either historical or unhistorical, but, in respect of the definite
predictions of the passion, death, and resurrection, we ought to give up
taking the reference to the passion as historical and letting the rest go;
we may accept the idea of the atoning death, or we may reject it, but
we ought not to ascribe to Jesus a feeble, anaemic version of this idea,
while setting down to the account of the Pauline theology the interpretation of the passion which we actually find in Mark.
<P>
Whatever the results obtained by the aid of the historical kernel, the
method pursued is the same; "it is detached from its context and transformed into something different." "It finally comes to this," says Wrede,
"that each critic retains whatever portion of the traditional sayings can
be fitted into his construction of the facts and his conception of historical possibility and rejects the rest." The psychological explanation of
motive, and the psychological connexion of the events and actions which
such critics have proposed to find in Mark, simply do not exist. That
being so, nothing is to be made out of his account by the application
of a priori psychology. A vast quantity of treasures of scholarship and
erudition, of art and artifice, which the Marcan hypothesis has gathered
into its storehouse in the two generations of its existence to aid it in constructing its life of Jesus has become worthless, and can be of no further
service to true historical research. Theology has been simplified. What
would become of it if that did not happen every hundred years or so?
And the simplification was badly needed, for no one since Strauss had
cleared away its impedimenta.
<P>
Thoroughgoing scepticism and thoroughgoing eschatology, between
them, are compelling theology to read the Marcan text again with simplicity of mind. The simplicity consists in dispensing with the connecting links which it has been accustomed to discover between the sections
of the narrative (pericopes), in looking at each one separately, and
recognising that it is difficult to pass from one to the other.
<>
The material with which it has hitherto been usual to solder the sections together into a life of Jesus will not stand the temperature test.
Exposed to the cold air of critical scepticism it cracks; when the furnace
of eschatology is heated to a certain point the solderings melt. In both
cases the sections all fall apart.
<P>
Formerly it was possible to book through-tickets at the supplementary-psychological-knowledge office which enabled those travelling in the
interests of Life-of-Jesus construction to use express trains, thus avoiding the inconvenience of having to stop at every little station, change,
and run the risk of missing their connexion. This ticket office is now
closed. There is a station at the end of each section of the narrative, and
the connexlons are not guaranteed.
<P>
The fact is, it is not simply that there is no very obvious psychological
connexion between the sections; in almost every case there is a positive
<P>
<center>334</center>
<P>
break in the connexion. And there is a great deal in the Marcan narrative
which is inexplicable and even self-contradictory.
<P>
In their statement of the problems raised by this want of connexion
Wrede and the "Sketch" are in the most exact agreement. That these
difficulties are not artificially constructed has been shown by our survey
of the history of the attempts to write the Life of Jesus, in the course
of which these problems emerge one after another, after Bruno Bauer
had by anticipation grasped them all in their complexity.
<P>
How do the demoniacs know that Jesus is the Son of God? Why
does the blind man at Jericho address Him as the Son of David, when
no one else knows His Messianic dignity? How was it that these occurrences did not give a new direction to the thoughts of the people in
regard to Jesus? How did the Messianic entry come about? How was
it possible without provoking the interference of the Roman garrison
of occupation? Why is it as completely ignored in the subsequent controversies as if it had never taken place? Why was it not brought up at
the trial of Jesus? "The Messianic acclamation at the entry into Jerusalem," says Wrede, "is in Mark quite an isolated incident. It has no
sequel, neither is there any preparation for it beforehand."
<P>
Why does Jesus in Mark iv. 10-12 speak of the parabolic form of discourse as designed to conceal the mystery of the Kingdom of God,
whereas the explanation which He proceeds to give to the disciples has
nothing mysterious about it? What is the mystery of the Kingdom of
God? Why does Jesus forbid His miracles to be made known even in
cases where there is no apparent purpose for the prohibition? Why is
His Messiahship a secret and yet no secret, since it is known, not only
to the disciples, but to the demoniacs, the blind man at Jericho, the
multitude at Jerusalem-which must, as Bruno Bauer expresses it, "have
fallen from heaven"-and to the High Priest?
<P>
Why does Jesus first reveal His Messiahship to the disciples at
Caesarea Philippi, not at the moment when He sends them forth to
preach? How does Peter know without having been told by Jesus that
the Messiahship belongs to his Master? Why must it remain a secret
until the "resurrection"? Why does Jesus indicate His Messiahship only
by the title Son of Man? And why is it that this title is so far from
prominent in primitive Christian theology?
<P>
What is the meaning of the statement that Jesus at Jerusalem discovered a difficulty in the fact that the Messiah was described as at once
David's son and David's Lord? How are we to explain the fact that
Jesus had to open the eyes of the people to the greatness of the Baptist's
office, subsequently to the mission of the Twelve, and to enlighten the
disciples themselves in regard to it during the descent from the mount
of transfiguration? Why should this be described in Matt. xi. 14 and 15
<P>
<center>335</center>
<P>
as a mystery difficult to grasp ("If ye can receive it" . . . "He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear")? What is the meaning of the saying that he
that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than the Baptist? Does
the Baptist, then, not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven? How is the
Kingdom of Heaven subjected to violence since the days of the Baptist?
Who are the violent? What is the Baptist intended to understand from
the answer of Jesus?
<P>
What importance was attached to the miracles by Jesus Himself?
What office must they have caused the people to attribute to Him?
Why is the discourse at the sending out of the Twelve filled with predictions
of persecutions which experience had given no reason to anticipate, and which did not, as a matter of fact, occur? What is the meaning
of the saying in Matt. x. 23 about the imminent coming of the Son of
Man, seeing that the disciples after all returned to Jesus without its being fulfilled? Why does Jesus leave the people just when His work
among them is most successful, and journey northwards? Why had He,
immediately after the sending forth of the Twelve, manifested a desire
to withdraw Himself from the multitude who were longing for salvation?
<P>
How does the multitude mentioned in Mark viii. 34 suddenly appear
at Caesarea Philippi? Why is its presence no longer implied in Mark
ix. 30? How could Jesus possibly have travelled unrecognised through
Galilee, and how could He have avoided being thronged in Capernaum
although He stayed at "the house"?
<P>
How came He so suddenly to speak to His disciples of His suffering
and dying and rising again, without, moreover, explaining to them either
the natural or the moral "wherefore"? "There is no trace of any attempt on the part of Jesus," says Wrede, "to break this strange thought
gradually to His disciples . . . the prediction is always flung down before the disciples without preparation, it is, in fact, a characteristic
feature of these sayings that all attempt to aid the understanding of the
disciples is lacking."
<P>
Did Jesus journey to Jerusalem with the purpose of working there,
or of dying there? How comes it that in Mark x. 39, He holds out to the
sons of Zebedee the prospect of drinking His cup and being baptized
with His baptism? And how can He, after speaking so decidedly of the
necessity of His death, think it possible in Gethsemane that the cup
might yet pass from Him? Who are the undefined "many," for whom,
according to Mark x. 45 and xiv. 24, His death shall serve as a ransom? [1]
<P>
[1] These and the following questions are raised more especially in the <i>Sketch
of the Life of Jesus</i>.
<P>
<center>336</center>
<P>
How came it that Jesus alone was arrested? Why were no witness
called at His trial to testify that He had given Himself out to be the Messiah? How is it that on the morning after His arrest the temper of the
multitude seems to be completely changed, so that no one stirs a finger
to help Him?
<P>
In what form does Jesus conceive the resurrection, which He promises
to His disciples, to be combined with the coming on the clouds of heaven
to which He points His judge? In what relation do these predictions
stand to the prospect held out at the time of the sending forth of the
Twelve, but not realized, of the immediate appearance of the Son of
Man?
<P>
What is the meaning of the further prediction on the way to Gethsemane
(Mark xiv. 28) that after His resurrection He will go before
the disciples into Galilee? How is the other version of this saying (Mark
xvi. 7) to be explained, according to which it means, as spoken by the
angel, that the disciples are to journey to Galilee to have their first meeting
with the risen Jesus there, whereas, on the lips of Jesus, it betokened
that, just as now as a sufferer He was going before them from Galilee to
Jerusalem, so, after His resurrection, He would go before them from
Jerusalem to Galilee? And what was to happen there?
<P>
These problems were covered up by the naturalistic psychology as by
a light snow-drift. The snow has melted, and they now stand out from
the narratives like black points of rock. It is no longer allowable to
avoid these questions, or to solve them, each by itself, by softening them
down and giving them an interpretation by which the reported facts
acquire a quite different significance from that which they bear for
the Evangelist. Either the Marcan text as it stands is historical, and
therefore to be retained, or it is not, and then it should be given up.
What is really unhistorical is any softening down of the wording, and
the meaning which it naturally bears.
<P>
The sceptical and eschatological schools, however, go still farther in
company. If the connexion in Mark is really no connexion, it is important to try to discover whether any principle can be discovered in
this want of connexion. Can any order be brought into the chaos? To
this the answer is in the affirmative.
<P>
The complete want of connexion, with all its self-contradictions, is
ultimately due to the fact that two representations of the life of Jesus,
or, to speak more accurately, of His public ministry, are here crushed
into one; a natural and a deliberately supernatural representation. A
dogmatic element has intruded itself into the description of this Life-something which has no concern with the events which form the outward
course of that Life. This dogmatic element is the Messianic secret of
Jesus and all the secrets and concealments which go along with it.
<P>
<center>337</center>
<P>
Hence the irrational and self-contradictory features of the presentation
of Jesus, out of which a rational psychology can make only something
which is unhistorical and does violence to the text, since it must
necessarily get rid of the constant want of connexion and self-contradiction
which belongs to the essence of the narrative, and portray a
Jesus who was the Messiah, not one who at once was and was not Messiah
as the Evangelist depicts Him. When rational psychology conceives
Him as one who was Messiah, but not in the sense expected by the
people, that is a concession to the self-contradictions of the Marcan representation; which, however, does justice neither to the text nor to the
history which it records, since the Gospel does not contain the faintest
hint that the contradiction was of this nature.
<P>
Up to this point-up to the complete reconstruction of the system
which runs through the disconnectedness, and the tracing back of the
dogmatic element to the Messianic secret-there extends a close agreement
between thoroughgoing scepticism and thoroughgoing eschatology.
The critical arguments are identical, the construction is analogous and
based on the same principle. The defenders of the modern psychological
view cannot, therefore, play off one school against the other, as one of
them proposed to do, but must deal with them both at once. They
differ only when they explain whence the system that runs through the
disconnectedness comes. Here the ways divide, as Bauer saw long ago.
The inconsistency between the public life of Jesus and His Messianic
claim lies either in the nature of the Jewish Messianic conception, or
in the representation of the Evangelist. There is, on the one hand, the
eschatological solution, which at one stroke raises the Marcan account
as it stands, with all its disconnectedness and inconsistencies, into genuine history; and there is, on the other hand, the literary solution, which
regards the incongruous dogmatic element as interpolated by the earliest
Evangelist into the tradition and therefore strikes out the Messianic
claim altogether from the historical Life of Jesus. <i>Tertium non datur</i>.
<P>
But in some respects it really hardly matters which of the two "solutions"
one adopts. They are both merely wooden towers erected upon
the solid main building of the consentient critical induction which offers
the enigmas detailed above to modern historical theology. It is interesting in this connexion that Wrede's scepticism is just as constructive as
the eschatological outline of the Life of Jesus in the "Sketch."
<P>
Bruno Bauer chose the literary solution because he thought that we
had no evidence for an eschatological expectation existing in the time
of Christ. Wrede, though he follows Johannes Weiss in assuming the
existence of a Jewish eschatological Messianic expectation, finds in the
Gospel only the Christian conception of the Messiah. "If Jesus," he
thinks, "really knew Himself to be the Messiah and designated Himself
<P>
<center>338</center>
<P>
as such, the genuine tradition is so closely interwoven with later accretions that it is not easy to recognise it." In any case, Jesus cannot, according to Wrede, have spoken of His Messianic Coming in the way
which the Synoptists report. The Messiahship of Jesus, as we find it in
the Gospels, is a product of Early Christian theology correcting history
according to its own conceptions.
<P>
It is therefore necessary to distinguish in Mark between the reported
events which constitute the outward course of the history of Jesus, and
the dogmatic idea which claims to lay down the lines of its inward
course. The principle of division is found in the contradictions.
<P>
The recorded events form, according to Wrede, the following picture.
Jesus came forward as a teacher, [1] first and principally in Galilee. He
was surrounded by a company of disciples, went about with them, and
gave them instruction. To some of them He accorded a special confidence.
A larger multitude sometimes attached itself to Him, in addition
to the disciples. He is fond of discoursing in parables. Besides the teaching
there are the miracles. These make a stir, and He is thronged by
the multitudes. He gives special attention to the cases of demoniacs. He
is in such close touch with the people that He does not hesitate to associate even with publicans and sinners. Towards the Law He takes up
an attitude of some freedom. He encounters the opposition of the Pharisees and the Jewish authorities. They set traps for Him and endeavour
to bring about His fall. Finally they succeed, when He ventures to show
Himself not only on Judaean soil, but in Jerusalem. He remains passive
and is condemned to death. The Roman administration supports the
Jewish authorities.
<P>
"The texture of the Marcan narrative as we know it," continues
Wrede, "is not complete until to the warp of these general historical notions there is added a strong weft of ideas of a dogmatic character,
the substance of which is that "Jesus, the bearer of a special office to
which He was appointed by God," becomes "a higher, superhuman being." If this is the case, however, then "the motives of His conduct are
not derived from human characteristics, human aims and necessities."
"The one motive which runs throughout is rather a Divine decree which
lies beyond human understanding. This He seeks to fulfil alike in His
actions and His sufferings. The teaching of Jesus is accordingly supernatural." On this assumption the want of understanding of the disciples
to whom He communicates, without commentary, unconnected portions
of this supernatural knowledge becomes natural and explicable. The
people are, moreover, essentially "non-receptive of revelation."
<P>
"It is these <i>motifs</i> and not those which are inherently historical which
<P>
[1] It would perhaps be more historical to say "as a prophet."
<P>
<center>339</center>
<P>
give movement and direction to the Marcan narrative. It is they that give
the general colour. On them naturally depends the main interest, it is
to them that the thought of the writer is really directed. The consequence
is that the general picture offered by the Gospel is not an historical representation of the Life of Jesus. Only some faded remnants
of such an impression have been taken over into a supra-historical religious view. In this sense the Gospel of Mark belongs to the history of
dogma."
<P>
The two conceptions of the Life of Jesus, the natural and the supernatural, are brought, not without inconsistencies, into a kind of harmony
by means of the idea of intentional secrecy. The Messiahship of Jesus
is concealed in His life as in a closed dark lantern, which, however,
is not quite closed-otherwise one could not see that it was there-and
allows a few bright beams to escape.
<P>
The idea of a secret which must remain a secret until the resurrection
of Jesus could only arise at a time when nothing was known of a Messianic
claim of Jesus during His life upon earth: that is to say, at a time
when the Messiahship of Jesus was thought of as beginning with the
resurrection. But that is a weighty piece of indirect historical evidence
that Jesus did not really profess to be the Messiah at all.
<P>
The positive fact which is to be inferred from this is that the appearances of the risen Jesus produced a sudden revolution in His disciples' conception of Him. "The resurrection" is for Wrede the real
Messianic event in the Life of Jesus.
<P>
Who is responsible, then, for introducing this singular feature, so
destructive of the real historical connexion, into the life of Jesus, which
was in reality that of a teacher? It is quite impossible, Wrede argues,
that the idea of the Messianic secret is the invention of Mark. "A thing
like that is not done by a single individual. It must, therefore, have been
a view which was current in certain circles, and was held by a considerable number, though not necessarily perhaps by a very great number of persons. To say this is not to deny that Mark had a share and perhaps a considerable share in the creation of the view which he sets forth
. . . the motifs themselves are doubtless not, in part at least, peculiar
to the Evangelist, but the concrete embodiment of them is certainly his
own work; and to this extent we may speak of a special Marcan point
of view which manifests itself here and there. Where the line is to be
drawn between what is traditional and what is individual cannot always
be determined even by a careful examination directed to this end. We
must leave it commingled, as we find it."
<P>
The Marcan narrative has therefore arisen from the impulse to give
a Messianic form to the earthly life of Jesus. This impulse was, however,
restrained by the impression and tradition of the non-Messianic char-
<P>
<center>340</center>
<P>
acter of the life of Jesus, which were still strong and vivid, and it was
therefore not able wholly to recast the material, but could only bore
its way into it and force it apart, as the roots of the bramble disintegrate
a rock. In the Gospel literature which arose on the basis of Mark the
Messianic secret becomes gradually of more subordinate importance and
the life of Jesus more Messianic in character, until in the Fourth Gospel
He openly comes before the people with Messianic claims.
<P>
In estimating the value of this construction we must not attach too
much importance to its a priori assumptions and difficulties. In this respect Wrede's position is much more precarious than that of his precursor Bruno Bauer. According to the latter the interpolation of the
Messianic secret is the personal, absolutely original act of the Evangelist.
Wrede thinks of it as a collective act, representing the new conception
as moulded by the tradition before it was fixed by the Evangelist. That
is very much more difficult to carry through. Tradition alters its materials in a different way from that in which we find them altered in
Mark. Tradition transforms from without. Mark's way of drawing secret
threads of a different material through the texture of the tradition,
without otherwise altering it, is purely literary, and could only be the
work of an individual person.
<P>
A creative tradition would have carried out the theory of the Messianic secret in the life of Jesus much more boldly and logically, that
is to say, at once more arbitrarily and more consistently.
<P>
The only alternative is to distinguish two stages of tradition in early
Christianity, a naive, freely-working, earlier stage, and a more artificial
later stage confined to a smaller circle of a more literary character.
Wrede does, as a matter of fact, propose to find in Mark traces of a
simpler and bolder transformation which, leaving aside the Messianic
secret, makes Jesus an openly-professed Messiah, and is therefore of a
distinct origin from the conception of the secret Christ. To this tradition may belong, he thinks, the entry into Jerusalem and the confession
before the High Priest, since these narratives "naively" imply an openly
avowed Messiahship.
<P>
The word "naively" is out of place here; a really naive tradition
which intended to represent the entry of Jesus as Messianic would have
done so in quite a different way from Mark, and would not have stultified itself so curiously as we find done even in Matthew, where the
Galilaean Passover pilgrims, after the "Messianic entry," answer the
question of the people of Jerusalem as to who it was whom they were
acclaiming, with the words "This is the Prophet Jesus from Nazareth
of Galileo" (Matt. xxi. 11).
<P>
The tradition, too, which makes Jesus acknowledge His Messiahstiip
<P>
<center>341</center>
<P>
before His judges is not "naive" in Wrede's sense, for, if it were, it
would not represent the High Priest's knowledge of Jesus' Messiahship
as something so extraordinary and peculiar to himself that he can cite
witnesses only for the saying about the Temple, not with reference to
Jesus' Messianic claim, and bases his condemnation only on the fact
that Jesus in answer to his question acknowledges Himself as Messiah
- and Jesus does so, it should be remarked, as in other passages, with
an appeal to a future justification of His claim. The confession before
the council is therefore anything but a "naive representation of an
openly avowed Messiahship."
<P>
The Messianic statements in these two passages present precisely the
same remarkable character as in all the other cases to which Wrede
draws attention. We have not here to do with a different tradition, with
a clear Messianic light streaming in through the window-pane, but,
just as elsewhere, with the rays of a dark lantern. The real point is that
Wrede cannot bring these two passages within the lines of the theory
of secrecy, and practically admits this by assuming the existence of a
second and rather divergent line of tradition. What concerns us is to
note that this theory does not suffice to explain the two facts in question, the knowledge of Jesus' Messiahship shown by the Galilaean Passover pilgrims at the time of the entry into Jerusalem, and the knowledge
of the High Priest at His trial.
<P>
We can only touch on the question whether any one who wished to
date back in some way or other the Messiahship into the life of Jesus
could not have done it much more simply by making Jesus give His
closest followers some hints regarding it. Why does the re-moulder of
the history, instead of doing that, have recourse to a supernatural
knowledge on the part of the demoniacs and the disciples? For Wrede
rightly remarks, as Bruno Bauer and the "Sketch" also do, that the incident of Caesarea Philippi, as represented by Mark, involves a miracle,
since Jesus does not, as is generally supposed, reveal His Messiahship to
Peter; it is Peter who reveals it to Jesus (Mark viii. 29). This fact,
however, makes nonsense of the whole theory about the disciples' want
of understanding. It will not therefore fit into the concealment theory,
and Wrede, as a matter of fact, feels obliged to give up that theory as
regards this incident. "This scene," he remarks, "can hardly have been
created by Mark himself." It also, therefore, belongs to another tradition.
<P>
Here, then, is a third Messianic fact which cannot be brought within
the lines of Wrede's "literary" theory of the Messianic secret. And these
three facts are precisely the most important of all: Peter's confession,
the Entry into Jerusalem, and the High Priest's knowledge of Jesus'
Messiahship! In each case Wrede finds himself obliged to refer these to
<P>
<center>342</center>
<P>
tradition instead of to the literary conception of Mark. [1] This tradition
undermines his literary hypothesis, for the conception of a tradition
always involves the possibility of genuine historical elements.
<P>
How greatly this inescapable intrusion of tradition weakens the theory
of the literary interpolation of the Messiahship into the history, becomes
evident when we consider the story of the passion. The representation
that Jesus was publicly put to death as Messiah because He had
publicly acknowledged Himself to be so, must, like the High Priest's
knowledge of His claim, be referred to the other tradition which has
nothing to do with the Messianic secret, but boldly antedates the Messiahship
without employing any finesse of that kind. But that strongly
tends to confirm the historicity of this tradition, and throws the burden
of proof upon those who deny it. It is wholly independent of the hypothesis of secrecy, and in fact directly opposed to it. If, on the other
hand, in spite of all the difficulties, the representation that Jesus was
condemned to death on account of His Messianic claims is dragged by
main force into the theory of secrecy, the question arises: What interest
had the persons who set up the literary theory of secrecy, in representing
Jesus as having been openly put to death as Messiah and in consequence of His Messianic claims? And the answer is: "None whatever:
quite the contrary." For in doing so the theory of secrecy stultifies
itself. As though one were to develop a photographic plate with painful
care and, just when one had finished, fling open the shutters, so, on this
hypothesis, the natural Messianic light suddenly shines into the room
which ought to be lighted only by the rays of the dark lantern.
<P>
Here, therefore, the theory of secrecy abandoned the method which
it had hitherto followed in regard to the traditional material. For if
Jesus was not condemned and crucified at Jerusalem as Messiah, a tradition must have existed which preserved the truth about the last conflicts, and the motives of the condemnation. This is supposed to have
been here completely set aside by the theory of the secret Messiahship,
which, instead of drawing its delicate threads through the older tradition, has simply substituted its own representation of events. But in that
case why not do away with the remainder of the public ministry? why
not at least get rid of the public appearance at Jerusalem? How can
the crudeness of method shown in the case of the passion be harmonised
<P>
[1] The difficulties which the incident at Caesarea Philippi places in the way of
Wrede's construction may be realised by placing two of his statements side oy
side. P. 101: "From this it is evident that this incident contains no element
which cannot be easily understood on the basis of Mark's ideas." P. 238:
"But
in another aspect this incident stands in direct contradiction to the Marcan view
of the disciples. It is inconsistent with their general 'want of understanding,' and
can therefore hardly have been created by Mark himself."
<P>
<center>343</center>
<P>
with the skilful conservatism towards the non-Messianic tradition which
it is obvious that the "Marcan circle" has scrupulously observed elsewhere?
<P>
If according to the original tradition, of which Wrede admits the
existence, Jesus went to Jerusalem not to die, but to work there, the
dogmatic view, according to which He went to Jerusalem to die, must
have struck out the whole account of His sojourn in Jerusalem and His
death in order to put something else in its place. What we now read in
the Gospels concerning those last days in Jerusalem cannot be derived
from the original tradition, for one who came to work, and, according to
Wrede "to work with decisive effect," would not have cast all His
preaching into the form of obscure parables of judgment and minatory
discourses. That is a style of speech which could be adopted only by one
who was determined to force his adversaries to put him to death. Therefore
the narrative of the last days of Jesus must be, from beginning to
end, a creation of the dogmatic idea. And, as a matter of fact, Wrede,
here in agreement with Weisse, "sees grounds for asserting that the sojourn
at Jerusalem is presented to us in the Gospels in a very much
abridged and weakened version." That is a euphemistic expression, for
if it was really the dogmatic idea which was responsible for representing
Jesus as being condemned as Messiah, it is not a mere case of "abridging
and weakening down," but of displacing the tradition in favour of a
new one.
<P>
But if Jesus was not condemned as Messiah, on what grounds was He
condemned? And, again, what interest had those whose concern was
to make the Messiahship a secret of His earthly life, in making Him die
as Messiah, contrary to the received tradition? And what interest could
the tradition have had in falsifying history in that way? Even admitting
that the prediction of the passion to the disciples is of a dogmatic character,
and is to be regarded as a creation of primitive Christian theology,
the historic fact that He died would have been a sufficient fulfilment
of those sayings. That He was publicly condemned and crucified
as Messiah has nothing to do with the fulfilment of those predictions, and
goes far beyond it.
<P>
To take a more general point: what interest had primitive theology
ln dating back the Messiahship of Jesus to the time of His earthly
ministry? None whatever. Paul shows us with what complete indifference
the earthly life of Jesus was regarded by primitive Christianity. The
discourses in Acts show an equal indifference, since in them also Jesus
first becomes the Messiah by virtue of His exaltation. To date the Messiahship
earlier was not an undertaking which offered any advantage
to primitive theology, in fact it would only have raised difficulties for it,
since it involved the hypothesis of a dual Messiahship, one of earthly
<P>
<center>344</center>
<P>
humiliation and one of future glory. The fact is, if one reads through
the early literature one becomes aware that so long as theology had an
eschatological orientation and was dominated by the expectation of the
Parousia the question of how Jesus of Nazareth "had been" the Messiah
not only did not exist, but was impossible. Primitive theology is simply
a theology of the future, with no interest in history! It was only with the
decline of eschatological interest and the change in the orientation of
Christianity which was connected therewith that an interest in the life of
Jesus and the "historical Messiahship" arose.
<P>
That is to say, the Gnostics, who were the first to assert the Messiahship
of the historical Jesus, and who were obliged to assert it precisely
because they denied the eschatological conceptions, forced this
view upon the theology of the Early Church, and compelled it to create
in the Logos Christology an un-Gnostic mould in which to cast the
speculative conception of the historical Messiahship of Jesus; and that
is what we find in the Fourth Gospel. Prior to the anti-Gnostic controversies
we find in the early Christian literature no conscious dating
back of the Messiahship of Jesus to His earthly life, and no theological
interest at work upon the dogmatic recasting of His history. [1] It is therefore
difficult to suppose that the Messianic secret in Mark, that is to say,
in the very earliest tradition, was derived from primitive theology.
The assertion of the Messiahship of Jesus was wholly independent of
the latter. The instinct which led Bruno Bauer to explain the Messianic
secret as the literary invention of Mark himself was therefore quite
correct. Once suppose that tradition and primitive theology have anything to do with the matter, and the theory of the interpolation of the
Messiahship into the history becomes almost impossible to carry
through. But Wrede's greatness consists precisely in the fact that he was
compelled by his acute perception of the significance of the critical
data to set aside the purely literary version of the hypothesis and make
Mark, so to speak, the instrument of the literary realisation of the ideas
of a definite intellectual circle within the sphere of primitive theology.
<P>
The positive difficulty which confronts the sceptical theory is to explain how the Messianic beliefs of the first generation arose, if Jesus,
throughout His life, was for all, even for the disciples, merely a
"teacher," and gave even His intimates no hint of the dignity which He
claimed for Himself. It is difficult to eliminate the Messiahship from the
"Life of Jesus," especially from the narrative of the passion; it is more
difficult still, as Keim saw long ago, to bring it back again after its
<P>
[1] The question of the attitude of pre-Origenic theology towards the historic
Jesus, and of the influence exercised by dogma upon the evangelical tradition
regarding Jesus in the course of the first two centuries, is certainly deserving of a
detailed examination.
<P>
<center>345</center>
<P>
elimination from the "Life" into the theology of the primitive Church.
In Wrede's acute and logical thinking this difficulty seems to leap to
light.
<P>
Since the Messianic secret in Mark is always connected with the
resurrection, the date at which the Messianic belief of the disciples arose
must be the resurrection of Jesus. "But the idea of dating the Messiahship
from the resurrection is certainly not a thought of Jesus, but of the
primitive Church. It presupposes the Church's experience of the appearance of the risen Jesus."
<P>
The psychologist will say that the "resurrection experiences," however they may be conceived, are only intelligible as based upon the
expectation of the resurrection, and this again as based on references
of Jesus to the resurrection. But leaving psychology aside, let us accept
the resurrection experiences of the disciples as a pure psychological
miracle. Even so, how can the appearances of the risen Jesus have
suggested to the disciples the idea that Jesus, the crucified teacher, was
the Messiah? Apart from any expectations, how can this conclusion
have resulted for them from the mere "fact of the resurrection"? The
fact of the appearance did not by any means imply it. In certain circles,
indeed, according to Mark vi. 14-16, in the very highest quarters, the
resurrection of the Baptist was believed in; but that did not make John
the Baptist the Messiah. The inexplicable thing is that, according to
Wrede, the disciples began at once to assert confidently and unanimously that He was the Messiah and would before long appear in glory.
<P>
But how did the appearance of the risen Jesus suddenly become for
them a proof of His Messiahship and the basis of their eschatology?
That Wrede fails to explain, and so makes this "event" an "historical"
miracle which in reality is harder to believe than the supernatural event.
<P>
Any one who holds "historical" miracles to be just as impossible as
any other kind, even when they occur in a critical and sceptical work,
will be forced to the conclusion that the Messianic eschatological significance attached to the "resurrection experience" by the disciples implies some kind of Messianic eschatological references on the part of
the historical Jesus which gave to the "resurrection" its Messianic eschatological significance. Here Wrede himself, though without admitting it,
postulates some Messianic hints on the part of Jesus, since he conceives the judgment of the disciples upon the resurrection to have been not analytical, but synthetic, inasmuch as they add something to it, and
that, indeed, the main thing, which was not implied in the conception
of the event as such.
<P>
Here again the merit of Wrede's contribution to criticism consists
in the fact that he takes the position as it is and does not try to improve
it artificially. Bruno Bauer and others supposed that the belief in the
<P>
<center>346</center>
<P>
Messiahship of Jesus had slowly solidified out of a kind of gaseous state
or had been forced into primitive theology by the literary invention of
Mark. Wrede, however, feels himself obliged to base it upon an historical
fact, and, moreover, the same historical fact which is pointed to by the
sayings in the Synoptics and the Pauline theology. But in so doing he
creates an almost insurmountable difficulty for his hypothesis.
<P>
We can only briefly refer to the question what form the accounts of
the resurrection must have taken if the historic fact which underlay
them was the first surprised apprehension and recognition of the Messiahship
of Jesus on the part of the disciples. The Messianic teaching
would necessarily in that case have been somehow or other put into the
mouth of the risen Jesus. It is, however, completely absent, because
it was already contained in the teaching of Jesus during His earthly
life. The theory of Messianic secrecy must therefore have re-moulded
not merely the story of the passion, but also that of the resurrection,
removing the revelation of the Messiahship to the disciples from the
latter in order to insert it into the public ministry!
<P>
Wrede, moreover, will only take account of the Marcan text as it
stands, not of the historical possibility that the "futuristic Messiahship"
which meets us in the mysterious utterances of Jesus goes back in some
form to a sound tradition. Further he does not take the eschatological
character of the teaching of Jesus into his calculations, but works on the
false assumption that he can analyse the Marcan text in and by itself
and so discover the principle on which it is composed. He carries out
experiments on the law of crystallisation of the narrative material in
this Gospel, but instead of doing so in the natural and historical atmosphere
he does it in an atmosphere artificially neutralised, which contains
no trace of contemporary conceptions. [1] Consequently the conclusion
based on the sum of his observations has in it something arbi-
<P>
[1] Certain of the conceptions with which Wrede operates are simply not in
accordance with the text, because he gives them a different significance from that
which they have in the narrative. Thus, for example, he always takes the "resurrection,"
when it occurs in the mouth of Jesus, as a reference to that resurrection
which as an historical fact became a matter of apprehended experience to the
apostles. But Jesus speaks without any distinction of His resurrection and of
His Parousia. The conception of the resurrection, therefore, if one is to arrive at it
inductively from the Marcan text, is most closely bound up with the Parousia. The
Evangelist would thus seem to have made Jesus predict a different kind of resurrection
from that which actually happened. The resurrection, according to the
Marcan text, is an eschatological event, and has no reference whatever to Wrede's
"historical resurrection." Further, if their resurrection experience was the first and
fundamental point in the Messianic enlightenment of the disciples, why did they
only begin to proclaim it some weeks later? This is a problem which was long ago
recognised by Reimarus, and which is not solved by merely assuming that the
disciples were afraid.
<P>
<center>347</center>
<P>
trary. Everything which conflicts with the rational construction of the
course of the history is referred directly to the theory of the concealment of the Messianic secret. But in the carrying out of that theory a
number of self-contradictions, without which it could not subsist, must
be recognised and noted.
<P>
Thus, for example, all the prohibitions, [1] whatever they may refer to,
even including the command not to make known His miracles, are referred
to the same category as the injunction not to reveal the Messianic secret.
But what justification is there for that? It presupposes that
according to Mark the miracles could be taken as proofs of the Messiahship,
an idea of which there is no hint whatever in Mark. "The miracles,"
Wrede argues, "are certainly used by the earliest Christians as evidence
of the nature and significance of Christ. ... I need hardly point to
the fact that Mark, not less than Matthew, Luke, and John, must have
held the opinion that the miracles of Jesus encountered a wide-spread
and ardent Messianic expectation."
<P>
In John this Messianic significance of the miracles is certainly assumed;
but then the really eschatological view of things has here fallen
into the background. It seems indeed as if genuine eschatology excluded
the Messianic interpretation of the miracles. In Matthew the miracles
of Jesus have nothing whatever to do with the proof of the Messiahship,
but, as is evident from the saying about Chorazin and Bethsaida, Matt.
xi. 20-24, are only an exhibition of mercy intended to awaken repentance,
or, according to Matt. xii. 28, an indication of the nearness
of the Kingdom of God. They have as little to do with the Messianic
office as in the Acts of the Apostles. [2] In Mark, from first to last, there is
not a single syllable to suggest that the miracles have a Messianic significance.
Even admitting the possibility that the "miracles of Jesus encountered
an ardent Messianic expectation," that does not necessarily
imply a Messianic significance in them. To justify that conclusion requires
the pre-supposition that the Messiah was expected to be some
<P>
[1] P. 33 ff. The prohibitions in Mark i. 43 and 44, v. 43, vii. 36, and viii. 26 are
put on the same footing with the really Messianic prohibitions in viii. 30 and ix.
9, with which may be associated also the imposition of silence upon the demoniacs
who recognise his Messiahship in Mark i. 34 and iii. 12.
<P>
[2] The narrative in Matt. xiv. 22-33, according to which the disciples, after seeing
Jesus walk upon the sea, hail Him on His coming into the boat as the Son of God,
and the description of the deeds of Jesus as "deeds of Christ," in the introduction to
the Baptist's question in Matt. xi. 2, do not cancel the old theory even in Matthew,
because the Synoptists, differing therein from the fourth Evangelist, do not represent
the demand for a sign as a demand for a Messianic sign, nor the cures wrought by
Jesus as Messianic proofs of power. The action of the demons in crying out upon
Jesus as the son of God betokens their recognition of Him; it has nothing to do
wlth the miracles of healing as such.
<P>
<center>348</center>
<P>
kind of an earthly man who should do miracles. This is presupposed
by Wrede, by Bruno Bauer, and by modern theology in general but
it has not been proved, and it is at variance with eschatology, which
pictured the Messiah to itself as a heavenly being in a world which was
already being transformed into something supra-mundane.
<P>
The assumption that the clue to the explanation of the command not
to make known the miracles is to be found in the necessity of guarding
the secret of the Messiahship is, therefore, not justified. The miracles
are connected with the Kingdom and the nearness of the Kingdom, not
with the Messiah. But Wrede is obliged to refer everything to the Messianic
secret, because he leaves the preaching of the Kingdom out of
account.
<P>
The same process is repeated in the discussion of the veiling of the
mystery of the Kingdom of God in the parables of Mark iv. The mystery
of the Kingdom is for Wrede the secret of Jesus' Messiahship. "We have
learned in the meantime," he says, "that one main element in this
mystery is that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. If Jesus, according
to Mark, conceals his Messiahship, we are justified in interpreting the
<font face="Symbol">musthrion thV basileiaV tou qeou</font> in the light of this fact."
<P>
That is one of the weakest points in Wrede's whole theory. Where
is there any hint of this in these parables? And why should the secret
of the Kingdom of God contain within it as one of its principal features
the secret of the Messiahship of Jesus?
<P>
"Mark's account of Jesus' parabolic teaching," he concludes, "is
completely unhistorical," because it is directly opposed to the essential
nature of the parables. The ultimate reason, according to Wrede, why
this whole view of the parables arose, was simply "because the general
opinion was already in existence that Jesus had revealed Himself to
the disciples, but concealed Himself from the multitude."
<P>
Instead of simply admitting that we are unable to discover what the
mystery of the Kingdom in Mark iv. is, any more than we can understand why it must be veiled, and numbering it among the unsolved
problems of Jesus' preaching of the Kingdom, Wrede forces this chapter
inside the lines of his theory of the veiled Messiahship.
<P>
The desire of Jesus to be alone, too, and remain unrecognised (Mark
vii. 24, and ix. 30 ff.) is supposed to have some kind of connexion with
Messiahship. He even brings the multitude, which in
Mark x. 47 ff. rebukes the blind beggar at Jericho who cried out to
Jesus, into the service of his theory . . . on the ground that the beggar
had addressed Him as Son of David. But all the narrative says is that
they told him to hold his peace-to cease making an outcry-not that
they did so because of his addressing Jesus as "Son of David."
<P>
In an equally arbitrary fashion the surprising introduction of the
<P>
<center>349</center>
<P>
"multitude" in Mark viii. 34, after the incident of Caesarea Philippi,
is dragged into the theory of secrecy. [1] Wrede does not feel the possibility
or impossibility of the sudden appearance of the multitude in this
locality as an historical problem, any more than he grasps the sudden
withdrawal of Jesus from His public ministry as primarily an historical
question. Mark is for him a writer who is to be judged from a pathological point of view, a writer who, dominated by the fixed idea of introducing everywhere the Messianic secret of Jesus, is always creating
mysterious and unintelligible situations, even when these do not directly
serve the interests of his theory, and who in some of his descriptions,
writes in a rather "fairy-tale" style. When all is said, his treatment of
the history scarcely differs from that of the fourth Evangelist.
<P>
The absence of historical prepossessions which Wrede skilfully assumes in his examination of the connexion in Mark is not really complete. He is bound to refer everything inexplicable to the principle of
the concealment of the Messiahship, which is the only principle that he
recognises in the dogmatic stratum of the narrative, and is consequently
obliged to deny the historicity of such passages, whereas in reality the
veiling of the Messiahship is only involved in a few places and is there
indicated in clear and simple words. He is unwilling to recognise that
there is a second, wider circle of mystery which has to do, not with Jesus'
Messiahship, but with His preaching of the Kingdom, with the mystery
of the Kingdom of God in the wider sense, and that within this second
circle there lie a number of historical problems, above all the mission
of the Twelve and the inexplicable abandonment of public activity on
the part of Jesus which followed soon afterwards. His mistake consists
in endeavouring by violent methods to subsume the more general, the
mystery of the Kingdom of God, under the more special, the mystery of
the Messiahship, instead of inserting the latter as the smaller circle,
within the wider, the secret of the Kingdom of God.
<P>
As he does not deal with the teaching of Jesus, he has no occasion
to take account of the secret of the Kingdom of God. That is the more
remarkable because corresponding to one fundamental idea of the Messianic secret there is a parallel, more general dogmatic conception in
Jesus' preaching of the Kingdom. For if Jesus in Matt. x. gives the disciples nothing to take with them on their mission but predictions of
Peering; if at the very beginning of His ministry He closes the Beatitudes with a blessing upon the persecuted; if in Mark viii. 34 ff. He
Warns the people that they will have to choose between life and life,
aetween death and death; if, in short, from the first, He loses no opportunity of preaching about suffering and following Him in His suffer-

Wrede, p. 134 ff.
<P>
<center>350</center>
<P>
ings; that is just as much a matter of dogma as His own sufferings and
predictions of sufferings. For in both cases the necessity of suffering, the
necessity of facing death, is not "a necessity of the historical situation,"
not a necessity which arises out of the circumstances; it is an assertion
put forth without empirical basis, a prophecy of storm while the sky
is blue, since neither Jesus nor the people to whom He spoke were undergoing
any persecution; and when His fate overtook Him not even the
disciples were involved in it. It is distinctly remarkable that, except for
a few meagre references, the enigmatic character of Jesus' constant predictions
of suffering has not been discussed in the Life-of-Jesus literature. [1]
<P>
What has now to be done, therefore, is, in contradistinction to Wrede,
to make a critical examination of the dogmatic element in the life of
Jesus on the assumption that the atmosphere of the time was saturated
with eschatology, that is, to keep in even closer touch with the facts than
Wrede does, and moreover, to proceed, not from the particular to the
general, but from the general to the particular, carefully considering
whether the dogmatic element is not precisely the historical element.
For, after all, why should not Jesus think in terms of doctrine, and make
history in action, just as well as a poor Evangelist can do it on paper,
under the pressure of the theological interests of the primitive community.
<P>
Once again, however, we must repeat that the critical analysis and
the assertion of a system running through the disorder are the same in
the eschatological as in the sceptical hypothesis, only that in the eschatological
analysis a number of problems come more clearly to light. The
two constructions are related like the bones and cartilage of the body.
The general structure is the same, only that in the case of the one a
solid substance, lime, is distributed even in the minutest portions, giving
it firmness and solidity, while in the other case this is lacking. This
reinforcing substance is the eschatological world-view.
<P>
How is it to be explained that Wrede, in spite of the eschatological
school, in spite of Johannes Weiss, could, in critically investigating the
connecting principle of the life of Jesus, simply leave eschatology out
of account? The blame rests with the eschatological school itself, for it
applied the eschatological explanation only to the preaching of Jesus,
and not even to the whole of this, but only to the Messianic secret, instead of using it also to throw light upon the whole public work of
Jesus, the connexion and want of connexion between the events. It repre-
<P>
[1] It is always assumed as self-evident that Jesus is speaking of the sufferings a
persecutions which would take place after His death, or that the Evangelist, in
making Him speak in this way, is thinking of these later persecutions. There is no
hint of that in the text.
<P>
<center>351</center>
<P>
sented Jesus as thinking and speaking eschatologically in some of the
most important passages of His teaching, but for the rest gave as uneschatological a presentation of His life as modern historical theology
had done. The teaching of Jesus and the history of Jesus were set in
different keys. Instead of destroying the modern-historical scheme of
the life of Jesus, or subjecting it to a rigorous examination, and thereby
undertaking the performance of a highly valuable service to criticism,
the eschatological theory confined itself within the limits of New Testament Theology, and left it to Wrede to reveal one after another by a
laborious purely critical method the difficulties which from its point
of view it might have grasped historically at a single glance. It inevitably
follows that Wrede is unjust to Johannes Weiss and Johannes Weiss
towards Wrede. [1]
<P>
It is quite inexplicable that the eschatological school, with its clear
perception of the eschatological element in the preaching of the Kingdom
of God, did not also hit upon the thought of the "dogmatic" element in the history of Jesus. Eschatology is simply "dogmatic history"-history as moulded by theological beliefs-which breaks in upon the
natural course of history and abrogates it. Is it not even a priori the
only conceivable view that the conduct of one who looked forward to
His Messianic "Parousia" in the near future should be determined, not
by the natural course of events, but by that expectation? The chaotic
confusion of the narratives ought to have suggested the thought that
the events had been thrown into this confusion by the volcanic force
of an incalculable personality, not by some kind of carelessness or
freak of the tradition.
<P>
A very little consideration suffices to show that there is something
quite incomprehensible in the public ministry of Jesus taken as a whole.
According to Mark it lasted less than a year, for since he speaks of only
one Passover-journey we may conclude that no other Passover fell
within the period of Jesus' activity as a teacher. If it is proposed to
<P>
[1] That the eschatological school showed a certain timidity in drawing the
consequences of its recognition of the character of the preaching of Jesus and
examining the tradition from the eschatological standpoint can be seen from
Johannes Weiss's work, "The Earliest Gospel" (<i>Das alteste Evangelium</i>), Gottingen,
1903, 414 pp. Ingenious and interesting as this work is in detail, one is surprised to
find the author of the "Preaching of Jesus" here endeavouring to distinguish
between Mark and "Ur-Markus," to point to examples of Pauline influence, to
exhibit clearly the "tendencies" which guided, respectively, the original Evangelist
and the redactor-all this as if he did not possess in his eschatological view of the
preaching of Jesus a dominant conception which gives him a clue to quite a different
psychology from that which he actually applies. Against Wrede he brings forward
many arguments which are worthy of attention, but he can hardly be said to have
refuted him, because it is impossible for Weiss to treat the question in the exact
form in which it was raised by Wrede.
<P>
<center>352</center>
<P>
assume that He allowed a Passover to go by without going up to Jerusalem, His adversaries, who took Him to task about hand-washings
and about rubbing the ears of corn on the Sabbath, would certainly have
made a most serious matter of this, and we should have to suppose that
the Evangelist for some reason or other thought fit to suppress the fact.
That is to say, the burden of proof lies upon those who assert a longer
duration for the ministry of Jesus.
<P>
Until they have succeeded in proving it, we may assume something
like the following course of events. Jesus, in going up to a Passover
came in contact with the movement initiated by John the Baptist in
Judaea, and, after the lapse of a little time-if we bring into the reckoning
the forty days' sojourn in the wilderness mentioned in Mark i. 13,
a few weeks later-appeared in Galilee proclaiming the near approach
of the Kingdom of God. According to Mark He had known Himself since
His baptism to be the Messiah, but from the historical point of view
that does not matter, since history is concerned with the first announcement
of the Messiahship, not with inward psychological processes. [1]
<P>
This work of preaching the Kingdom was continued until the sending
forth of the Twelve; that is to say, at the most for a few weeks. Perhaps
in the saying "the harvest is great but the labourers are few," with which
Jesus closes His work prior to sending forth the disciples, there lies an
allusion to the actual state of the natural fields. The flocking of the
people to Him after the Mission of the Twelve, when a great multitude
thronged about Him for several days during His journey along the
northern shore of the lake, can be more naturally explained if the harvest
had just been brought in.
<P>
However that may be, it is certain that Jesus, in the midst of His
initial success, left Galilee, journeyed northwards, and only resumed
His work as a teacher in Judaea on the way to Jerusalem! Of His "public
ministry," therefore, a large section falls out, being cancelled by a
period of inexplicable concealment; it dwindles to a few weeks of
preaching here and there in Galilee and the few days of His sojourn
in Jerusalem. [2]
<P>
[1] Wrede certainly goes too far in asserting that even in Mark's version the
experience at the baptism is conceived as an open miracle, perceptible to others.
The way in which the revelations to the prophets are recounted in the Old Testament
does not make in favour of this. Otherwise we should have to suppose that the
Evangelist described the incident as a miracle which took place in the presence of
a multitude without perceiving that in this case the Messianic secret was a secret
no longer. If so, the story of the baptism stands on the same footing as the story
of the Messianic entry: it is a revelation of the Messiahship which has absolutely
no results.
<P>
[2] The statement of Mark that Jesus, coming out of the north, appeared for
a moment again in Decapolis and Capernaum, and then started off to the north
once more (Mark vii. 31-viii. 27), may here provisionally be left out of account
since it stands in relation with the twofold account of the feeding of the multitude.
So too the enigmatic appearance and disappearance of the people (Mark viii. 34-ix.
30) may here be passed over. These statements make no difference to the fact that
Jesus really broke off his work in Galilee shortly after the Mission of the Twelve,
since they imply at most a quite transient contact with the people.
<P>
<center>353</center>
<P>
But in that case the public life of Jesus becomes practically unintelligible.
The explanation that His cause in Galilee was lost, and that
He was obliged to flee, has not the slightest foundation in the text. [1] That
was recognised even by Keim, the inventor of the successful and unsucessful
periods in the life of Jesus, as is shown by his suggestion that the
Evangelists had intentionally removed the traces of failure from the
decisive period which led up to the northern journey. The controversy
over the washing of hands in Mark vii. 1-23, to which appeal is always
made, is really a defeat for the Pharisees. The theory of the "desertion
of the Galilaeans," which appears with more or less artistic variations
in all modern Lives of Jesus, owes its existence not to any other confirmatory fact, but simply to the circumstance that Mark makes the
simple statement: "And Jesus departed and went into the region of
Tyre" (vii. 24) without offering any explanation of this decision.
<P>
The only conclusion which the text warrants is that Mark mentioned
no reason because he knew of none. The decision of Jesus did not rest
upon the recorded facts, since it ignores these, but upon considerations
lying outside the history. His life at this period was dominated by a
"dogmatic idea" which rendered Him indifferent to all else . . . even
to the happy and successful work as a teacher which was opening before
Him. How could Jesus the "teacher" abandon at that moment a people
so anxious to learn and so eager for salvation? His action suggests a
doubt-whether He really felt Himself to be a "teacher." If all the controversial
discourses and sayings and answers to questions, which were
so to speak wrung from Him, were subtracted from the sum of His
utterances, how much of the didactic preaching of Jesus would be left
over?
<P>
But even the supposed didactic preaching is not really that of a
"teacher," since the purpose of His parables was, according to Mark
iv. 10-12, not to reveal, but to conceal, and of the Kingdom of God He
spoke only in parables (Mark iv. 34).
<P>
Perhaps, however, we are not justified in extending the theory of concealment, simply because it is mentioned in connexion with the first
parable, to all the parables which He ever spoke, for it is never men-
<P>
[1] On the theory of the successful and unsuccessful periods in the work of Jesus
see the "Sketch," p. 3 ff., "The four Pre-suppositions of the Modern Historical
Solution."
<P>
<center>354</center>
<P>
tioned again. It could hardly indeed be applied to the parables with a
moral, like that, for instance, of the pearl of great price. It is equally
inapplicable to the parables of coming judgment uttered at Jerusalem
in which He explicitly exhorts the people to be prepared and watchful
in view of the coming of judgment and of the Kingdom. But here too it
is deserving of notice that Jesus, whenever He desires to make known
anything further concerning the Kingdom of God than just its near approach,
seems to be confined, as it were by a higher law, to the parabolic
form of discourse. It is as though, for reasons which we cannot
grasp, His teaching lay under certain limitations. It appears as a kind
of accessory aspect of His vocation. Thus it was possible for Him to
give up His work as a teacher even at the moment when it promised the
greatest success.
<P>
Accordingly the fact of His always speaking in parables and of His
taking this inexplicable resolution both point back to a mysterious presupposition
which greatly reduces the importance of Jesus' work as a
teacher.
<P>
One reason for this limitation is distinctly stated in Mark iv. 10-12,
viz. predestination! Jesus knows that the truth which He offers is exclusively
for those who have been definitely chosen, that the general
and public announcement of His message could only thwart the plans
of God, since the chosen are already winning their salvation from God.
Only the phrase, "Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand" and its
variants belong to the public preaching. And this, therefore, is the only
message which He commits to His disciples when sending them forth.
What this repentance, supplementary to the law, the special ethic of the
interval before the coming of the Kingdom (<i>Interimesethik</i>) is, in its
positive acceptation, He explains in the Sermon on the Mount. But all
that goes beyond that simple phrase must be publicly presented only in
parables, in order that those only, who are shown to possess predestination
by having the initial knowledge which enables them to understand
the parables, may receive a more advanced knowledge, which is imparted
to them in a measure corresponding to their original degree ot
knowledge: "Unto him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath
not shall be taken away even that which he hath" (Mark iv. 24-25).
<P>
The predestinarian view goes along with the eschatology. It is pushed
to its utmost consequences in the closing incident of the parable of the
marriage of the King's son (Matt. xxii. 1-14) where the man who, in
response to a publicly issued invitation, sits down at the table of the
King, but is recognised from his appearance as not called, is thrown
out into perdition. "Many are called but few are chosen."
<P>
The ethical idea of salvation and the predestinarian limitation of acceptance to the elect are constantly in conflict in the mind of Jesus. In
<P>
<center>355</center>
<P>
one case, however. He finds relief in the thought of predestination.
When the rich young man turned away, not having strength to give up
his possessions for the sake of following Jesus as he had been commanded
to do, Jesus and His disciples were forced to draw the conclusion
that he, like other rich men, was lost, and could not enter into the Kingdom
of God. But immediately afterwards Jesus makes the suggestion,
"With men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things
are possible" (Mark x. 17-27). That is, He will not give up the hope
that the young man, in spite of appearances, which are against him,
will be found to have belonged to the Kingdom of God, solely in virtue
of the secret all-powerful will of God. Of a "conversion" of the young
man there is no question.
<P>
In the Beatitudes, on the other hand, the argument is reversed; the
predestination is inferred from its outward manifestation. It may seem to
us inconceivable, but they are really predestinarian in form. Blessed are
the poor in spirit! Blessed are the meek! Blessed are the peacemakers!-that
does not mean that by virtue of their being poor in spirit, meek,
peace-loving, they deserve the Kingdom. Jesus does not intend the saying
as an injunction or exhortation, but as a simple statement of fact: in
their being poor in spirit, in their meekness, in their love of peace, it is
made manifest that they are predestined to the Kingdom. By the possession
of these qualities they are marked as belonging to it. In the case
of others (Matt. v. 10-12) the predestination to the Kingdom is made
manifest by the persecutions which befall them in this world. These are
the light of the world, which already shines among men for the glory
of God (Matt. v. 14-15).
<P>
The kingdom cannot be "earned"; what happens is that men are
called to it, and show themselves to be called to it. On careful examination
it appears that the idea of reward in the sayings of Jesus is not
really an idea of reward, because it is relieved against a background of
predestination. For the present it is sufficient to note the fact that the
eschatologico-predestinarian view brings a mysterious element of dogma
not merely into the teaching, but also into the public ministry of Jesus.
<P>
To take another point, what is the mystery of the Kingdom of God?
It must consist of something more than merely its near approach, and
something of extreme importance; otherwise Jesus would be here indulging
in mere mystery-mongering. The saying about the candle which
he puts upon the stand, in order that what was hidden may be revealed
to those who have ears to hear, implies that He is making a tremendous
revelation to those who understand the parables about the growth of the
seed. The mystery must therefore contain the explanation why the Kingdom
must now come, and how men are to know how near it is. For the
general fact that it is very near had already been openly proclaimed
<P>
<center>356</center>
<P>
both by the Baptist and by Jesus. The mystery, therefore, must consist
of something more than that.
<P>
In these parables it is not the idea of development, but of the apparent
absence of causation which occupies the foremost place. The
description aims at suggesting the question, how, and by what power
incomparably great and glorious results can be infallibly produced by an
insignificant fact without human aid. A man sowed seed. Much of it
was lost, but the little that fell into good ground brought forth a harvest-thirty,
sixty, an hundredfold-which left no trace of the loss in the
sowing. How did that come about?
<P>
A man sows seed and does not trouble any further about it-cannot
indeed do anything to help it, but he knows that after a definite time
the glorious harvest which arises out of the seed will stand before him.
By what power is that effected?
<P>
An extremely minute grain of mustard seed is planted in the earth
and there necessarily arises out of it a great bush, which cannot certainly
have been contained in the grain of seed. How was that?
<P>
What the parables emphasise is, therefore, so to speak, the in itself
negative, inadequate, character of the initial fact, upon which, as by a
miracle, there follows in the appointed time, through the power of God,
some great thing. They lay stress not upon the natural, but upon the
miraculous character of such occurrences.
<P>
But what is the initial fact of the parables? It is the sowing.
<P>
It is not said that by the man who sows the seed Jesus means Himself.
The man has no importance. In the parable of the mustard seed
he is not even mentioned. All that is asserted is that the initial fact is
already present, as certainly present as the time of the sowing is past
at the moment when Jesus speaks. That being so, the Kingdom of God
must follow as certainly as harvest follows seed-sowing. As a man believes
in the harvest, without being able to explain it, simply because
the seed has been sown; so with the same absolute confidence he may believe in the Kingdom of God.
<P>
And the initial fact which is symbolised? Jesus can only mean a fact
which was actually in existence-the movement of repentance evoked
by the Baptist and now intensified by His own preaching. That necessarily
involves the bringing in of the Kingdom by the power of God;
as man's sowing necessitates the giving of the harvest by the same
Infinite Power. Any one who knows this sees with different eyes the corn
growing in the fields and the harvest ripening, for he sees the one fact
in the other, and awaits along with the earthly harvest the heavenly,
the revelation of the Kingdom of God.
<P>
If we look into the thought more closely we see that the coming of
the Kingdom of God is not only symbolically or analogically/but also
<P>
<center>357</center>
<P>
really and temporally connected with the harvest. The harvest ripening
upon earth is the last! With it comes also the Kingdom of God which
brings in the new age. When the reapers are sent into the fields, the
Lord in Heaven will cause His harvest to be reaped by the holy angels.
<P>
If the three parables of Mark iv. contain the mystery of the Kingdom
of God, and are therefore capable of being summed up in a single formula this can be nothing else than the joyful exhortation: "Ye who have
eyes to see, read, in the harvest which is ripening upon earth, what is
being prepared in heaven!" The eager eschatological hope was to regard the natural process as the last of its kind, and to see in it a special
significance in view of the event of which it was to give the signal.
<P>
The analogical and temporal parallelism becomes complete if we
assume that the movement initiated by the Baptist began in the spring,
and notice that Jesus, according to Matt. ix. 37 and 38, before sending
out the disciples to make a speedy proclamation of the nearness of the
Kingdom of God, uttered the remarkable saying about the rich harvest.
It seems like a final expression of the thought contained in the parables
about the seed and its promise, and finds its most natural explanation in
the supposition that the harvest was actually at hand.
<P>
Whatever may be thought of this attempt to divine historically the
secret of the Kingdom of God, there is one thing that cannot be got away
from, viz. that the initial fact to which Jesus points, under the figure
of the sowing, is somehow or other connected with the eschatological
preaching of repentance, which had been begun by the Baptist.
<P>
That may be the more confidently asserted because Jesus in another
mysterious saying describes the days of the Baptist as a time which
makes preparation for the coming of the Kingdom of God. "From the
days of John the Baptist," He says in Matt. xi. 12, "even until now, the
Kingdom of Heaven is subjected to violence, and the violent wrest it
to themselves." The saying has nothing to do with the entering of individuals into the Kingdom; it simply asserts, that since the coming of
the Baptist a certain number of persons are engaged in forcing on and
compelling the coming of the Kingdom. Jesus' expectation of the Kingdom is an expectation based upon a fact which exercises an active influence upon the Kingdom of God. It was not He, and not the Baptist
who "were working at the coming of the Kingdom"; it is the host of
penitents which is wringing it from God, so that it may now come at
any moment.
<P>
The eschatological insight of Johannes Weiss made an end of the
modern view that Jesus founded the Kingdom. It did away with all
activity, as exercised upon the Kingdom of God, and made the part of
Jesus purely a waiting one. Now the activity comes back into the preaching of the Kingdom, but this time eschatologically conditioned. The
<P>
<center>358</center>
<P>
secret of the Kingdom of God which Jesus unveils in the parables about
confident expectation in Mark iv., and declares in so many words in the
eulogy on the Baptist (Matt. xi.), amounts to this, that in the movement
to which the Baptist gave the first impulse, and which still continued,
there was an initial fact which was drawing after it the coming of the
Kingdom, in a fashion which was miraculous, unintelligible, but unfailingly
certain, since the sufficient cause for it lay in the power and
purpose of God.
<P>
It should be observed that Jesus in these parables, as well as in the
related saying at the sending forth of the Twelve, uses the formula, "He
that hath ears to hear, let him hear" (Mark iv. 23 and Matt. xi. 15)
thereby signifying that in this utterance there lies concealed a supernatural
knowledge concerning the plans of God, which only those who
have ears to hear-that is, the foreordained-can detect. For others
these sayings are unintelligible.
<P>
If this genuinely "historical" interpretation of the mystery of the
Kingdom of God is correct, Jesus must have expected the coming of
the Kingdom at harvest time. And that is just what He did expect. It
is for that reason that He sends out His disciples to make known in
Israel, as speedily as may be, what is about to happen. That in this He
is actuated by a dogmatic idea, becomes clear when we notice that, according
to Mark, the mission of the Twelve followed immediately on the
rejection at Nazareth. The unreceptiveness of the Nazarenes had made
no impression upon Him; He was only astonished at their unbelief
(Mark vi. 6). This passage is often interpreted to mean that He was
astonished to find His miracle-working power fail Him. There is no
hint of that in the text. What He is astonished at is, that in His native
town there were so few believers, that is, elect, knowing as He does
that the Kingdom of God may appear at any moment. But that fact
makes no difference whatever to the nearness of the coming of the
Kingdom.
<P>
The Evangelist, therefore, places the rejection at Nazareth and the
mission of the Twelve side by side, simply because he found them in this
temporal connexion in the tradition. If he had been working by "association
of ideas," he would not have arrived at this order. The want of connexion,
the impossibility of applying any natural explanation, is just
what is historical, because the course of the history was determined, not
by outward events, but by the decisions of Jesus, and these were determined
by dogmatic, eschatoiogical considerations.
<P>
To how great an extent this was the case in regard to the mission of
the Twelve is clearly seen from the "charge" which Jesus gave them.
He tells them in plain words (Matt. x. 23), that He does not expect
to see them back in the present age. The Parousia of the Son of Man,
<P>
<center>359</center>
<P>
which is logically and temporally identical with the dawn of the Kingdom
will take place before they shall have completed a hasty journey
through the cities of Israel to announce it. That the words mean this
and nothing else, that they ought not to be in any way weakened down,
should be sufficiently evident. This is the form in which Jesus reveals
to them the secret of the Kingdom of God. A few days later, He utters
the saying about the violent who, since the days of John the Baptist, are
forcing on the coming of the Kingdom.
<P>
It is equally clear, and here the dogmatic considerations which guided
the resolutions of Jesus become still more prominent, that this prediction
was not fulfilled. The disciples returned to Him; and the appearing
of the Son of Man had not taken place. The actual history disavowed the
dogmatic history on which the action of Jesus had been based. An event
of supernatural history which must take place, and must take place at
that particular point of time, failed to come about. That was for Jesus,
who lived wholly in the dogmatic history, the first "historical" occurrence,
the central event which closed the former period of His activity
and gave the coming period a new character. To this extent modern
theology is justified when it distinguishes two periods in the Life of
Jesus; an earlier, in which He is surrounded by the people, a later in
which He is "deserted" by them, and travels about with the Twelve only.
It is a sound observation that the two periods are sharply distinguished
by the attitude of Jesus. To explain this difference of attitude, which
they thought themselves bound to account for on natural historical
grounds, theologians of the modern historical school invented the theory
of growing opposition and waning support. Weisse, no doubt, had expressed
himself in direct opposition to this theory. [1] Keim, who gave
it its place in theology, was aware that in setting it up he was going
against the plain sense of the texts. Later writers lost this consciousness,
just as in the first and third Gospel the significance of the Messianic
secret in Mark gradually faded away; they imagined that they could
find the basis of fact for the theory in the texts, and did not realise that
they only believed in the desertion of the multitude and the "flights and
retirements" of Jesus because they could not otherwise explain historically the alteration in His conduct, His withdrawal from public
work, and His resolve to die.
<P>
The thoroughgoing eschatoiogical school makes better work of it.
<P>
[1] Weisse found that there was no hint in the sources of the desertion of the people,
since according to these, Jesus was opposed only by the Pharisees, not by the people.
The abandonment of the Galilaean work, and the departure to Jerusalem, must, he
thought, have been due to some unrecorded fact which revealed to Jesus that the
time had come to act in this way. Perhaps, he adds, it was the waning of Jesus'
miracle-working power which caused the change in His attitude, since it is remarkable
that He performed no further miracles during His sojourn at Jerusalem.
<P>
<center>360</center>
<P>
They recognise in the non-occurrence of the Parousia promised in Matt
x. 23, the "historic fact," in the estimation of Jesus, which in some way
determined the alteration in His plans, and His attitude towards the
multitude.
<P>
The whole history of "Christianity" down to the present day, that
is to say, the real inner history of it, is based on the delay of the
Parousia, the non-occurrence of the Parousia, the abandonment of
eschatology, the progress and completion of the "de-eschatologising"
of religion which has been connected therewith. It should be noted that
the non-fulfilment of Matt. x. 23 is the first postponement of the Parousia.
We have therefore here the first significant date in the "history of Christianity"; it gives to the work of Jesus a new direction, otherwise in explicable.
<P>
Here we recognise also why the Marcan hypothesis, in constructing
its view of the Life of Jesus, found itself obliged to have recourse more
and more to the help of modern psychology, and thus necessarily became more and more unhistorical. The fact which alone makes possible
an understanding of the whole, is lacking in this Gospel. Without Matt.
x. and xi. everything remains enigmatic. For this reason Bruno Bauer
and Wrede are in their own way the only consistent representatives of
the Marcan hypothesis from the point of view of historical criticism,
when they arrive at the result that the Marcan account is inherently unintelligible. Keim, with his strong sense of historical reality, rightly felt
that the plan of the Life of Jesus should not be constructed exclusively
on the basis of Mark.
<P>
The recognition that Mark alone gives an inadequate basis, is more
important than any "Ur-Markus" theories, for which it is impossible to
discover a literary foundation, or find an historical use. A simple induction from the "facts" takes us beyond Mark. In the discourse-material
of Matthew, which the modern-historical school thought they could sift
in here and there, wherever there seemed to be room for it, there lie
hidden certain facts-facts which never happened, but are all the more
important for that.                                                -
<P>
Why Mark describes the events and discourses in the neighbourhood
of the mission of the Twelve with such careful authentication is a
literary question which the historical study of the life of Jesus may
leave open; the more so since, even as a literary question, it is insoluble.
<P>
The prediction of the Parousia of the Son of Man is not the only one
which remained unfulfilled. There is the prediction of sufferings which
is connected with it. To put it more acurately, the prediction of the
appearing of the Son of Man in Matt. x. 23 runs up into a prediction of
sufferings, which, working up to a climax, forms the remainder of the
<P>
<center>361</center>
<P>
discourse at the sending forth of the disciples. This prediction of sufferings
has as little to do with objective history as the prediction of
the Parousia. Consequently, none of the Lives of Jesus, which follow
the lines of a natural psychology, from Weisse down to Oskar Holtzmann,
can make anything of it. [1] They either strike it out, or transfer it
to the last "gloomy epoch" of the life of Jesus, regard it as an unintelligible
anticipation, or put it down to the account of "primitive theology,"
which serves as a scrap-heap for everything for which they
cannot find a place in the "historical life of Jesus."
<P>
In the texts it is quite evident that Jesus is not speaking of sufferings
after His death, but of sufferings which will befall them as soon as they
have gone forth from Him. The death of Jesus is not here pre-supposed,
but only the Parousia of the Son of Man, and it is implied that this will
occur just after these sufferings and bring them to a close. If the theology
of the primitive Church had remoulded the tradition, as is always
being asserted, it would have made Jesus give His followers directions
for their conduct after His death. That we do not find anything of this
kind is the best proof that there can be no question of a remoulding
of the Life of Jesus by primitive theology. How easy it would have been
for the Early Church to scatter here and there through the discourses
of Jesus directions which were only to be applied after His death! But
the simple fact is that it did not do so.
<P>
The sufferings of which the prospect is held out at the sending forth
are doubly, trebly, nay four times over, unhistorical. In the first place-and this is the only point which modern historical theology has noticed-because there is not a shadow of a suggestion in the outward cir-
cumstances of anything which could form a natural occasion for such
predictions of, and exhortations relating to, sufferings. In the second
place-and this has been overlooked by modern theology because it
had already declared them to be unhistorical in its own characteristic
fashion, viz, by striking them out-because they were not fulfilled. In
the third place-and this has not entered into the mind of modern theology at all-because these sayings were spoken in the closest connexion
with the promise of the Parousia and are placed in the closest connexion
with that event. In the fourth place, because the description of that
which is to befall the disciples is quite without any basis in experience,
A time of general dissension will begin, in which brothers will rise up
sgainst brothers, and fathers against sons and children against their
Parents to cause them to be put to death (Matt. x. 21). And the disciples
Mall be hated of all men for His name's sake." Let them strive to hold
<P>
[1] The most logical attitude in regard to it is Bousset's, who proposes to treat
the mission and everything connected with it as a "confused and unintelligible"
tradition.
<P>
<center>362</center>
<P>
out to the "end," that is, to the coming of the Son of Man, in order that
they may be saved (Matt. x. 22).
<P>
But why should they suddenly be hated and persecuted for the name
of Jesus, seeing that this name played no part whatever in their preaching?
That is simply inconceivable. The relation of Jesus to the Son
of Man, the fact, that is to say, that it is He who is to be manifested
as Son of Man, must therefore in some way or other become known in
the interval; not, however, through the disciples, but by some other
means of revelation. A kind of supernatural illumination will suddenly
make known all that Jesus has been keeping secret regarding the Kingdom
of God and His position in the Kingdom. This illumination will
arise as suddenly and without preparation as the spirit of strife.
<P>
And as a matter of fact Jesus predicts to the disciples in the same
discourse that to their own surprise a supernatural wisdom will suddenly
speak from their lips, so that it will be not they but the Spirit of
God who will answer the great ones of the earth. As the Spirit is for
Jesus and early Christian theology something concrete which is to descend
upon the elect among mankind only in consequence of a definite
event-the outpouring of the Spirit which, according to the prophecy of
Joel, should precede the day of judgment-Jesus must have anticipated
that this would occur during the absence of the disciples, in the midst
of the time of strife and confusion.
<P>
To put it differently; the whole of the discourse at the sending forth
of the Twelve, taken in the clear sense of the words, is a prediction of
the events of the "time of the end," events which are immediately at
hand, in which the supernatural eschatological course of history will
break through into the natural course. The expectation of sufferings is
therefore doctrinal and unhistorical, as is, precisely in the same way,
the expectation of the pouring forth of the Spirit uttered at the same
time. The Parousia of the Son of Man is to be preceded according to
the Messianic dogma by a time of strife and confusion-as it were, the
birth-throes of the Messiah-and the outpouring of the Spirit. It should
be noticed that according to Joel ii. and iii. the outpouring of the Spirit,
along with the miraculous signs, forms the prelude to the judgment; and
also, that in the same context, Joel iii. 13, the judgment is described as
the harvest-day of God. [1] Here we have a remarkable parallel to the
<P>
[1] Joel iii. 13, "Put in the sickle for the harvest is ripe!" In the Apocalypse of
John, too, the Last Judgment is described as the heavenly harvest: "Thrust in thy
sickle and reap; for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth
is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth
was reaped" (Rev. xiv. 15 and 16).
<P>
The most remarkable parallel to the discourse at the sending forth of the disciples
is offered by the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch: "Behold, the days come, when the
time of the world shall be ripe, and the harvest of the sowing of the good and of the
evil shall come, when the Almighty shall bring upon the earth and upon its inhabitants and upon their rulers confusion of spirit and terror that makes the heart
stand still; and they shall hate one another and provoke one another to war; and
the despised shall have power over them of reputation, and the mean shall exalt
themselves over them that are highly esteemed. And the many shall be at the mercy
of the few . . . and all who shall be saved and shall escape the before-mentioned
(dangers) . . . shall be given into the hands of my servant, the Messiah. (Cap.
lxx. 2, 3, 9. Following the translation of E. Kautzsch.)
<P>
The connexion between the ideas of harvest and of judgment was therefore one of
the stock features of the apocalyptic writings. And as the Apocalypse of Baruch
dates from the period about A.D. 70, it may be assumed that this association of ideas
was also current in the Jewish apocalyptic of the time of Jesus. Here is a basis for
understanding the secret of the Kingdom of God in the parables of sowing and
reaping historically and in accordance with the ideas of the time. What Jesus did
was to make known to those who understood Him that the coming earthly harvest
was the last, and was also the token of the coming heavenly harvest. The eschatological
interpretation is immensely strengthened by these parallels.
<P>
<center>363</center>
<P>
saying about the harvest in Matt. ix. 38, which forms the introduction
to the discourse at the sending forth of the disciples.
<P>
There is only one point in which the predicted course of eschatological
events is incomplete: the appearance of Elias is not mentioned.
<P>
Jesus could not prophesy to the disciples the Parousia of the Son of
Man without pointing them, at the same time, to the pre-eschatological
events which must first occur. He must open to them a part of the secret
of the Kingdom of God, viz. the nearness of the harvest, that they might
not be taken by surprise and caused to doubt by these events.
<P>
Thus this discourse is historical as a whole and down to the smallest
detail precisely because, according to the view of modern theology, it
must be judged unhistorical. It is, in fact, full of eschatological dogma.
Jesus had no need to instruct the disciples as to what they were to teach;
for they had only to utter a cry. But concerning the events which should
supervene, it was necessary that He should give them information.
Therefore the discourse does not consist of instruction, but of predictions of sufferings and of the Parousia.
<P>
That being so, we may judge with what right the modern psychological
theology dismisses the great Matthaean discourses off-hand as mere
"composite structures." Just let any one try to show how the Evangelist
when he was racking his brains over the task of making a "discourse at
the sending forth of the disciples," half by the method of piecing it together
out of traditional sayings and "primitive theology," and half by
inventing it, lighted on the curious idea of making Jesus speak entirely
of inopportune and unpractical matters; and of then going on to provide
the evidence that they never happened.
<P>
The foretelling of the sufferings that belong to the eschatological distress
is part and parcel of the preaching of the approach of the King-
<P>
<center>364</center>
<P>
dom of God, it embodies the secret of the Kingdom. It is for that reason
that the thought of suffering appears at the end of the Beatitudes and
in the closing petition of the Lord's Prayer. For the <font face="Symbol">peirasmoV</font> which is
there in view is not an individual psychological temptation, but the general
eschatological time of tribulation, from which God is besought to
exempt those who pray so earnestly for the coming of the Kingdom and
not to expose them to that tribulation by way of putting them to the
test.
<P>
There followed neither the sufferings, nor the outpouring of the
Spirit, nor the Parousia of the Son of Man. The disciples returned safe
and sound and full of a proud satisfaction; for one promise had been
realised-the power which had been given them over the demons.
<P>
But from the moment when they rejoined Him, all His thoughts and
efforts were devoted to getting rid of the people in order to be alone
with them (Mark vi. 30-33). Previously, during their absence. He had,
almost in open speech, taught the multitude concerning the Baptist
concerning that which was to precede the coming of the Kingdom, and
concerning the judgment which should come upon the impenitent, even
upon whole towns of them (Matt. xi. 20-24), because, in spite of the
miracles which they had witnessed, they had not recognised the day of
grace and diligently used it for repentance. At the same time He had
rejoiced before them over all those whom God had enlightened that
they might see what was going forward; and had called them to His side
(Matt. xi. 25-30).
<P>
And now suddenly, the moment the disciples return, His one thought
is to get away from the people. They, however, follow Him and overtake
Him on the shores of the lake. He puts the Jordan between Himself
and them by crossing to Bethsaida. They also come to Bethsaida. He returns
to Capernaum. They do the same. Since in Galilee it is impossible
for Him to be alone, and He absolutely must be alone, He "slips away"
to the north. Once more modern theology was right: He really does
flee; not, however, from hostile Scribes, but from the people, who dog
His footsteps in order to await in His company the appearing of the
Kingdom of God and of the Son of Man-to await it in vain. [1]
<P>
In Strauss's first Life of Jesus the question is thrown out whether,
<P>
[1] With what right does modern critical theology tear apart even the discourse in
Matt. xi. in order to make the "cry of jubilation" into the cry with which Jesus
saluted the return of His disciples, and to find lodgment for the woes upon Chorazin
and Bethsaida somewhere else in an appropriately gloomy context? Is not all this
apparently disconnected material held together by an inner bond of connexion-the
secret of the Kingdom of God which is imminently impending over Jesus and the
people? Or, is Jesus expected to preach like one who has a thesis to maintain and
seeks about for the most logical arrangement? Does not a certain lack of orderly
connexion belong to the very idea of prophetic speech?
<P>
<center>365</center>
<P>
in view of Matt. x. 23, Jesus did not think of His Parousia as a transformation
which should take place during His lifetime. Ghillany bases
his work on this possibility as on an established historical fact. Dalman
takes this hypothesis to be the necessary correlative of the interpretation
of the self-designation Son of Man on the basis of Daniel and the
Apocalypses.
<P>
If Jesus, he argues, designated Himself in this futuristic sense as the
Son of Man who comes from Heaven, He must have assumed that He
would first be transported thither. "A man who had died or been rapt
away from the earth might perhaps be brought into the world again in
this way, or one who had never been on earth might so descend thither."
But as this conception of transformation and removal seems to Dalman
untenable in the case of Jesus, he treats it as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of
the eschatological interpretation of the title.
<P>
But why? If Jesus as a man walking in a natural body upon earth,
predicts to His disciples the Parousia of the Son of Man in the immediate future, with the secret conviction that He Himself was to be revealed
as the Son of Man, He must have made precisely this assumption that
He would first be supernaturally removed and transformed. He thought
of Himself as any one must who believes in the immediate coming of
the last things, as living in two different conditions: the present, and the
future condition into which He is to be transferred at the coming of
the new supernatural world. We learn later that the disciples on the way
up to Jerusalem were entirely possessed by the thought of what they
should be when this transformation took place. They contend as to who
shall have the highest position (Mark ix. 33); James and John wish
Jesus to promise them in advance the thrones on His right hand and on
His left (Mark x. 35-37).
<P>
He, moreover, does not rebuke them for indulging such thoughts, but
only tells them how much, in the present age, of service, humiliation, and
suffering is necessary to constitute a claim to such places in the future
age, and that it does not in the last resort belong to Him to allot the
places on His left and on His right, but that they shall be given to those
for whom they are prepared; therefore, perhaps not to any of the disciples
(Mark x. 40). At this point, therefore, the knowledge and will of
Jesus are thwarted and limited by the predestinarianism which is bound
up with eschatology.
<P>
It is quite mistaken, however, to speak as modern theology does, of
the "service" here required as belonging to the "new ethic of the Kingdom
of God." There is for Jesus no ethic of the Kingdom of God, for in
the Kingdom of God all natural relationships, even, for example, the
distinction of sex (Mark xii. 25 and 26), are abolished. Temptation
and sin no longer exist. All is "reign," a "reign" which has gradations
<P>
<center>366</center>
<P>
-Jesus speaks of the "least in the Kingdom of God"-according as it
has been determined in each individual case from all eternity, and according as each by his self-humiliation and refusal to rule in the present
age has proved his fitness for bearing rule in the future Kingdom.
<P>
For the loftier stations, however, it is necesasry to have proved oneself in persecution and suffering. Accordingly, Jesus asks the sons of
Zebedee whether, since they claim these thrones on His right hand and
on His left, they feel themselves strong enough to drink of His cup and
be baptized with His baptism (Mark x. 38). To serve, to humble oneself, to incur persecution and death, belong to "the ethic of the interim"
just as much as does penitence. They are indeed only a higher form of
penitence.
<P>
A vivid eschatological expectation is therefore impossible to conceive apart from the idea of a metamorphosis. The resurrection is only
a special case of this metamorphosis, the form in which the new condition of things is realised in the case of those who are already dead.
The resurrection, the metamorphosis, and the Parousia of the Son of
Man take place simultaneously, and are one and the same act. [1] It is therefore quite indifferent whether a man loses his life shortly before the
Parousia in order to "find his life," if that is what is ordained for him;
that signifies only that he will undergo the eschatological metamorphosis
with the dead instead of with the living.
<P>
The Pauline eschatology recognises both conceptions side by side,
in such a way, however, that the resurrection is subordinated to the
metamorphosis. "Behold, I shew you a mystery," he says in 1 Cor. xv.
51 ff.; "we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. In a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound,
and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
<P>
The apostle himself desires to be one of those who live to experience
the metamorphosis and to be clothed with the heavenly mode of existence (2 Cor. v. 1 ft.). The metamorphosis, however, and the resurrection are, for those who are "in Christ," connected with a being caught
up into the clouds of heaven (1 Thess. iv. 15 ft.). Therefore Paul also
makes one and the same event of the metamorphosis, resurrection, and
translation.
<P>
In seeking clues to the eschatology of Jesus, scholars have passed over
the eschatology which lies closest to it, that of Paul. But why? Is it not
<P>
[1] If, therefore, Jesus at a later point predicted to His disciples His resurrection,
He means by that, not a single isolated act, but a complex occurrence consisting
of His metamorphosis, translation to heaven, and Parousia as the Son of Man. And
with this is associated the general eschatological resurrection of the dead. It is,
therefore, one and the same thing whether He speaks of His resurrection or of His
coming on the clouds of heaven.
<P>
<center>367</center>
<P>
identical with that of Jesus, at least in so far that both are "Jewish
eschatology"? Did not Reimarus long ago declare that the eschatology
of the primitive Christian community was identical with the Jewish, and
only went beyond it in claiming a definite knowledge on a single point
which was unessential to the nature and course of the expected events,
in knowing, that is, who the Son of Man should be? That Christians
drew no distinction between their own eschatology and the Jewish is
evident from the whole character of the earlier apocalyptic literature,
and not least from the Apocalypse of John! After all, what alteration
did the belief that Jesus was the Son of Man who was to be revealed
make in the general scheme of the course of apocalyptic events?
<P>
From the Rabbinic literature little help is to be derived towards the
understanding of the world of thought in which Jesus lived, and His
view of His own Person. The latest researches may be said to have made
that clear. A few moral maxims, a few halting parables-that is all
that can be produced in the way of parallels. Even the conception which
is there suggested of the hidden coming and work of the Messiah is of
little importance. We find the same ideas in the mouth of Trypho in
Justin's dialogue, and that makes their Jewish character doubtful. That
Jesus of Nazareth knew Himself to be the Son of Man who was to be
revealed is for us the great fact of His self-consciousness, which is not
to be further explained, whether there had been any kind of preparation
for it in contemporary theology or not.
<P>
The self-consciousness of Jesus cannot in fact be illustrated or explained;
all that can be explained is the eschatological view, in which
the Man who possessed that self-consciousness saw reflected in advance
the coming events, both those of a more general character, and those
which especially related to Himself. [1]
<P>
The eschatology of Jesus can therefore only be interpreted by the aid
of the curiously intermittent Jewish apocalyptic literature of the period
between Daniel and the Bar-Cochba rising. What else, indeed, are the
Synoptic Gospels, the Pauline letters, the Christian apocalypses than
products of Jewish apocalyptic, belonging, moreover, to its greatest and
most nourishing period? Historically regarded, the Baptist, Jesus, and
Paul are simply the culminating manifestations of Jewish apocalyptic
thought. The usual representation is the exact converse of the truth.
Writers describe Jewish eschatology in order to illustrate the ideas of
Jesus. But what is this "Jewish eschatology" after all? It is an escha-
<P>
[1] The title of Baldensperger's book, <i>The Self-consciousness of Jesus in the Light
of the Messianic Hopes of His Time</i>, really contains a promise which is impossible
of fulfilment. The contemporary "Messianic hopes" can only explain the hopes of
Jesus so far as they corresponded thereto, not His view of His own Person, in
which He is absolutely original.
<P>
<center>368</center>
<P>
tology with a great gap in it, because the culminating period, with the
documents which relate to it, has been left out. The true historian will
describe the eschatology of the Baptist, of Jesus, and of Paul in order
to explain Jewish eschatology. It is nothing less than a misfortune for
the science of New Testament Theology that no real attempt has hitherto
been made to write the history of Jewish eschatology as it really was-that is, with the inclusion of the Baptist, of Jesus, and of Paul. [1]
<P>
All this has had to be said in order to justify the apparently self-evident assertion that Mark, Matthew, and Paul are the best sources for
the Jewish eschatology of the time of Jesus. They represent a phase
which even in detail is self-explanatory, of that Jewish apocalyptic hope
which manifested itself from time to time. We are, therefore, justified
in first reconstructing the Jewish apocalyptic of the time independently
out of these documents, that is to say, in bringing the details of the discourses of Jesus into an eschatological system, and then on the basis of
this system endeavouring to explain the apparently disconnected events
in the history of His public life.
<P>
The lines of connection which run backwards towards the Psalms
of Solomon, Enoch, and Daniel, and forwards towards the apocalypses
of Baruch and Enoch, are extremely important for the understanding
of certain general conceptions. On the other hand, it is impossible to
over-emphasise the uniqueness of the point of view from which the
eschatology of the time of the Baptist, of Jesus, and of Paul presents
itself to us.
<P>
In the first place, men feel themselves so close to the coming events
that they only see what lies nearest to them, the imaginative development of detail entirely ceases. In the second place, it appears to us as
though seen, so to speak, from within, passed through the medium of
powerful minds like those of the Baptist and Jesus. That is why it is
so great and simple. On the other hand, a certain complication arises
from the fact that it now intersects actual history. All these are original
features of it, which are not found in the Jewish apocalyptic writings of
the preceding and following periods, and that is why these documents
give us so little help in regard to the characteristic detail of the eschatology of Jesus and His contemporaries.
<P>
A further point to be noticed is that the eschatology of the time of
Jesus shows the influence of the eschatology of the ancient prophets in
a way which is not paralleled either before or after. Compare the
<P>
[1] Even Baldensperger's book. <i>Die messianisch-apokalyptischen Hoffnungen des
Judentums</i> (1903), passes at a stride from the Psalms of Solomon to Fourth Ezra.
The coming volume is to deal with the eschatology of Jesus. That is a "theological,"
but not an historical division of the material. The second volume should properly
come in the middle of the first.
<P>
<center>369</center>
<P>
Synoptic eschatology with that of the Psalms of Solomon. In place of
the legal righteousness, which, since the return from the exile, had
formed the link of connexion between the present and the future, we
find the prophetic ethic, the demand for a general repentance, even in
the case of the Baptist. In the Apocalypses of Baruch and Ezra we see,
especially in the theological character of the latter, the persistent traces
of this ethical deepening of apocalyptic.
<P>
But even in individual conceptions the apocalyptic of the Baptist, and
of the period which he introduces, reaches back to the eschatology of
the prophetic writings. The pouring forth of the spirit, and the figure
of Elias, who comes again to earth, play a great role in it. The difficulty
is indeed, consciously felt of combining the two eschatologies, and
bringing the prophetic within the Danielic. How, it is asked, can the
Son of David be at the same time the Danielic Son-of-Man Messiah, at
once David's son and David's Lord?
<P>
It is inadequate to speak of a synthesis of the two eschatologies. What
has happened is nothing less than the remoulding, the elevation, of the
Daniel-Enoch apocalyptic by the spirit and conceptions belonging to
the ancient prophetic hope.
<P>
A great simplification and deepening of eschatology begins to show
itself even in the Psalms of Solomon. The conception of righteousness
which the writer applies is, in spite of its legal aspect, of an ethical,
prophetic character. It is an eschatology associated with great historical
events, the eschatology of a Pharisaism which is fighting for a cause,
and has therefore a certain inward greatness. [1] Between the Psalms of
Solomon and the appearance of the Baptist there lies the decadence of
Pharisaism. At this point there suddenly appears an eschatological
movement detached from Pharisaism, which was declining into an external legalism, a movement resting on a basis of its own, and thoroughly
penetrated with the spirit of the ancient prophets.
<P>
The ultimate differentia of this eschatology is that it was not, like
the other apocalyptic movements, called into existence by historical
events. The Apocalypse of Daniel was called forth by the religious
oppression of Antiochus; [2] the Psalms of Solomon by the civil strife
<P>
[1] The fact that in the Psalms of Solomon the Messiah is designated by the
ancient prophetic name of the Son of David is significant of the rising influence of
the ancient prophetic literature. This designation has nothing whatever to do with
a political ideal of a kingly Messiah. This Davidic King and his Kingdom are, in
their character and the manner of their coming, every whit as supernatural as the
Son of Man and His coming. The same historical fact was read into both Daniel
and the prophets.
<P>
[2] Enoch is an offshoot of the Danielic apocalyptic writings. The earliest portion,
the Apocalypse of the Ten Weeks, is independent of Daniel and of contemporary
origin. The Similitudes (capp. xxxvii.-lxix.), which, with their description of the
Judgment of the Son of Man, are so important in connexion with the thoughts of
Jesus, may be placed in 80-70 B.C. They do not presuppose the taking of Jerusalem
by Pompey.
<P>
<center>370</center>
<P>
at Jerusalem and the first appearance of the Roman power under
Pompey; [l] Fourth Ezra and Baruch by the destruction of Jerusalem. [2]
The apocalyptic movement in the time of Jesus is not connected with
any historical event. It cannot be said, as Bruno Bauer rightly perceived
that we know anything about the Messianic expectations of the Jewish
people at that time. [3] On the contrary, the indifference shown by the
Roman administration towards the movement proves that the Romans
knew nothing of a condition of great and general Messianic excitement
among the Jewish people. The conduct of the Pharisaic party also, and
the indifference of the great mass of the people, show that there can have
been no question at that time of a national movement. What is really
remarkable about this wave of apocalyptic enthusiasm is the fact that
it was called forth not by external events, but solely by the appearance
of two great personalities, and subsides with their disappearance, without leaving among the people generally any trace, except a feeling of
hatred towards the new sect.
<P>
The Baptist and Jesus are not, therefore, borne upon the current of
a general eschatological movement. The period offers no events calculated to give an impulse to eschatological enthusiasm. They themselves
set the times in motion by acting, by creating eschatological facts. It
is this mighty creative force which constitutes the difficulty in grasping
historically the eschatology of Jesus and the Baptist. Instead of literary
artifice speaking out of a distant imaginary past, there now enter into
the field of eschatology men, living, acting men. It was the only time
when that ever happened in Jewish eschatology.
<P>
There is silence all around. The Baptist appears, and cries: "Repent,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Soon after that comes Jesus,
and in the knowledge that He is the coming Son of Man lays hold of
the wheel of the world to set it moving on that last revolution which is
to bring all ordinary history to a close. It refuses to turn, and He throws
<P>
[1] The Psalms of Solomon are therefore a decade later than the Similitudes.
<P>
[2] The Apocalypse of Baruch seems to have been composed not very long after
the Fall of Jerusalem. Fourth Ezra is twenty to thirty years later.
<P>
[3] The Psalms of Solomon form the last document of Jewish eschatology before
the coming of the Baptist. For almost a hundred years, from 60 B.C. until A.D. 30,
we have no information regarding eschatological movements! And do the Psalms
of Solomon really point to a deep eschatological movement at the time of the
taking of Jerusalem by Pompey? Hardly, I think. It is to be noticed in studying
the times of Jesus that the surrounding circumstances have no eschatological
character. The Fall of Jerusalem marks the next turning-point in the history ot
apocalyptic hope, as Baruch and Fourth Ezra show.
<P>
<center>371</center>
<P>
Himself upon it. Then it does turn; and crushes Him. Instead of bringing
in the eschatological conditions, He has destroyed them. The wheel
rolls onward, and the mangled body of the one immeasurably great
Man, who was strong enough to think of Himself as the spiritual ruler
of mankind and to bend history to His purpose, is hanging upon it still.
That is His victory and His reign.
<P>
These considerations regarding the distinctive character of the Synoptic
eschatology were necessary in order to explain the significance
of the sending forth of the disciples and the discourse which Jesus
uttered upon that occasion. Jesus' purpose is to set in motion the eschatological
development of history, to let loose the final woes, the confusion
and strife, from which shall issue the Parousia, and so to introduce
the supra-mundane phase of the eschatological drama. That is His
task, for which He has authority here below. That is why He says in
the same discourse, "Think not that I am come to send peace on the
earth; I am not come to send peace, but a sword" (Matt. x. 34).
<P>
It was with a view to this initial movement that He chose His disciples.
They are not His helpers in the work of teaching; we never see
them in that capacity, and He did not prepare them to carry on that
work after His death. The very fact that He chooses just twelve shows
that it is a dogmatic idea which He has in mind. He chooses them as
those who are destined to hurl the firebrand into the world, and are
afterwards, as those who have been the comrades of the unrecognised
Messiah, before He came to His Kingdom, to be His associates in ruling
and judging it. [1]
<P>
But what was to be the fate of the future Son of Man during the
Messianic woes of the last times? It appears as if it was appointed for
<P>
[1] Jesus promises them expressly that at the appearing of the Son of Man they
shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. xix. 28). It
is to their part in the judgment that belong also the authority to bind and to loose
which He entrusts to them-first to Peter personally (Matt. xvi. 19) and afterwards
to all the Twelve (Matt. xviii. 18)-in such a way, too, that their present decisions
will be somehow or other binding at the Judgment. Or does the "upon earth"
refer only to the fact that the Messianic Last Judgment will be held on earth? "I
give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven" (Matt. xvi. 19). Why should these words not be historical? Is
it because in the same context Jesus speaks of the "church" which He will found
upon the Rock-disciple? But if one has once got a clear idea from Paul, 2 Clement,
the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Shepherd of Hermans, what the pre-existing
"church" was which was to appear in the last times, it will no longer appear
impossible that Jesus might have spoken of the church against which the gates of
hell shall not prevail. Of course, if the passage is given an uneschatological reference
to the Church as we know it, it loses all real meaning and becomes a treasure-trove
to the Roman Catholic exegete, and a terror to the Protestant.
<P>
<center>372</center>
<P>
Him to share the persecution and the suffering. He says that those wh
shall be saved must take their cross and follow Him (Matt. x. 38), that
His followers must be willing to lose their lives for His sake, and that
only those who in this time of terror confess their allegiance to Him
shall be confessed by Him before His heavenly Father (Matt. x. 32).
Similarly, in the last of the Beatitudes, He had pronounced those blessed
who were despised and persecuted for His sake (Matt. v. 11, 12). As the
future bearer of the supreme rule He must go through the deepest
humiliation. There is danger that His followers may doubt Him. Therefore,
the last words of His message to the Baptist, just at the time when
He had sent forth the Twelve, is, "Blessed is he whosoever shall not be
offended in me" (Matt. xi. 6).
<P>
If He makes a point of familiarising others with the thought that in
the time of tribulation they may even lose their lives. He must have
recognised that this possibility was still more strongly present in His
own case. It is possible that in the enigmatic saying about the disciples
fasting "when the bridegroom is taken away from them" (Mark ii. 20),
there is a hint of what Jesus expected. In that case suffering, death, and
resurrection must have been closely united in the Messianic consciousness
from the first. So much, however, is certain, viz. that the thought of
suffering formed part, at the time of the sending forth the disciples, of
the mystery of the Kingdom of God and of the Messiahship of Jesus,
and that in the form that Jesus and all the elect were to be brought low
in the <font face="Symbol">peirasmoV</font> at the time of the death-struggle against the evil world-power which would arise against them; brought down, it might be,
even to death. It mattered as little in His own case as in that of others
whether at the time of the Parousia He should be one of those who
should be metamorphosed, or one who had died and risen again. The
question arises, however, how this self-consciousness of Jesus could remain concealed. It is true the miracles had nothing to do with the Messiahship, since no one expected the Messiah to come as an earthly
miracle-worker in the present age. On the contrary, it would have been
the greatest of miracles if any one had recognised the Messiah in an
earthly miracle-worker. How far the cries of the demoniacs who addressed Him as Messiah were intelligible by the people must remain
an open question. What is clear is that His Messiahship did not become
known in this way even to His disciples.
<P>
And yet in all His speech and action the Messianic consciousness
shines forth. One might, indeed, speak of the acts of His Messianic consciousness. The Beatitudes, nay, the whole of the Sermon on the Mount,
with the authoritative "I" for ever breaking through, bear witness to
the high dignity which He ascribed to Himself. Did not this "I" set
the people thinking?
<P>
<center>373</center>
<P>
What must they have thought when, at the close of this discourse,
He spoke of people who, at the Day of Judgment, would call upon Him
as Lord, and appeal to the works that they had done in His name, and
who yet were destined to be rejected because He would not recognise
them (Matt. vii. 21-23)?
<P>
What must they have thought of Him when He pronounced those
blessed who were persecuted and despised for His sake (Matt. v. 11,
12)? By what authority did this man forgive sins (Mark ii. 5 ff.)?
<P>
In the discourse at the sending forth of the disciples the "I" is still
more prominent. He demands of men that in the trials to come they shall
confess Him, that they shall love Him more than father or mother, bear
their cross after Him, and follow Him to the death, since it is only for
such that He can entreat His Heavenly Father (Matt. x. 32 ff.). Admitting that the expression "Heavenly Father" contained no riddle for
the listening disciples, since He had taught them to pray "Our Father
which art in Heaven," we have still to ask who was He whose yea or
nay should prevail with God to determine the fate of men at the Judgment?
<P>
And yet they found it hard, nay impossible, to think of Him as
Messiah. They guessed Him to be a prophet; some thought of Elias,
some of John the Baptist risen from the dead, as appears clearly from
the answer of the disciples at Caesarea Philippi. [1] The Messiah was a
supernatural personality who was to appear in the last times, and who
was not expected upon earth before that.
<P>
At this point a difficulty presents itself. How could Jesus be Elias for
the people? Did they not hold John the Baptist to be Elias? Not in
the least! Jesus was the first and the only person who attributed this
office to him. And, moreover, He declares it to the people as something
mysterious, difficult to understand-"If ye can receive it, this is Elias,
which was for to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear" (Matt.
xi. 14, 15). In making this revelation He is communicating to them a
piece of supernatural knowledge, opening up a part of the mystery of
the Kingdom of God. Therefore He uses the same formula of emphasis
as when making known in parables the mystery of the Kingdom of God
(Mark iv.).
<P>
The disciples were not with Him at this time, and therefore did not
learn what was the role of John the Baptist. When a little later, in de-
<P>
[1] That he could be taken for the Baptist risen from the dead shows how short a
time before the death of the Baptist His ministry had begun. He only became
known, as the Baptist's question shows, at the time of the mission of the disciples;
Herod first heard of Him after the death of the Baptist. Had he known anything of
Jesus beforehand, it would have been impossible for him suddenly to identify Him
with the Baptist risen from the dead. This elementary consideration has been
overlooked in all calculations of the length of the public ministry of Jesus.
<P>
<center>374</center>
<P>
scending from the mount of transfiguration He predicted to the three
who formed the inner circle of His followers the resurrection of the Son
of Man, they came to Him with difficulties about the rising from the
dead-how could this be possible when, according to the Pharisees and
Scribes, Elias must first come?-whereupon Jesus explains to them that
the preacher of repentance whom Herod had put to death had been Elias
(Mark ix. 11-13).
<P>
Why did not the people take the Baptist to be Elias? In the first
place no doubt because he did not describe himself as such. In the next
place because he did no miracle! He was only a natural man without
any evidence of supernatural power, only a prophet. In the third place,
and that was the decisive point, he had himself pointed forward to the
coming of Elias. He who was to come, he whom he preached, was not
the Messiah, but Elias.
<P>
He describes him, not as a supernatural personality, not as a judge,
not as one who will be manifested at the unveiling of the heavenly world,
but as one who in his work shall resemble himself, only much greater-one who, like himself, baptizes, though with the Holy Spirit. Had it
ever been represented as the work of the Messiah to baptize?
<P>
Before the Last Judgment, so it was inferred from Joel, the great
outpouring of the spirit was to take place; before the Last Judgment, so
taught Malachi, Elias was to corns. Until these events had occurred the
manifestation of the Son of Man was not to be looked for. Men's thoughts
were fixed, therefore, not on the Messiah, but upon Elias and the outpouring of the Spirit. [1] The Baptist in his preaching combines both ideas,
and predicts the coming of the Great One who shall "baptize with the
Holy Spirit," i.e. who brings about the outpouring of the Spirit. His
own preaching was only designed to secure that at His coming that
Great One should find a community sanctified and prepared to receive
the Spirit.
<P>
When he heard in the prison of one who did great wonders and signs,
he desired to learn with certainty whether this was "he who was to
come." If this question is taken as referring to the Messiahship the
whole narrative loses its meaning, and it upsets the theory of the Messianic secret, since in this case at least one person had become aware,
independently, of the office which belonged to Jesus, not to mention all
the ineptitudes involved in making the Baptist here speak in doubt and
confusion. Moreover, on this false interpretation of the question the
point of Jesus' discourse is lost, for in this case it is not clear why he
says to the people afterwards, "If ye can receive it, John himself is
Elias." This revelation presupposes that Jesus and the people, who had
<P>
[1] That had been rightly remarked by Colani. Later, however, theology lost sign
of the fact because it did not know how to make any historical use of it.
<P>
<center>375</center>
<P>
heard the question which had been addressed to Him, also gave it its
only natural meaning, referring it to Jesus as the bearer of the office
of Elias.
<P>
That even the first Evangelist gives the episode a Messianic setting
by introducing it with the words "When John heard in the prison of the
works of the Christ" does not alter the facts of the body of the narrative.
The sequel directly contradicts the introduction. And this interpretation
fully explains the evasive answer of Jesus, in which exegesis has always
recognised a certain reserve without ever being able to make it intelligible
why Jesus did not simply send him the message, "Yes, I am he"-whereto, however, according to modern theology, He would have
needed to add, "but another kind of Messiah from him whom you expect.
<P>
The fact was, the Baptist had put Him in an extremely difficult position. He could not answer that He was Elias if He held Himself to be
the Messiah; on the other hand He could not, and would not, disclose
to him, and still less to the messengers and the listening multitude, the
secret of His Messiahship. Therefore He sends this obscure message,
which only contains a confirmation of the facts which John had already
heard and closes with a warning, come what may, not to be offended
in Him. Of this the Baptist was to make what he could.
<P>
It mattered, in fact, little how John understood the message. The time
was much more advanced than he supposed; the hammer of the world's
clock had risen to strike the last hour. All that he needed to know was
that he had no cause to doubt.
<P>
In revealing to the people the true office of the Baptist, Jesus unveiled to them almost the whole mystery of the Kingdom of God, and
nearly disclosed the secret of His Messiahship. For if Elias was already
present, was not the coming of the Kingdom close at hand? And if
John was Elias, who was Jesus? . . . There could only be one answer;
the Messiah. But this seemed impossible, because Messiah was expected
as a supernatural personality. The eulogy on the Baptist is, historically
regarded, identical in content with the prediction of the Parousia in the
discourse at the sending forth of the disciples. For after the coming of
Elias there must follow immediately the judgment and the other events
belonging to the last time. Now we can understand why in the enumeration
of the events of the last time in the discourse to the Twelve the
coming of Elias is not mentioned.
<P
We see here, too, how, in the thought of Jesus, Messianic doctrine
forces its way into history and simply abolishes the historic aspect of
the events. The Baptist had not held himself to be Elias, the people
had not thought of attributing this office to him; the description of Elias
did not fit him at all, since he had done none of those things which
<P>
<center>376</center>
<P>
Elias was to do: and yet Jesus makes him Elias, simply because He expected
His own manifestation as Son of Man, and before that it was
necessary that Elias must first have come. And even when John was
dead Jesus still told the disciples that in him Elias had come, although
the death of Elias was not contemplated in the eschatological doctrine
and was in fact unthinkable. But Jesus must somehow drag or force the
eschatological events into the framework of the actual occurrences.
<P>
Thus the conception of the "dogmatic element" in the narrative widens
in an unsuspected fashion. And even what before seemed natural becomes on a closer examination doctrinal. The Baptist is made into Elias
solely by the force of Jesus' Messianic consciousness.
<P>
A short time afterwards, immediately upon the return of the disciples, He spoke and acted before their eyes in a way which presupposed
the Messianic secret. The people had been dogging his steps; at a lonely
spot on the shores of the lake they surrounded Him, and He "taught
them about many things" (Mark vi. 30-34). The day was drawing to
a close, but they held closely to Him without troubling about food. In
the evening, before sending them away, He fed them.
<P>
Weisse, long ago, had constantly emphasised the fact that the feeding
of the multitude was one of the greatest historical problems, because
this narrative, like that of the transfiguration, is very firmly riveted to
its historical setting and, therefore, imperatively demands explanation.
How is the historical element in it to be got at? Certainly not by seeking
to explain the apparently miraculous in it on natural lines, by representing that at the bidding of Jesus people brought out the baskets of provisions which they had been concealing, and, thus importing into the
tradition a natural fact which, so far from being hinted at in the narrative, is actually excluded by it.
<P>
Our solution is that the whole is historical, except the closing remark
that they were all filled. Jesus distributed the provisions which He and
His disciples had with them among the multitude so that each received
a very little, after He had first offered thanks. The significance lies in
the giving of thanks and in the fact that they had received from Him
consecrated food. Because He is the future Messiah, this meal becomes
without their knowledge the Messianic feast. With the morsel of bread
which He gives His disciples to distribute to the people He consecrates
them as partakers in the coming Messianic feast, and gives them the
guarantee that they, who had shared His table in the time of His obscurity, would also share it in the time of His glory. In the prayer He
gave thanks not only for the food, but also for the coming Kingdom and
all its blessings. It is the counterpart of the Lord's prayer, where He so
strangely inserts the petition for daily bread between the petitions tor
the coming of the Kingdom and for deliverance from the <font face="Symbol">peirasmoV</font>.
<P>
<center>377</center>
<P>
The feeding of the multitude was more than a love-feast, a fellowship-meal. It was from the point of view of Jesus a sacrament of salvation.
<P>
We never realise sufficiently that in a period when the judgment and
the glory were expected as close at hand, one thought arising out of
this expectation must have acquired special prominence-how, namely,
in the present time a man could obtain a guarantee of coming scatheless through the judgment, of being saved and received into the Kingdom, of being signed and sealed for deliverance amid the coming trial,
as the Chosen People in Egypt had a sign revealed to them from God
by means of which they might be manifest as those who were to be
spared. But once we do realise this, we can understand why the thought
of signing and sealing runs through the whole of the apocalyptic literature. It is found as early as the ninth chapter of Ezekiel. There, God is
making preparation for judgment. The day of visitation of the city is
at hand. But first the Lord calls unto "the man clothed with linen who
had the writer's ink-horn by his side" and said unto him, "Go through
the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark
upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof." Only after that does He give
command to those who are charged with the judgment to begin, adding,
"But come not near any man upon whom is the mark" (Ezek. ix. 4
and 6).
<P>
In the fifteenth of the Psalms of Solomon, [1] the last eschatological writing before the movement initiated by the Baptist, it is expressly said in
the description of the judgment that "the saints of God bear a sign
upon them which saves them."
<P>
In the Pauline theology very striking prominence is given to the
thought of being sealed unto salvation. The apostle is conscious of bearing about with him in his body "the marks of Jesus" (Gal. vi. 17), the
"dying" of Jesus (2 Cor. iv. 10). This sign is received in baptism, since
it is a baptism "into the death of Christ"; in this act the recipient is in
a certain sense really buried with Him, and thenceforth walks among
Men as one who belongs, even here below, to risen humanity (Rom. vi.
1 ff.). Baptism is the seal, the earnest of the spirit, the pledge of that
which is to come (2 Cor. i. 22; Eph. i. 13, 14, iv. 30).
<P>
This conception of baptism as a "salvation" in view of that which
was to come goes down through the whole of ancient theology. Its
preaching might really be summed up in the words, "Keep your baptism
holy and without blemish."
<P>
In the Shepherd of Hermas even the spirits of the men of the past
must receive "the seal, which is the water" in order that they may "bear
the name of God upon them." That is why the tower is built over the
<P>
[1] Psal. Sol. xv. 8.
<P>
<center>378</center>
<P>
water, and the stones which are brought up out of the deep are rolled
through the water (Vis. iii. and Sim. ix. 16).
<P>
In the Apocalypse of John the thought of the sealing stands prominently in the foreground. The locusts receive power to hurt those only
who have not the seal of God on their foreheads (Rev. ix. 4, 5). The
beast (Rev. xiii. 16 ff.) compels men to bear his mark; only those who
will not accept it are to reign with Christ (Rev. xx. 4), The chosen
hundred and forty-four thousand bear the name of God and the name
of the Lamb upon their foreheads (Rev. xiv. 1).
<P>
"Assurance of salvation" in a time of eschatological expectation demanded
some kind of security for the future of which the earnest could
be possessed in the present. And with this the pre-destinarian thought
of election was in complete accord. If we find the thought of being sealed
unto salvation previously in the Psalms of Solomon, and subsequently
in the same signification in Paul, in the Apocalypse of John, and down
to the Shepherd of Hermas, it may be assumed in advance that it will
be found in some form or other in the so strongly eschatological teaching
of Jesus and the Baptist.
<P>
It may be said, indeed, to dominate completely the eschatological
preaching of the Baptist, for this preaching does not confine itself to the
declaration of the nearness of the Kingdom, and the demand for repentance,
but leads up to an act to which it gives a special reference in
relation to the forgiveness of sins and the outpouring of the spirit. It is
a mistake to regard baptism with water as a "symbolic act" in the
modern sense, and make the Baptist decry his own wares by saying, "I
baptize only with water, but the other can baptize with the Holy Spirit."
He is not contrasting the two baptisms, but connecting them-he who
is baptized by him has the certainty that he will share in the outpouring
of the Spirit which shall precede the judgment, and at the judgment shall
receive forgiveness of sins, as one who is signed with the mark of repentance.
The object of being baptized by him is to secure baptism with
the Spirit later. The forgiveness of sins associated with baptism is proleptic,
it is to be realised at the judgment. The Baptist himself did not
forgive sin. [1] If he had done so, how could such offence have been taken
when Jesus claimed for Himself the right to forgive sins in the present
(Mark ii. 10)?
<P>
The baptism of John was therefore an eschatological sacrament point-
<P>
[1] That the baptism of John was essentially an act which gave a claim to something future may be seen from the fact that Jesus speaks of His sufferings and death
as a special baptism, and asks the sons of Zebedee whether they are willing, for the
sake of gaining the thrones on His right hand and His left, to undergo this baptism.
If the baptism of John had had no real sacramental significance it would
unintelligible that Jesus should use this metaphor.
<P>
<center>379</center>
<P>
ing forward to the pouring forth of the spirit and to the judgment, a
provision for "salvation." Hence the wrath of the Baptist when he saw
Pharisees and Sadducees crowding to his baptism: "Ye generation of
vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring
forth now fruits meet for repentance" (Matt. iii. 7, 8). By the reception
of baptism, that is, they are saved from the judgment.
<P>
As a cleansing unto salvation it is a divine institution, a revealed
means of grace. That is why the question of Jesus, whether the baptism
of John was from heaven or from men, placed the Scribes at Jerusalem
in so awkward a dilemma (Mark xi. 30).
<P>
The authority of Jesus, however, goes farther than that of the Baptist.
As the Messiah who is to come He can give even here below to those
who gather about Him a right to partake in the Messianic feast, by this
distribution of food to them; only, they do not know what is happening
to them and He cannot solve the riddle for them. The supper at the
Lake of Gennesareth was a veiled eschatological sacrament. Neither the
disciples nor the multitude understood what was happening, since they
did not know who He was who thus made them His guests. [1] This meal
<P>
[1] The thought of the Messianic feast is found in Isaiah lv. 1 ff. and lxv. 12 ff.
It is very strongly marked in Isa. xxv. 6-8, a passage which perhaps dates from the
time of Alexander the Great, "and Jahweh of Hosts will prepare upon this mountain
for all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wine on the lees, of fat things prepared
with marrow, of wine on the lees well refined. He shall destroy, in this mountain,
among all peoples, the veil which has veiled all peoples and the covering which has
covered all nations. He shall destroy death for ever, and the Lord Jahweh shall
wipe away the tears from off all faces; and the reproach of His people shall disappear from the earth." (The German follows Kautzsch's translation.)
<P>
In Enoch xxiv. and xxv. the conception of the Messianic feast is connected with
that of the tree of life which shall offer its fruits to the elect upon the mountain of
the King. Similarly in the Testament of Levi, cap. xviii. 11.
<P>
The decisive passage is in Enoch lxii. 14. After the Parousia of the Son of Man,
and after the Judgment, the elect who have been saved "shall eat with the Son of
Man, shall sit down and rise up with Him to all eternity."
<P>
Jesus' references to the Messianic feast are therefore not merely images, but point
to a reality. In Matt. viii. 11 and 12 He prophesies that many shall come from the
East and from the West to sit at meat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In Matt.
xxii. 1-14 the Messianic feast is pictured as a royal marriage, in Matt. xxv. 1-13 as
a marriage feast.
<P>
The Apocalypse is dominated by the thought of the feast in all its forms. In
Rev. ii. 7 it appears in connexion with the thought of the tree of life; in ii. 17
it is pictured as a feeding with manna; in iii. 21 it is the feast which the Lord will
celebrate with His followers; in vii. 16, 17 there is an allusion to the Lamb who
shall feed His own so that they shall no more hunger or thirst; chapter xix. describes
the marriage feast of the Lamb.
<P>
The Messianic feast therefore played a dominant part in the conception of
blessedness from Enoch to the Apocalypse of John. From this we can estimate
what sacramental significance a guarantee of taking part in that feast must have
had. The meaning of the celebration was obvious in itself, and was made manifest in
the conduct of it. The sacramental effect was wholly independent of the apprehension and comprehension of the recipient. Therefore, in this also the meal at the
lake-side was a true sacrament.
<P>
<center>380</center>
<P>
must have been transformed by tradition into a miracle, a result which
may have been in part due to the references to the wonders of the Messianic feast which were doubtless contained in the prayers, not to speak
of the eschatological enthusiasm which then prevailed universally. Did
not the disciples believe that on the same evening, when they had been
commanded to take Jesus into their ship at the mouth of the Jordan
to which point He had walked along the shore-did they not believe that
they saw Him come walking towards them upon the waves of the sea?
The impulse to the introduction of the miraculous into the narrative
came from the unintelligible element with which the men who surrounded
Jesus were at this time confronted. [1]
<P>
The Last Supper at Jerusalem had the same sacramental significance
as that at the lake. Towards the end of the meal Jesus, after giving
thanks, distributes the bread and wine. This had as little to do with the
satisfaction of hunger as the distribution to the Galilaean believers.
The act of Jesus is an end in itself, and the significance of the celebration
consists in the fact that it is He Himself who makes the distribution.
In Jerusalem, however, they understood what was meant, and He explained
it to them explicitly by telling them that He would drink no
more of the fruit of the vine until He drank it new in the Kingdom of
God. The mysterious images which He used at the time of the distribution
concerning the atoning significance of His death do not touch
the essence of the celebration, they are only discourses accompanying it.
<P>
On this interpretation, therefore, we may think of Baptism and the
Lord's Supper as from the first eschatological sacraments in the eschatological
movement which later detached itself from Judaism under the
name of Christianity. That explains why we find them both in Paul and
in the earliest theology as sacramental acts, not as symbolic ceremonies,
and find them dominating the whole Christian doctrine. Apart from the
assumption of the eschatological sacraments, we can only make the
history of dogma begin with a "fall" from the earlier purer theology
into the sacramental magical, without being able to adduce a single
syllable in support of the idea that after the death of Jesus Baptism and
the Lord's Supper existed even for an hour as symbolical actions-Paul, indeed, makes this supposition wholly impossible.
<P>
In any case the adoption of the baptism of John in Christian practice
cannot be explained except on the assumption that it was the sacrament
<P>
[1] Weisse rightly remarks that the task of the historian in dealing with Mark must
consist in explaining how such "myths" could be accepted by a chronicler who
stood so relatively near the events as our Mark does.
<P>
<center>381</center>
<P>
of the eschatological community, a revealed means of securing "salvation"
which was not altered in the slightest by the Messiahship of Jesus.
How else could we explain the fact that baptism, without any commandment
of Jesus, and without Jesus' ever having baptized, was taken over,
as a matter of course, into Christianity, and was given a special reference
to the receiving of the Spirit?
<P>
It is no use proposing to explain it as having been instituted as a
symbolical repetition of the baptism of Jesus, thought of as "an anointing
to the Messiahship." There is not a single passage in ancient theology
to support such a theory. And we may point also to the fact that
Paul never refers to the baptism of Jesus in explaining the character
of Christian baptism, never, in fact, makes any distinct reference to it.
And how could baptism, if it had been a symbolical repetition of the
baptism of Jesus, ever nave acquired this magic-sacramental sense of
"salvation"?
<P>
Nothing shows more clearly than the dual character of ancient baptism,
which makes it the guarantee both of the reception of the Spirit
and of deliverance from the judgment, that it is nothing else than the
eschatological baptism of John with a single difference. Baptism with
water and baptism with the Spirit are now connected not only logically,
but also in point of time, seeing that since the day of Pentecost the
period of the outpouring of the Spirit is present. The two portions of
the eschatological sacrament which in the Baptist's preaching were distinguished
in point of time-because he did not expect the outpouring
of the Spirit until some future period-are now brought together, since
one eschatological condition-the baptism with the Spirit-is now
present. The "Christianising" of baptism consisted in this and in nothing
else; though Paul carried it a stage farther when he formed the conception
of baptism as a mystic partaking in the death and resurrection
of Jesus.
<P>
Thus the thoroughgoing eschatological interpretation of the Life of
Jesus puts into the hands of those who are reconstructing the history of
dogma in the earliest times an explanation of the conception of the
sacraments, of which they had been able hitherto only to note the presence
as an <i>x</i> of which the origin was undiscoverable, and for which they
possessed no equation by which it could be evaluated. If Christianity as
the religion of historically revealed mysteries was able to lay hold upon
Hellenism and overcome it, the reason of this was that it was already in
its purely eschatological beginnings a religion of sacraments, a religion
of eschatological sacraments, since Jesus had recognised a Divine institution in the baptism of John, and had Himself performed a sacramental
action in the distribution of food at the Lake of Gennesareth and at the
Last Supper.
<P>
This being so, the feeding of the multitude also belongs to the dogmatic
<P>
<center>382</center>
<P>
element in the history. But no one had previously recognised it as what
it really was, an indirect disclosure of the Messianic secret, just as no
one had understood the full significance of Jesus' description of the
Baptist as Elias.
<P>
But how does Peter at Caesarea Philippi know the secret of his
Master? What he there declares is not a conviction which had gradually
dawned on him, and slowly grown through various stages of probability
and certainty.
<P>
The real character of this incident has been interpreted with remarkable penetration by Wrede. The incident itself, he says, is to be understood in quite as supernatural a fashion in Mark as in Matthew. But on
the other hand one does not receive the impression that the writer intends to represent the confession as a merit or a discovery of Peter. "For
according to the text of Mark, Jesus shows no trace of joy or surprise
at this confession. His only answer consists of the command to say
nothing about His Messiahship." Keim, whom Wrede quotes, had received a similar impression from the Marcan account, and had supposed
that Jesus had actually found the confession of Peter inopportune.
<P>
How is all this to be explained-the supernatural knowledge of
Peter and the rather curt fashion in which Jesus receives his declaration?
<P>
It might be worth while to put the story of the transfiguration side by
side with the incident at Caesarea Philippi, since there the Divine Sonship of Jesus is "a second time" revealed to the "three," Peter, James,
and John, and the revelation is made supernaturally by a voice from
heaven. It is rather striking that Mark does not seem to be conscious
that he is reporting something which the disciples knew already. At the
beginning of the actual transfiguration Peter still addresses Jesus simply
as Rabbi (Mark ix. 5). And what does it mean when Jesus, during the
descent from the mountain, forbids them to speak to any man concerning that which they have seen until after the resurrection of the Son of
Man? That would exclude even the other disciples who knew only the
secret of His Messiahship. But why should they not be told of the Divine
confirmation of that which Peter had declared at Caesarea Philippi and
Jesus had "admitted"?
<P>
What has the transfiguration to do with the resurrection of the dead?
And why are the thoughts of the disciples suddenly busied, not with
what they have seen, not with the fact that the Son of Man shall rise
from the dead, but simply with the possibility of the rising from the
dead, the difficulty being that Elias was not yet present? Those who see
in the transfiguration a projection backwards of the Pauline theology
into the Gospel history do not realise what are the principal points and
difficulties of the narrative. The problem lies in the conversation during
<P>
<center>383</center>
<P>
the descent. Against the Messiahship of Jesus, against His rising from
the dead, they have only one objection to suggest: Elias had not yet
come.
<P>
We see here, in the first place, the importance of the revelation which
Jesus had made to the people in declaring to them the secret that the
Baptist is Elias. From the standpoint of the eschatological expectation
no one could recognise Elias in the Baptist, unless he knew of the Messiahship of Jesus. And no one could believe in the Messiahship and
"resurrection" of Jesus, that is, in His Parousia, without presupposing
that Elias had in some way or other already come. This was therefore
the primary difficulty of the disciples, the stumbling-block which Jesus
must remove for them by making the same revelation concerning the
Baptist to them as to the people. It is also once more abundantly clear
that expectation was directed at that time primarily to the coming of
Elias. [1] But since the whole eschatological movement arose out of the
Baptist's preaching, the natural conclusion is that by "him who was
to come after" and baptize with the Holy Spirit John meant, not the
Messiah, but Elias.
<P>
But if the non-appearance of Elias was the primary difficulty of the
disciples in connexion with the Messiahship of Jesus and all that it
implied, why does it only strike the "three," and moreover, all three
of them together, now, and not at Caesarea Philippi? [2] How could Peter
there have declared it and here be still labouring with the rest over the
difficulty which stood in the way of his own declaration? To make the
narrative coherent, the transfiguration, as being a revelation of the
Messiahship, ought to precede the incident at Caesarea Philippi. Now
let us look at the connexion in which it actually occurs. It falls in that
inexplicable section Mark viii. 34-ix. 30 in which the multitude suddenly
appears in the company of Jesus who is sojourning in a Gentile
district, only to disappear again, equally enigmatically, afterwards,
when He sets out for Galilee, instead of accompanying Him back to
their own country.
<P>
In this section everything points to the situation during the days at
Bethsaida after the return of the disciples from their mission. Jesus is
surrounded by the people, while what He desires is to be alone with His
immediate followers. The disciples make use of the healing powers which
He had bestowed upon them when sending them forth, and have the experience
of finding that they are not in all cases adequate (Mark ix.
14-29). The mountain to which He takes the "three" is not a mountain
<P>
[1] It is to be noticed that the cry of Jesus from the cross, "Eli, Eli," was immediately interpreted by the bystanders as referring to Elias.
<P>
[2] From this difficulty we can see, too, how impossible it was for any of them to
have "arrived gradually at the knowledge of the Messiahship of Jesus."
<P>
<center>384</center>
<P>
in the north, or as some have suggested, an imaginary mountain of the
Evangelist, but the same to which Jesus went up to pray and to be alone
on the evening of the feeding of the multitude (Mark vi. 46 and ix. 2).
The house to which He goes after His return from the transfiguration is
therefore to be placed at Bethsaida.
<P>
Another thing which points to a sojourn at Bethsaida after the feeding
of the multitude is the story of the healing of the blind man at Bethsaida
(Mark viii. 22-26).
<P>
The circumstances, therefore, which we have to presuppose are that
Jesus is surrounded and thronged by the people at Bethsaida. In order
to be alone He once more puts the Jordan between Himself and the
multitude, and goes with the "three" to the mountain where He had
prayed after the feeding of the five thousand. This is the only way in
which we can understand how the people failed to follow Him, and He
was able really to carry out His plan.
<P>
But how could this story be torn out of its natural context and its
scene removed to Caesarea Philippi, where il is both on external and
internal grounds impossible? What we need to notice is the Marcan
account of the events which followed the sending forth of the disciples.
We have two stories of the feeding of the multitude with a crossing of
the lake after each (Mark vi. 31-56, Mark viii. 1-22), two stories of
Jesus going away towards the north with the same motive, that of being alone and unrecognised. The first time, after the controversy about
the washing of hands, His course is directed towards Tyre (Mark vii.
24-30), the second time, after the demand for a sign, he goes into the
district of Caesarea Philippi (Mark viii. 27). The scene of the controversy about the washing of hands is some locality in the plain of
Gennesareth (Mark vi. 53 ff.); Dalmanutha is named as the place where
the sign was demanded (Mark viii. 10 ff.).
<P>
The most natural conclusion is to identify the two cases of feeding
the multitude, and the two journeys northwards. In that case we should
have in the section Mark vi. 31-ix. 30, two sets of narratives worked
into one another, both recounting how Jesus, after the disciples came
back to Him, went with them from Capernaum to the northern shore
of the lake, was there surprised by the multitude, and after the meal
which He gave them, crossed the Jordan by boat to Bethsaida, stayed
there for a while, and then returned again by ship to the country of
Gennesareth, and was there again overtaken and surrounded by the
people; then after some controversial encounters with the Scribes, who
at the report of His miracles had come down from Jerusalem (Mark
vii. 1), left Galilee and again went northwards. [1]
<P>
The seams at the joining of the narratives can be recognised in Mark
<P>
[l] For the hypothesis of the two sets of narratives which have been worked into
one another, see the "Sketch of the Life of Jesus," 1901, p. 52 ff., "After the
Mission of the Disciples. Literary and historical problems." A theory resting on
the same principle was lately worked out in detail by Johannes Weiss, <i>Das alteste
Evangelium</i> (The Earliest Gospel), 1903, p. 205 ff.
<P>
<center>385</center>
<P>
vii. 31, where Jesus is suddenly transferred from the north to Decapolis,
and in the saying in Mark viii. 14 ff., which makes explicit reference to
the two miracles of feeding the multitude. Whether the Evangelist himself
worked these two sets of narratives together, or whether he found
them already united, cannot be determined, and is not of any direct
historical interest. The disorder is in any case so complete that we cannot
fully reconstruct each of the separate sets of narratives.
<P>
The external reasons why the narratives of Mark viii. 34-ix. 30, of
which the scene is on the northern shore of the lake, are placed in this
way after the incident of Caesarea Philippi are not difficult to grasp.
The section contains an impressive discourse to the people on following
Jesus in His sufferings, crucifixion, and death (Mark viii. 34-ix. 1).
For this reason the whole series of scenes is attached to the revelation,
of the secret of the suffering of the Son of Man; and the redactor did
not stop to think how the people could suddenly appear, and as suddenly disappear again. The statement, too, "He called the people with
the disciples" (Mark viii. 34), helped to mislead him into inserting
the section at this point, although this very remark points to the circumstances of the time just after the return of the disciples, when Jesus
was sometimes alone with the disciples, and sometimes calls the eager
multitude about Him.
<P>
The whole scene belongs, therefore, to the days which He spent at
Bethsaida, and originally followed immediately upon the crossing of
the lake, after the feeding of the multitude. It was after Jesus had been
six days surrounded by the people, not six days after the revelation at
Caesarea Philippi, that the "transfiguration" took place (Mark ix. 2).
On this assumption, all the difficulties of the incident at Caesarea Philippi
are cleared up in a moment; there is no longer anything strange in the
fact that Peter declares to Jesus who He really is, while Jesus appears
neither surprised nor especially rejoiced at the insight of His disciple.
The transfiguration had, in fact, been the revelation of the secret of the
Messiahship to the three who constituted the inner circle of the disciples. [1] And Jesus had not Himself revealed it to them; what had happened was, that in a state of rapture common to them all, in which they
<P>
[1] It is typical of the constant agreement of the critical conclusions in thoroughgoing scepticism and thoroughgoing eschatology that Wrede also observes: "The
transfiguration and Peter's confession are closely connected in content" (p. 123).
He also clearly perceives the inconsistency in the fact that Peter at Caesarea Philippi gives evidence of possessing a knowledge which he and his fellow-disciples do not show elsewhere (p. 119), but the fact that it is Peter, not Jesus,
who reveals the Messianic secret, constitutes a very serious difficulty for Wrede's
readirg of the facts, since this assumes Jesus to have been the revealer of it.
<P>
<Center>386</center>
<P>
had seen the Master in a glorious transfiguration, they had seen Him
talking with Moses and Elias and had heard a voice from heaven saying,
"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him."
<P>
We must always make a fresh effort to realise to ourselves, that Jesus
and His immediate followers were, at that time, in an enthusiastic state
of intense eschatological expectation. We must picture them among the
people, who were filled with penitence for their sins, and with faith in
the Kingdom, hourly expecting the coming of the Kingdom, and the
revelation of Jesus as the Son of Man, seeing in the eager multitude itself a sign that their reckoning of the time was correct; thus the psychological conditions were present for a common ecstatic experience
such as is described in the account of the transfiguration.
<P>
In this ecstasy the "three" heard the voice from heaven saying who
He was. Therefore, the Matthaean report, according to which Jesus
praises Simon "because flesh and blood have not revealed it to him, but
the Father who is in heaven," is not really at variance with the briefer
Marcan account, since it rightly indicates the source of Peter's knowledge.
<P>
Nevertheless Jesus was astonished. For Peter here disregarded the
command given during the descent from the mount of transfiguration.
He had "betrayed" to the Twelve Jesus' consciousness of His Messiahship. One receives the impression that Jesus did not put the question to
the disciples in order to reveal Himself to them as Messiah, and that
by the impulsive speech of Peter, upon whose silence He had counted
because of His command, and to whom He had not specially addressed
the question. He was forced to take a different line of action in regard
to the Twelve from what He had intended. It is probable that He had
never had the intention of revealing the secret of His Messiahship to
the disciples. Otherwise He would not have kept it from them at the
time of their mission, when He did not expect them to return before the
Parousia. Even at the transfiguration the "three" do not learn it from
His lips, but in a state of ecstasy, an ecstasy which He shared with them.
At Caesarea Philippi it is not He, but Peter, who reveals His Messiahship.
We may say, therefore, that Jesus did not voluntarily give up His
Messianic secret; it was wrung from Him by the pressure of events.
<P>
However that may be, from Caesarea Philippi onwards it was known
to the other disciples through Peter; what Jesus Himself revealed to
them, was the secret of his sufferings.
<P>
Pfleiderer and Wrede were quite right in pointing to the clear and
definite predictions of the suffering, death, and resurrection as the historically
inexplicable element in our reports, since the necessity of
Jesus' death, by which modern theology endeavours to make His resolve
and His predictions intelligible, is not a necessity which arises out of
<P>
<center>387</center>
<P>
the historical course of events. There was not present any natural ground
for such a resolve on the part of Jesus. Had He returned to Galilee, He
would immediately have had the multitudes flocking after Him again.
<P>
In order to make the historical possibility of the resolve to suffer
and the prediction of the sufferings in some measure intelligible, modern
theology has to ignore the prediction of the resurrection which is bound
up with them, for this is "dogmatic." That is, however, not permissible.
We must, as Wrede insists, take the words as they are, and must not
even indulge in ingenious explanations of the "three days." Therefore,
the resolve to suffer and to die are dogmatic; therefore, according to
him, they are unhistorical, and only to be explained by a literary hypothesis.
<P>
But the thoroughgoing eschatological school says they are dogmatic,
and therefore historical; because they find their explanation in eschatological conceptions.
<P>
Wrede held that the Messianic conception implied in the Marcan
narrative is not the Jewish Messianic conception, just because of the
thought of suffering and death which it involves. No stress must be laid
on the fact that in Fourth Ezra vii. 29 the Christ dies and rises again,
because His death takes place at the end of the Messianic Kingdom. [1]
The Jewish Messiah is essentially a glorious being who shall appear in
the last time. True, but the case in which the Messiah should be present,
prior to the Parousia, should cause the final tribulations to come upon
the earth, and should Himself undergo them, does not arise in the Jewish
eschatology as described from without. It first arises with the self-consciousness of Jesus. Therefore, the Jewish conception of the Messiah has
no information to give us upon this point.
<P>
In order to understand Jesus' resolve to suffer, we must first recognise
that the mystery of this suffering is involved in the mystery of the Kingdom of God, since the Kingdom cannot come until the <font face="Symbol">peirasmoV</font> has
taken place. This certainty of suffering is quite independent of the historic circumstances, as the beatitude on the persecuted in the sermon
on the mount, and the predictions in the discourse at the sending forth
of the Twelve, clearly show. Jesus' prediction of His own sufferings at
Caesarea Philippi is precisely as unintelligible, precisely as dogmatic,
and therefore precisely as historical as the prediction to the disciples
at the time of their mission. The "must be" of the sufferings is the same-the coming of the Kingdom, and of the Parousia, which are dependent
upon the <font face="Symbol">peirasmoV</font> having first taken place.
<P>
[1] "After these years shall my Son, the Christ, die, together with all who have the
breath of men. Then shall the Age be changed into the primeval silence; seven
dys, as at the first beginning so that no man shall be left. After seven days shall
the Age, which now sleeps, awake, and perishability shall itself perish."
<P>
<center>388</center>
<P>
In the first period Jesus' thoughts concerning His own sufferings
were included in the more general thought 01 the sufferings which formed
part of the mystery of the Kingdom of God. The exhortations to hold
steadfastly to Him in the time of trial, and not to lose faith in Him
certainly tended to suggest that He thought of Himself as the central
point amid these conflicts and confusions, and reckoned on the possibility of His own death as much as on that of others. Upon this point
nothing more definite can be said, since the mystery of Jesus' own sufferings does not detach itself from the mystery of the sufferings connected with the Kingdom of God until after the Messianic secret is made
known at Caesarea Philippi. What is certain is that, for Him, suffering
was always associated with the Messianic secret, since He placed His
Parousia at the end of the pre-Messianic tribulations in which He was to
have His part.
<P>
The suffering, death, and resurrection of which the secret was revealed
at Caesarea Philippi are not therefore in themselves new or surprising. [1]
The novelty lies in the form in which they are conceived. The tribulation,
so far as Jesus is concerned, is now connected with an historic event:
He will go to Jerusalem, there to suffer death at the hands of the authorities.
<P>
For the future, however, He no longer speaks of the general tribulation which He is to bring upon the earth, nor of the sufferings which
await His followers, nor of the sufferings in which they must rally
round Him. In the predictions of the passion there is no word of that;
<P>
[1] Difficult problems are involved in the prediction of the resurrection in Mark xiv.
28. Jesus there promises His disciples that He will "go before them" into Galilee.
That cannot mean that He will go alone into Galilee before them, and that they
shall there meet with Him, their risen Master; what He contemplates is that He
shall return with them, at their head, from Jerusalem to Galilee. Was it that the
manifestation of the Son of Man and of the Judgment should take place there? So
much is clear: the saying, far from directing the disciples to go away to Galilee,
chains them to Jerusalem, there to await Him who should lead them home. It
should not therefore be claimed as supporting the tradition of the Galilaean appearances.
<P>
We find it "corrected" by the saying of the "young man" at the grave, who
gays to the women, "Go, tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before you into
Galilee. There shall ye see Him as He said unto you."
<P>
Here then the idea of following in point of time is foisted upon the words "he
goeth before you," whereas in the original the word has a purely local sense,
corresponding to the <font face="Symbol">cai hn proagwn autouV o IhsouV</font> in Mark x. 32.
<P>
But the correction is itself meaningless since the visions took place in Jerusalem.
We have therefore in this passage a more detailed indication of the way in which
Jesus thought of the events subsequent to His Resurrection. The interpretation of
this unfulfilled saying is, however, wholly impossible for us: it was net less so for
the earliest tradition, as is shown by the attempt to give it a meaning by the "correction."
<P>
<center>389</center>
<P>
at Jerusalem there is no word of that. This thought disappears once for
all.
<P>
In the secret of His passion which Jesus reveals to the disciples at
Caesarea Philippi the pre-Messianic tribulation is for others set aside,
abolished, concentrated upon Himself alone, and that in the form that
they are fulfilled in His own passion and death at Jerusalem. That was
the new conviction that had dawned upon Him. He must suffer for others
. . . that the Kingdom might come.
<P>
This change was due to the non-fulfillment of the promises made in
the discourse at the sending forth of the Twelve. He had thought then to
let loose the final tribulation and so compel the coming of the Kingdom.
And the cataclysm had not occurred. He had expected it also after the
return of the disciples. In Bethsaida, in speaking to the multitude which
He had consecrated by the foretaste of the Messianic feast, as also to
the disciples at the time of their mission. He had turned their thoughts
to things to come and had adjured them to be prepared to suffer with
Him, to give up their lives, not to be ashamed of Him in His humiliation,
since otherwise the Son of Man would be ashamed of them when
He came in glory (Mark viii. 34-ix. 1) [1]
<P>
In leaving Galilee He abandoned the hope that the final tribulation
would begin of itself. If it delays, that means that there is still something
to be done, and yet another of the violent must lay violent hands
upon the Kingdom of God. The movement of repentance had not been
sufficient. When, in accordance with His commission, by sending forth
the disciples with their message, he hurled the fire-brand which should
kindle the fiery trials of the Last Time, the flame went out. He had not
succeeded in sending the sword on earth and stirring up the conflict.
And until the time of trial had come, the coming of the Kingdom and
His own manifestation as Son of Man were impossible.
<P>
That meant-not that the Kingdom was not near at hand-but that
God had appointed otherwise in regard to the time of trial. He had heard
the Lord's Prayer in which Jesus and His followers prayed for the coming of the Kingdom-and at the same time, for deliverance from the
<font face="Symbol>peirasmoV</font>. The time of trial was not come; therefore God in His mercy
and omnipotence had eliminated it from the series of eschatological
events, and appointed to Him whose commission had been to bring it
about, instead to accomplish it in His own person. As He who was to
rule over the members of the Kingdom in the future age. He was ap-
<P>
[1] Here it is evident also from the form taken by the prophecy of the sufferings
that the section Mark viii. 34 ff. cannot possibly come after the revelation at
Caesarea Philippi, since in it, it is the thought of the general sufferings which is
implied. For the same reason the predictions of suffering and tribulation in the
Synoptic Apocalypse in Mark xiii. cannot be derived from Jesus.
<P>

<P>
pointed to serve them in the present, to give His life for them, the
many (Mark x. 45 and xiv. 24), and to make in His own blood the atonement
which they would have had to render in the tribulation.
<P>
The Kingdom could not come until the debt which weighed upon the
world was discharged. Until then, not only the now living believers,
but the chosen of all generations since the beginning of the world wait
for their manifestation in glory-Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the
countless unknown who should come from the East and from the West
to sit at tables with them at the Messianic feast (Matt. viii. 11). The
enigmatic <font face="Symbol">polloi</font> for whom Jesus dies are those predestined to the Kingdom, since His death must at last compel the Coming of the Kingdom. [1]
<P>
This thought Jesus found in the prophecies of Isaiah, which spoke
of the suffering Servant of the Lord. The mysterious description of
Him who in His humiliation was despised and misunderstood, who,
nevertheless bears the guilt of others and afterwards is made manifest
in what He has done for them, points, He feels, to Himself.
<P>
And since He found it there set down that He must suffer unrecognised, and that those for whom He suffered should doubt Him, His
suffering should, nay must, remain a mystery. In that case those who
doubted Him would not bring condemnation [1] upon themselves. He no
<P>
[1] Weisse and Bruno Bauer had long ago pointed out how curious it was that
Jesus in the sayings about His sufferings spoke of "many" instead of speaking of
"His own" or "the believers." Weisse found in the words the thought that Jesus
died for the nation as a whole; Bruno Bauer that the "for many" in the words of
Jesus was derived from the view of the later theology of the Christian community.
This explanation is certainly wrong, for so soon as the words of Jesus come into any
kind of contact with early theology the "many" disappear to give place to the
"believers." In the Pauline words of institution the form is: My body for you
(1 Cor. xi. 24).
<P>
Johannes Weiss follows in the footsteps of Weisse when he interprets the "many"
as the nation (Die Predigt Jesu vom Reiche Gottes, 2nd ed., 1909, p. 201). He gives
however, quite a false turn to this interpretation by arguing that the "many" cannot
include the disciples, since they "who in faith and penitence have received the tidings of the Kingdom of God no longer need a special means of deliverance such as
this." They are the chosen, to them the Kingdom is assured. But a ransom, a special
means of salvation, is needful for the mass of the people, who in their blindness
have incurred the guilt of rejecting the Messiah. For this grave sin, which is,
nevertheless, to some extent excused as due to ignorance, there is a unique atoning
sacrifice, the death of the Messiah.
<P>
This theory is based on a distinction of which there is no hint in the teaching ot
Jesus; and it takes no account of the predestinarianism which is an integral part ot
eschatology, and which, in fact, dominated the thoughts of Jesus. The Lord is
conscious that He dies only for the elect. For others His death can avail nothing,
not even their own repentance. Moreover, He does not die in orcier that this one
or that one may come into the Kingdom of God; He provides the atonement in
order that the Kingdom itself may come. Until the Kingdom comes even the elect
cannot possess it.
<P>
<center>391</center>
<P>
longer needs to adjure them for their own sakes to be faithful to Him
and to stand by Him even amid reproach and humiliation; He can
calmly predict to His disciples that they shall all be offended in Him
and shall flee (Mark xiv. 26, 27); He can tell Peter, who boasts that he
will die with Him, that before the dawn he shall deny Him thrice
(Mark xiv. 29-31); all that is so set down in the Scripture. They must
doubt Him. But now they shall not lose their blessedness, for He bears
all sins and transgressions. That, too, is buried in the atonement which
He offers.
<P>
Therefore, also, there is no need for them to understand His secret.
He spoke of it to them without any explanation. It is sufficient that they
should know why He goes up to Jerusalem. They, on their part, are
thinking only of the coming transformation of all things, as their conversation shows. The prospect which He has opened up to them is clear
enough; the only thing that they do not understand is why He must
first die at Jerusalem. The first time that Peter ventured to speak to
Him about it, He had turned on him w^h cruel harshness, had almost
cursed him (Mark viii. 32, 33) ; from that time forward they no longer
dared to ask Him anything about it. The new thought of His own passion has its basis therefore in the authority with which Jesus was armed
to bring about the beginning of the final tribulation. Ethically regarded,
His taking the suffering upon Himself is an act of mercy and compassion
towards those who would otherwise have had to bear these tribulations,
and perhaps would not have stood the test. Historically regarded, the
thought of His sufferings involves the same lofty treatment both of history and eschatology as was manifested in the identification of the
Baptist with Elias. For now He identifies His condemnation and execution, which are to take place on natural lines, with the predicted pre-Messianic tribulations. This imperious forcing of eschatology into
history is also its destruction; its assertion and abandonment at the
same time.
<P>
Towards Passover, therefore, Jesus sets out for Jerusalem, solely in
order to die there. [1] "It is," says Wrede, "beyond question the opinion
of Mark that Jesus went to Jerusalem because He had decided to die;
that is obvious even from the details of the story." It is therefore a mistake to speak of Jesus as "teaching" in Jerusalem. He has no intention
of doing so. As a prophet He foretells in veiled parabolic form the
offence which must come (Mark xii. 1-12), exhorts men to watch for
the Parousia, pictures the nature of the judgment which the Son of
<P>
[1] One might use it as a principle of division by which to classify the lives of
Jesus, whether they make Him go to Jerusalem to work or to die. Here as in so
many other places Weisse's clearness of perception is surprising. Jesus' journey was
according to him a pilgrimage to death, not to the Passover.
<P>
<center>392</center>
<P>
Man shall hold, and, for the rest, thinks only how He can so provoke
the Pharisees and the rulers that they will be compelled to get rid of
Him. That is why He violently cleanses the Temple, and attacks the
Pharisees, in the presence of the people, with passionate invective.
<P>
From the revelation at Caesarea Philippi onward, all that belongs to
the history of Jesus, in the strict sense, are the events which lead up to
His death; or, to put it more accurately, the events in which He Himself is the sole actor. The other things which happen, the questions
which are laid before Him for decision, the episodic incidents which
occur in those days, have nothing to do with the real "Life of Jesus,"
since they contribute nothing to the decisive issue, but merely form
the anecdotic fringes of the real outward and inward event, the deliberate
bringing down of death upon Himself.
<P>
It is in truth surprising that He succeeded in transforming into history
this resolve which had its roots in dogma, and really dying alone. Is it
not almost unintelligible that His disciples were not involved in His
fate? Not even the disciple who smote with the sword was arrested
along with Him (Mark xiv. 47); Peter, recognised in the courtyard of
the High Priest's house as one who had been with Jesus the Nazarene, is
allowed to go free.
<P>
For a moment indeed, Jesus believes that the "three" are destined to
share His fate, not from any outward necessity, but because they had
professed themselves able to suffer the last extremities with Him. The
sons of Zebedee, when He asked them whether, in order to sit at His
right hand and His left, they are prepared to drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism, had declared that they were, and thereupon He
had predicted that they should do so (Mark x. 38, 39). Peter again had
that very night, in spite of the warning of Jesus, sworn that he would
go even unto death with Him (Mark xiv. 30, 31). Hence He is conscious
of a higher possibility that these three are to go through the trial with
Him. He takes them with Him to Gethsemane and bids them remain near
Him and watch with Him. And since they do not perceive the danger
of the hour. He adjures them to watch and pray. They are to pray that
they may not have to pass through the trial (<font face="Symbol">ina mh elqhte eiV peirasmon</font>)
since, though the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak. Amid His own sore
distress He is anxious about them and their capacity to share His trial
as they had declared their willingness to do. [1]
<P>
Here also it is once more made clear that for Jesus the necessity of
His death is grounded in dogma, not in external historical facts. Above
the dogmatic eschatological necessity, however, there stands the omnipotence
of God, which is bound by no limitations. As Jesus in the Lord's
<P>
[1] "That ye enter not into temptation" is the content of the prayer that they are
to offer while watching with Him.
<P>
<center>393</center>
<P>
Prayer had taught His followers to pray for deliverance from the
<font face="Symbol">peirasmoV</font>, and as in His fears for the three He bids them pray for the
same thing, so now He Himself prays for deliverance, even in this last
moment when He knows that the armed band which is coming to arrest
Him is already on the way. Literal history does not exist for Him, only
the will of God; and this is exalted even above eschatological necessity.
<P>
But how did this exact agreement between the fate of Jesus and His
predictions come about? Why did the authorities strike at Him only,
not at His whole following, not even at the disciples?
<P>
He was arrested and condemned on account of His Messianic claims.
But how did the High Priest know that Jesus claimed to be the Messiah?
And why does he put the accusation as a direct question without calling
witnesses in support of it? Why was the attempt first made to bring up
a saying about the Temple which could be interpreted as blasphemy in
order to condemn Him on this ground (Mark xiv. 57-59)? Before that
again, as is evident from Mark's account, they had brought up a whole
crowd of witnesses in the hope of securing evidence sufficient to justify
His condemnation; and the attempt had not succeeded.
<P>
It was only after all these attempts had failed that the High Priest
brought his accusation concerning the Messianic claim, and he did so
without citing the three necessary witnesses. Why so? Because he had
not got them. The condemnation of Jesus depended on His own admission. That was why they had endeavoured to convict Him upon other charges. [1]
<P>
This wholly unintelligible feature of the trial confirms what is evident
also from the discourses and attitude of Jesus at Jerusalem, viz. that He
had not been held by the multitude to be the Messiah, that the idea of
His making such claims had not for a moment occurred to them-lay
in fact for them quite beyond the range of possibility. Therefore He
cannot have made a Messianic entry.
<P>
According to Havet, Brandt, Wellhausen, Dalman, and Wrede the
ovation at the entry had no Messianic character whatever. It is wholly
mistaken, as Wrede quite rightly remarks, to represent matters as if the
Messianic ovation was forced upon Jesus-that He accepted it with
inner repugnance and in silent passivity. For that would involve the
supposition that the people had for a moment regarded Him as Mes-
<P>
[1] As long ago as 1880, H. W. Bleby (The Trial of Jesus considered as a Judicial
Act) had emphasised this circumstance as significant. The injustice in the trial of
Jesus consisted, according to him, in the fact that He was condemned on His own
admission without any witnesses being called. Dalman, it is true, will not admit
that this technical error was very serious.
<P>
But the really important point is not whether the condemnation was legal or not;
it is the significant fact that the High Priest called no witnesses. Why did he not
call any? This question was obscured by Bleby and Dalman by other problems.
<P>
<center>394</center>
<P>
siah and then afterwards had shown themselves as completely without
any suspicion of His Messiahship as though they had in the interval
drunk of the waters of Lethe. The exact opposite is true: Jesus Himself
made the preparations for the Messianic entry. Its Messianic features
were due to His arrangements. He made a point of riding upon the ass,
not because He was weary, but because He desired that the Messianic
prophecy of Zech. ix. 9 should be secretly fulfilled.
<P>
The entry is therefore a Messianic act on the part of Jesus, an action
in which His consciousness of His office breaks through, as it did at
the sending forth of the disciples, in the explanation that the Baptist
was Elias, and in the feeding of the multitude. But others can have had
no suspicion of the Messianic significance of that which was going on
before their eyes. The entry into Jerusalem was therefore Messianic for
Jesus, but not Messianic for the people.
<P>
But what was He for the people? Here Wrede's theory that He was
a teacher again refutes itself. In the triumphal entry there is more than
the ovation offered to a teacher. The jubilations have reference to "Him
who is to come"; it is to Him that the acclamations are offered and because of Him that the people rejoice in the nearness of the Kingdom,
as in Mark, the cries of jubilation show; for here, as Dalman rightly
remarks, there is actually no mention of the Messiah.
<P>
Jesus therefore made His entry into Jerusalem as the Prophet, as
Elias. That is confirmed by Matthew (xxi. 11), although Matthew gives
a Messianic colouring to the entry itself by bringing in the acclamation
in which He was designated the Son of David, just as, conversely, he
reports the Baptist's question rightly, and introduces it wrongly, by
making the Baptist hear of the "works of the Christ."
<P>
Was Mark conscious, one wonders, that it was not a Messianic entry
that he was reporting? We do not know. It is not inherently impossible
that, as Wrede asserts, "he had no real view concerning the historical
life of Jesus," did not know whether Jesus was recognised as Messiah,
and took no interest in the question from an historical point of view.
Fortunately for us! For that is why he simply hands on tradition and
does not write a Life of Jesus.
<P>
The Marcan hypothesis went astray in conceiving this Gospel as a
Life of Jesus written with either complete or partial historical consciousness, and interpreting it on these lines, on the sole ground that it only
brings in the name Son of Man twice prior to the incident at Caesarea
Philippi. The Life of Jesus cannot be arrived at by following the arrangement of a single Gospel, but only on the basis of the tradition which
is preserved more or less faithfully in the earliest pair of Synoptic
Gospels.
<P>
Questions of literary priority, indeed literary questions in general,
have in the last resort, as Keim remarked long ago, nothing to do with
<P>
<center>397</center>
<P>
the gaining of a clear idea of the course of events, since the Evangelists
had not themselves a clear idea of it before their minds; it can only be
arrived at hypothetically by an experimental reconstruction based on
the necessary inner connexion of the incidents.
<P>
But who could possibly have had in early times a clear conception
of the Life of Jesus? Even its most critical moments were totally unintelligible to the disciples who had themselves shared in the experiences,
and who were the only sources for the tradition. They were simply swept
through these events by the momentum of the purpose of Jesus. That
is why the tradition is incoherent. The reality had been incoherent too,
since it was only the secret Messianic self-consciousness of Jesus which
created alike the events and their connexion. Every Life of Jesus remains
therefore a reconstruction on the basis of a more or less accurate insight into the nature of the dynamic self-consciousness of Jesus which
created the history.
<P>
The people, whatever Mark may have thought, did not offer Jesus
a Messianic ovation at all; it was He who, in the conviction that they
were wholly unable to recognise it, played with His Messianic self-consciousness before their eyes, just as He did at the time after tha
sending forth of the disciples, when, as now, He thought the end at hand.
It was in the same way, too, that He closed the invective against the
Pharisees with the words "I say unto you, ye shall see me no more until
ye shall say. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord" (Matt.
xxiii. 39). This saying implies His Parousia.
<P>
Similarly He is playing with His secret in that crucial question regarding the Messiahship in Mark xii. 35-37. There is no question of
dissociating the Davidic Sonship from the Messiahship. [1] He asks only
how can the Christ in virtue of His descent from David be, as his son,
inferior to David, and yet be addressed by David in the Psalm as his
Lord? The answer is; by reason of the metamorphosis and Parousia
in which natural relationships are abolished and the scion of David's
line who is the predestined Son of Man shall take possession of His
unique glory.
<P>
Far from rejecting the Davidic Sonship in this saying, Jesus, on the
contrary, presupposes His possession of it. That raises the question
whether He did not really during His lifetime regard Himself as a
descendant of David and whether He was not regarded as such. Paul,
who otherwise shows no interest in the earthly phase of the existence
of the Lord, certainly implies His descent from David.
<P>
The blind man at Jericho, too, cries out to the Nazarene prophet
as "Son of David" (Mark x. 47). But in doing so he does not mean to
<P>
[1] That would have been to utter a heresy which would alone have sufficed to
secure His condemnation. It would certainly have been brought up as a charge
against Him.
<P>
<center>396</center>
<P>
address Jesus as Messiah, for afterwards, when he is brought to Him he
simply calls Him "Rabbi" (Mark x. 51) And the people thought nothing
further about what he had said. When the expectant people bid him
keep silence they do not do so because the expression Son of David
offends them, but because his clamour annoys them. Jesus, however,
was struck by this cry, stood still and caused him, as he was standing
timidly behind the eager multitude, to be brought to Him. It is possible, of course, that this address is a mere mistake in the tradition, the
same tradition which unsuspectingly brought in the expression Son of
Man at the wrong place.
<P>
So much, however, is certain: the people were not made aware of the
Messiahship of Jesus by the cry of the blind man any more than by the
outcries of the demoniacs. The entry into Jerusalem was not a Messianic
ovation. All that history is concerned with is that this fact should be admitted on all hands. Except Jesus and the disciples, therefore, no one
knew the secret of His Messiahship even in those days at Jerusalem.
But the High Priest suddenly showed himself in possession of it. How?
Through the betrayal of Judas.
<P>
For a hundred and fifty years the question has been historically discussed why Judas betrayed his Master. That the main question for
history was what he betrayed was suspected by few and they touched
on it only in a timid kind of way-indeed the problems of the trial of
Jesus may be said to have been non-existent for criticism.
<P>
The traitorous act of Judas cannot have consisted in informing the
Sanhedrin where Jesus was to be found at a suitable place for an arrest.
They could have had that information more cheaply by causing Jesus
to be watched by spies. But Mark expressly says that Judas when he
betrayed Jesus did not yet know of a favourable opportunity for the
arrest, but was seeking such an opportunity. Mark xiv. 10, 11, "And
Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray
him unto them. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised
to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray
him."
<P>
In the betrayal, therefore, there were two points, a more general and
a more special: the general fact by which he gave Jesus into their power,
and the undertaking to let them know of the next opportunity when they
could arrest Him quietly, without publicity. The betrayal by which he
brought his Master to death, in consequence of which the rulers decided
upon the arrest, knowing that their cause was safe in any case, was the
betrayal of the Messianic secret. Jesus died because two of His disciples
had broken His command of silence: Peter when he made known the
secret of the Messiahship to the Twelve at Caesarea Philippi; Judas
Iscariot by communicating it to the High Priest. But the difficulty was
that Judas was the sole witness. Therefore the betrayal was useless so
<P>
<center>397</center>
<P>
far as the actual trial was concerned unless Jesus admitted the charge.
So they first tried to secure His condemnation on other grounds, and
only when these attempts broke down did the High Priest put, in the
form of a question, the charge in support of which he could have brought
no witnesses.
<P>
But Jesus immediately admitted it, and strengthened the admission
by an allusion to His Parousia in the near future as Son of Man.
<P>
The betrayal and the trial can only be rightly understood when it is
realised that the public knew nothing whatever of the secret of the Messiahship. [1]
<P>
It is the same in regard to the scene in the presence of Pilate. The
people on that morning knew nothing of the trial of Jesus, but came to
Pilate with the sole object of asking the release of a prisoner, as was
the custom at the feast (Mark xv. 6-8). The idea then occurs to Pilate,
who was just about to hand over, willingly enough, this troublesome
fellow and prophet to the priestly faction, to play off the people against
the priests and work on the multitude to petition for the release of
Jesus. In this way he would have secured himself on both sides. He
would have condemned Jesus to please the priests, and after condemning
Him would have released Him to please the people. The priests are
greatly embarrassed by the presence of the multitude. They had done
everything so quickly and quietly that they might well have hoped to
get Jesus crucified before any one knew what was happening or had
had time to wonder at His non-appearance in the Temple.
<P>
The priests therefore go among the people and induce them not to
agree to the Procurator's proposal. How? By telling them why He was
condemned, by revealing to them the Messianic secret. That makes Him
at once from a prophet worthy of honour into a deluded enthusiast and
blasphemer. That was the explanation of the "fickleness" of the Jeru-
salem mob which is always so eloquently described, without any evidence
for it except this single inexplicable case.
<P>
At midday of the same day-it was the 14th Nisan, and in the evening
the Paschal lamb would be eaten-Jesus cried aloud and expired. He had
chosen to remain fully conscious to the last.
<P>
[1] When it is assumed that the Messianic claims of Jesus were generally known
during those last days at Jerusalem there is a temptation to explain the absence of
witnesses in regard to them by supposing that they were too much a matter of
common knowledge to require evidence. But in that case why should the High
Priest not have fulfilled the prescribed formalities? Why make such efforts first to
establish a different charge? Thus the obscure and unintelligible procedure at the
trial of Jesus becomes in the end the clearest proof that the public knew nothing of
the Messiahship of Jesus.
