<P>
<center><h2>RESULTS</h2></center>
<P>
THOSE WHO ARE FOND OF TALKING ABOUT NEGATIVE THEOLOGY CAN FIND
their account here. There is nothing more negative than the result of
the critical study of the Life of Jesus.
<P>
The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah,
who preached the ethic of the Kingdom of God, who founded the Kingdom
of Heaven upon earth, and died to give His work its final consecration,
never had any existence. He is a figure designed by rationalism,
endowed with life by liberalism, and clothed by modern theology in an
historical garb.
<P>
This image has not been destroyed from without, it has fallen to
pieces, cleft and disintegrated by the concrete historical problems which
came to the surface one after another, and in spite of all the artifice, art,
artificiality, and violence which was applied to them, refused to be
planed down to fit the design on which the Jesus of the theology of the
last hundred and thirty years had been constructed, and were no sooner
covered over than they appeared again in a new form. The thoroughgoing sceptical and the thoroughgoing eschatological school have only
completed the work of destruction by linking the problems into a system
and so making an end of the <i>Divide et impera</i> of modern theology, which
undertook to solve each of them separately, that is, in a less difficult
form. Henceforth it is no longer permissible to take one problem out
of the series and dispose of it by itself, since the weight of the whole
hangs upon each.
<P>
Whatever the ultimate solution may be, the historical Jesus of whom
the criticism of the future, taking as its starting-point the problems
which have been recognised and admitted, will draw the portrait, can
never render modern theology the services which it claimed from its
own half-historical, half-modern, Jesus. He will be a Jesus, who was
Messiah, and lived as such, either on the ground of a literary fiction of
the earliest Evangelist, or on the ground of a purely eschatological
Messianic conception.
<P>
In either case, He will not be a Jesus Christ to whom the religion of
the present can ascribe, according to its long-cherished custom, its own
<P>
<center>399</center>
<P>
thoughts and ideas, as it did with the Jesus of its own making. Nor will
He be a figure which can be made by a popular historical treatment so
sympathetic and universally intelligible to the multitude. The historical
Jesus will be to our time a stranger and an enigma.
<P>
The study of the Life of Jesus has had a curious history. It set out in
quest of the historical Jesus, believing that when it had found Him it
could bring Him straight into our time as a Teacher and Saviour. It
loosed the bands by which He had been riveted for centuries to the
stony rocks of ecclesiastical doctrine, and rejoiced to see life and movement
coming into the figure once more, and the historical Jesus advancing,
as it seemed, to meet it. But He does not stay; He passes by our
time and returns to His own. What surprised and dismayed the theology
of the last forty years was that, despite all forced and arbitrary interpretations,
it could not keep Him in our time, but had to let Him go.
He returned to His own time, not owing to the application of any historical
ingenuity, but by the same inevitable necessity by which the
liberated pendulum returns to its original position.
<P>
The historical foundation of Christianity as built up by rationalistic,
by liberal, and by modern theology no longer exists; but that does not
mean that Christianity has lost its historical foundation. The work which
historical theology thought itself bound to carry out, and which fell to
pieces just as it was nearing completion, was only the brick facing of
the real immovable historical foundation which is independent of any
historical comfirmation or justification.
<P>
Jesus means something to our world because a mighty spiritual force
streams forth from Him and flows through our time also. This fact can
neither be shaken nor confirmed by any historical discovery. It is the
solid foundation of Christianity.
<P>
The mistake was to suppose that Jesus could come to mean more to
our time by entering into it as a man like ourselves. That is not possible.
First because such a Jesus never existed. Secondly because, although
historical knowledge can no doubt introduce greater clearness
into an existing spiritual life, it cannot call spiritual life into existence.
History can destroy the present; it can reconcile the present with the
past; can even to a certain extent transport the present into the past;
but to contribute to the making of the present is not given unto it.
<P>
But it is impossible to over-estimate the value of what German research
upon the Life of Jesus has accomplished. It is a uniquely great
expression of sincerity, one of the most significant events in the whole
mental and spiritual life of humanity. What has been done for the
religious life of the present and the immediate future by scholars such
as P. W. Schmidt, Bousset, Jiilicher, Weinel, Wernle—and their pupil
Frenssen—and the others who have been called to the task of bringing
<P>
<center>400</center>
<P>
to the knowledge of wider circles, in a form which is popular without
being superficial, the results of religious-historical study, only becomes
evident when one examines the literature and social culture of the Latin
nations, who have been scarcely if at all touched by the influence of
these thinkers.
<P>
And yet the time of doubt was bound to come. We modern theologians
are too proud of our historical method, too proud of our historical
Jesus, too confident in our belief in the spiritual gains which our historical
theology can bring to the world. The thought that we could build
up by the increase of historical knowledge a new and vigorous Christianity
and set free new spiritual forces, rules us like a fixed idea, and
prevents us from seeing that the task which we have grappled with and
in some measure discharged is only one of the intellectual preliminaries
of the great religious task. We thought that it was for us to lead our
time by a roundabout way through the historical Jesus, as we understood
Him, in order to bring it to the Jesus who is a spiritual power
in the present. This roundabout way has now been closed by genuine
history.
<P>
There was a danger of our thrusting ourselves between men and the
Gospels, and refusing to leave the individual man alone with the sayings
of Jesus.
<P>
There was a danger that we should offer them a Jesus who was too
small, because we had forced Him into conformity with our human
standards and human psychology. To see that, one need only read the
Lives of Jesus written since the 'sixties, and notice what they have made
of the great imperious sayings of the Lord, how they have weakened
down His imperative world-contemning demands upon individuals, that
He might not come into conflict with our ethical ideals, and might tune
His denial of the world to our acceptance of it. Many of the greatest
sayings are found lying in a corner like explosive shells from which the
charges have been removed. No small portion of elemental religious
power needed to be drawn off from His sayings to prevent them from
conflicting with our system of religious world-acceptance. We have made
Jesus hold another language with our time from that which He really
held.
<P>
In the process we ourselves have been enfeebled, and have robbed our
own thoughts of their vigour in order to project them back into history
and make them speak to us out of the past. It is nothing less than a misfortune
for modern theology that it mixes history with everything and
ends by being proud of the skill with which it finds its own thoughts—
even to its beggarly pseudo-metaphysic with which it has banished
genuine speculative metaphysic from the sphere of religion—in Jesus,
and represents Him as expressing them. It had almost deserved the re-
<P>
<center>401</center>
<P>
proach: "he who putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is
not fit for the Kingdom of God."
<P>
It was no small matter, therefore, that in the course of the critical
study of the Life of Jesus, after a resistance lasting for two generations,
during which first one expedient was tried and then another, theology
was forced by genuine history to begin to doubt the artificial history
with which it had thought to give new life to our Christianity, and to yield
to the facts, which, as Wrede strikingly said, are sometimes the most
radical critics of all. History will force it to find a way to transcend
history, and to fight for the lordship and rule of Jesus over this world
with weapons tempered in a different forge.
<P>
We are experiencing what Paul experienced. In the very moment
when we were coming nearer to the historical Jesus than men had ever
come before, and were already stretching out our hands to draw Him into
our own time, we have been obliged to give up the attempt and acknowledge
our failure in that paradoxical saying: "If we have known Christ
after the flesh yet henceforth know we Him no more." And further we
must be prepared to find that the historical knowledge of the personality
and life of Jesus will not be a help, but perhaps even an offence to religion.
<P>
But the truth is, it is not Jesus as historically known, but Jesus as
spiritually arisen within men, who is significant for our time and can
help it. Not the historical Jesus, but the spirit which goes forth from
Him and in the spirits of men strives for new influence and rule, is that
which overcomes the world.
<P>
It is not given to history to disengage that which is abiding and
eternal in the being of Jesus from the historical forms in which it
worked itself out, and to introduce it into our world as a living influence.
It has toiled in vain at this undertaking. As a water-plant is beautiful
so long as it is growing in the water, but once torn from its roots, withers
and becomes unrecognisable, so it is with the historical Jesus when He
is wrenched loose from the soil of eschatology, and the attempt is made
to conceive Him "historically" as a Being not subject to temporal conditions.
The abiding and eternal in Jesus is absolutely independent of
historical knowledge and can only be understood by contact with His
spirit which is still at work in the world. In proportion as we have the
Spirit of Jesus we have the true knowledge of Jesus.
<P>
Jesus as a concrete historical personality remains a stranger to our
time, but His spirit, which lies hidden in His words, is known in simplicity,
and its influence is direct. Every saying contains in its own way
the whole Jesus. The very strangeness and unconditionedness in which
He stands before us makes it easier for individuals to find their own
personal standpoint in regard to Him.
<P>
<center>402</center>
<P>
Men feared that to admit the claims of eschatology would abolish the
significance of His words for our time; and hence there was a feverish
eagerness to discover in them any elements that might be considered not
eschatologically conditioned. When any sayings were found of which
the wording did not absolutely imply an eschatological connexion there
was a great jubilation—these at least had been saved uninjured from the
coming <i>debacle</i>.
<P>
But in reality that which is eternal in the words of Jesus is due to
the very fact that they are based on an eschatological worldview, and
contain the expression of a mind for which the contemporary world with
its historical and social circumstances no longer had any existence.
They are appropriate, therefore, to any world, for in every world they
raise the man who dares to meet their challenge, and does not turn and
twist them into meaninglessness, above his world and his time, making
him inwardly free, so that he is fitted to be, in his own world and in his
own time, a simple channel of the power of Jesus.
<P>
Modern Lives of Jesus are too general in their scope. They aim at
influencing, by giving a complete impression of the life of Jesus, a whole
community. But the historical Jesus, as He is depicted in the Gospels,
influenced individuals by the individual word. They understood Him so
far as it was necessary for them to understand, without forming any
conception of His life as a whole, since this in its ultimate aims remained
a mystery even for the disciples.
<P>
Because it is thus preoccupied with the general, the universal, modern
theology is determined to find its world-accepting ethic in the teaching
of Jesus. Therein lies its weakness. The world affirms itself automatically;
the modern spirit cannot but affirm it. But why on that account abolish
the conflict between modern life, with the world-affirming spirit which
inspires it as a whole, and the world-negating spirit of Jesus? Why
spare the spirit of the individual man its appointed task of fighting its
way through the world-negation of Jesus, of contending with Him at
every step over the value of material and intellectual goods—a conflict
in which it may never rest? For the general, for the institutions of society,
the rule is: affirmation of the world, in conscious opposition to
the view of Jesus, on the ground that the world has affirmed itself! This
general affirmation of the world, however, if it is to be Christian, must
in the individual spirit be Christianised and transfigured by the personal
rejection of the world which is preached in the sayings of Jesus. It is
only by means of the tension thus set up that religious energy can be
communicated to our time. There was a danger that modern theology,
for the sake of peace, would deny the world-negation in the sayings of
Jesus, with which Protestantism was out of sympathy, and thus unstring
the bow and make Protestantism a mere sociological instead of a re-
<P>
<center>403</center>
<P>
ligious force. There was perhaps also a danger of inward insincerity in
the fact that it refused to admit to itself and others that it maintained
its affirmation of the world in opposition to the sayings of Jesus, simply
because it could not do otherwise.
<P>
For that reason it is a good thing that the true historical Jesus should
overthrow the modern Jesus, should rise up against the modern spirit
and send upon earth, not peace, but a sword. He was not teacher, not
a casuist; He was an imperious ruler. It was because He was so in His
inmost being that He could think of Himself as the Son of Man. That
was only the temporally conditioned expression of the fact that He was
an authoritative ruler. The names in which men expressed their recognition
of Him as such, Messiah, Son of Man, Son of God, have become
for us historical parables. We can find no designation which expresses
what He is for us.
<P>
He comes to us as One unknown, without a name, as of old, by the
lake-side, He came to those men who knew Him not. He speaks to us
the same word: "Follow thou me!" and sets us to the tasks which He
has to fulfil for our time. He commands. And to those who obey Him,
whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal Himself in the toils, the
conflicts, the sufferings which they shall pass through in His fellowship,
and, as an ineffable mystery, they shall learn in their own experience
Who He is.
