STRAUSS CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO HAVE DONE HIMSELF HONOUR BY CONTRIBUTIMG
a preface to the translation of Hennell's work, which is nothing
more than Venturini's "Non-miraculous History of the Great Prophet
of Nazareth" tricked out with a fantastic paraphernalia of learning. [1]
<P>
[1] Hennell, a London merchant, withdrew himself from his business pursuits for
two years in order to make the preparatory studies for this Life of Jesus. [He is best
known as a friend of George Eliot, who was greatly interested and influenced by the
"Inquiry."—TRANSLATOR.] To the same category as Hennell's work belongs the
<i>Vohlgeprilfte Darstellung des Lebens Jesu</i>. (An Account of the Life of Jesus based
on the closest Examination) of the Heidelberg mathematician, Karl von Langsdorf.
Mannheim, 1831. Supplement, with preface to a future second edition, 1833.
<P>
<center>162</center>
<P>
The two series of "Important Disclosures" also are really "conveyed"
with no particular ability from that classic romance of the Life of Jesus,
but that did not prevent their making something of a sensation at the
time when they appeared. [1] Jesus, according to his narrative, was the
son of a member of the Essene Order. The child was watched over by
the Order and prepared for His future mission. He entered on His public ministry as a tool of the Essenes, who after the crucifixion took Him
down from the cross and resuscitated Him.
<P>
These "Disclosures" only preserve the more external features of
Venturini's representation. His Life of Jesus had been more than a mere
romance, it had been an imaginative solution of problems which he
had intuitively perceived. It may be regarded as the Forerunner of
rationalistic criticism. The problems which Venturini had intuitively
perceived were not solved either by the rationalists, or by Strauss, or
by Weisse. These writers had not succeeded in providing that of which
Venturini had dreamed—a living purposeful connexion between the
events of the life of Jesus—or in explaining His Person and Work as
having a relation, either positive or negative, to the circumstances of
Late Judaism. Venturini's plan, however fantastic, connects the life of
Jesus with Jewish history and contemporary thought much more closely
than any other Life of Jesus, for that connexion is of course vital to
the plot of the romance. In Weisse's "Gospel History" criticism had
deliberately renounced the attempt to explain Jesus directly from Judaism, finding itself unable to establish any connexion between His teach-
ings and contemporary Jewish ideas. The way was therefore once more
open to the imagination. Accordingly several imaginative Lives preluded a new era in the study of the subject, in so far as they endeavoured
to understand Jesus on the basis of purely Jewish ideas, in some cases
as affirming these, in others as opposing them in favour of a more
spiritual conception. In Gfrorer, Richard von der Aim, and Noack,
begins the skirmishing preparatory to the future battle over escha-
tology. [2]
<P>
[1] Hase seems not to have recognised that the "Disclosures" were merely a plagiarism
from Venturini. He mentions them in connexion with Bruno Bauer and appears
to make him responsible for inspiring them; at least that is suggested by his formula
of transition when he says: "It was primarily to him that the frivolous apocryphal
hypotheses attached themselves." This is quite inaccurate. The anonymous epitomist
of Venturini had nothing to do with Bauer, and had probably not read a line of his
work. Venturini, whom he had read, he does not name.
<P>
[2] One of the most ingenious of the followers of Venturini was the French Jew
Salvator. In his <i>Jesus-Christ et sa doctrine</i> (Paris, 2 vols., 1838), he seeks to prove
that Jesus was the last representative of a mysticism which, drawing its nutriment
from the other Oriental religions, was to be traced among the Jews from the time
of Solomon onwards. In Jesus this mysticism allied itself with Messianic enthusiasm.
<P>
After He had lost consciousness upon the cross He was succoured by Joseph of
Arimathea and Pilate's wife contrary to His own expectation and purpose. He ended
His days among the Essenes.
<P>
Salvator looks to a spiritualised mystical Mosaism as destined to be the successful
rival of Christianity.
<P>
<center>163</center>
<P>
August Friedrich Gfrorer, born in 1803 at Calw, was "Repetent" at
the Tubingen theological seminary at the time when Strauss was studying there. After being curate at the principal church in Stuttgart for a
year he gave up, in 1830, the clerical profession in order to devote
himself wholly to his clerical studies.
<P>
By that time he had abandoned Christianity. In the preface to the
first edition of the first volume of his work, he describes Christianity
as a system which now only maintains itself by the force of custom,
after having commended itself to antiquity "by the hope of the mystic
Kingdom of the future world and having ruled the middle ages by the
fear of the same future." By enunciating this view he has made an end,
he thinks, of all high-flying Hegelian ideas, and being thus freed from
all speculative prejudices he feels himself in a position to approach his
task from a purely historical standpoint, with a view to showing how
much of Christianity is the creation of one exceptional Personality, and
how much belongs to the time in which it arose. In the first volume he
describes how the transformation of Jewish theology in Alexandria re-
acted upon Palestinian theology, and how it came to its climax in Philo.
The great Alexandrian anticipated, according to Gfrorer, the ideas of
Paul. His "Therapeutae" are identical with the Essenes. At the same
period Judaea was kept in a ferment by a series of risings, to all of
which the incentive was found in Messianic expectations. Then Jesus
appeared. The three points to be investigated in His history are: what
end He had in view; why He died; and what modifications His work
underwent at the hands of the Apostles.
<P>
The second volume, entitled "The Sacred Legend," does not, however, carry out this plan. The works of Strauss and Weisse necessitated
a new method of treatment. The fame of Strauss's achievement stirred
Gfrorer to emulation, and Weisse, with his priority of Mark and rejection of John, must be refuted. The work is therefore almost a polemic
against Weisse for his "want of historic sense," and ends in setting up
views which had not entered into Gfrorer's mind at the time when he
wrote his first volume.
<P>
The statements of Papias regarding the Synoptists, which Weisse followed, are not deserving of credence. For a whole generation and more
the tradition about Jesus had passed from mouth to mouth, and it had
absorbed much that was legendary. Luke was the first—as his preface
shows—who checked that process, and undertook to separate what was
<P>
<center>164</center>
<P>
genuine from what was not. He is the most trustworthy of the Evangelists, for he keeps closely to his sources and adds nothing of his own,
in contrast with Matthew who, writing at a later date, used sources of
less value and invented matter of his own, which Gfrorer finds especially in the story of the passion in this Gospel. The lateness of Matthew
is also evident from his tendency to carry over the Old Testament into
the New. In Luke, on the other hand, the sources are so conscientiously
treated that Gfrorer finds no difficulty in analysing the narrative into its
component parts, especially as he always has a purely instinctive feeling "whenever a different wind begins to blow."
<P>
Both Gospels, however, were written long after the destruction of the
holy city, since they do not draw their material from the Jerusalem
tradition, but "from the Christian legends which had grown up in the
neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias," and in consequence "mistakenly
transferred the scene of Jesus' ministry to Galilee." For this reason it
is not surprising "that even down into the second century many Christians had doubts about the truth of the Synoptics and ventured to express their doubts." Such doubts only ceased when the Church became
firmly established and began to use its authority to suppress the objections of individuals. Mark is the earliest witness to doubts within
the primitive Christian community regarding the credibility of his predecessors. Luke and Matthew are for him not yet sacred books; he desires
to reconcile their inconsistencies, and at the same time to produce "a
Gospel composed of materials of which the authenticity could be maintained even against the doubters." For this reason he omits most of
the discourses, ignores the birth-story, and of the miracles retains only
those which were most deeply embedded in the tradition. His Gospel
was probably produced between 110 and 120. The "non-genuine" conclusion was a later addition, but by the Evangelist himself. Thus Mark
proves that the Synoptists contain legendary matter even though they
are separated from the events which they relate only by a generation
and a half, or at most two generations. To show that there is nothing
strange in this, Gfrorer gives a long catalogue of miracles found in historians who were contemporaries of the events which they describe, and
in some cases were concerned in them—in this connexion Cortez affords
him a rich storehouse of material. On the other hand, all objections
against the genuineness of the Fourth Gospel collapse miserably. It is
true that, like the others, it offers no historically accurate report of the
discourses of Jesus. It pictures Him as the Logos-Christ and makes
Him speak in this character; which Jesus certainly did not do. Inadvertently the author makes John the Baptist speak in the same way.
That does not matter, however, for the historical conditions are rightly
represented; rightly, because Jerusalem was the scene of the greater
<P>
<center>165</center>
<P>
part of the ministry, and the five Johannine miracles are to be retained.
The healing of the nobleman's son, that of the lame man at the pool
of Bethesda, and that of the man blind from birth happened just as
they are told. The story of the miracle at Cana rests on a misunderstanding, for the wine which Jesus provided was really the wedding-gift
which He had brought with Him. In the raising of Lazarus a real case
of apparent death is combined with a polemical exaggeration of it, the
restoration to life becoming, in the course of controversy with the Jews,
an actual resurrection. Having thus won free, dragging John along
with him, from the toils of the Hegelian denial of miracle—only, it is
true, by the aid of Venturini—and being prepared to explain the feeding of the multitude on the most commonplace rationalistic lines, he
may well boast that he has "driven the doubt concerning the Fourth
Gospel into a very small corner."
<P>
"The miserable era of negation," cries Gfrorer, "is now at an end;
affirmation begins. We are ascending the eastern mountains from which
the pure airs of heaven breathe upon the spirit. Our guide shall be
historical mathematics, a science which is as yet known to few, and has
not been applied by any one to the New Testament." This "mathematic"
of Gfrorer's consists in developing his whole argument out of a single
postulate. Let it be granted to him that all other claimants of the Messiahship—Gfrorer, in defiance of the evidence of Josephus, makes all
the leaders of revolt in Palestine claimants of the Messiahship—were
put to death by the Romans, whereas Jesus was crucified by His own
people: it follows that the Messiahship of Jesus was not political, but
spiritual. He had declared Himself to be in a certain sense the longed-for
Messiah, but in another sense He was not so. His preaching moved in
the sphere of Philonian ideas; although He did not as yet explicitly
apply the Logos doctrine, it was implicit in His thought, so that the
discourses of the Fourth Gospel have an essential truth. All Messianic
conceptions, the Kingdom of God, the judgment, the future world, are
sublimated into the spiritual region. The resurrection of the dead becomes a present eternal life. The saying in John v. 24, "He that heareth
my word, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath eternal life and cometh
not into judgment; but is passed from death into life," is the only
authentic part of that discourse. The reference which follows to the
coming judgment and the resurrection of the dead is a Jewish interpolation. Jesus did not believe that He Himself was to rise from the
dead. Nevertheless, the "resurrection" is historic; Joseph of Arimathea,
a member of the Essene Order, whose tool Jesus unconsciously was,
had bribed the Romans to make the crucifixion of Jesus only a pretence, and to crucify two others with Him in order to distract attention
from Him. After He was taken down from the cross, Joseph removed
<P>
<center>166</center>
<P>
Him to a tomb of his own which had been hewn out for the purpose
in the neighbourhood of the cross, and succeeded in resuscitating Him.
The Christian Church grew out of the Essene Order by giving a further
development to its ideas, and it is impossible to explain the organisation of the Church without taking account of the regulations of the Order.
The work closes with a rhapsody on the Church and its development
into the Papal system.
<P>
Gfrorer thus works into Venturini's plan a quantity of material
drawn from Philo. His first volume would have led one to expect a
more original and scientific result. But the author is one of those "epileptics of criticism" for whom criticism is not a natural and healthy
means of arriving at a result, but who, in consequence of the fits of
criticism to which they are subject, and which they even endeavour to
intensify, fall into a condition of exhaustion, in which the need for
some fixed point becomes so imperative that they create it for themselves by self-suggestion—as they previously did their criticism—and
then flatter themselves that they have really found it.
<P>
This need for a fixed point carried the former rival of Strauss into
Catholicism, for which his "General History of the Church" (1841-1846) already shows a strong admiration. After the appearance of this
work Gfrorer became Professor of History in the University of Freiburg. In 1848 he was active in the German Parliament in endeavouring
to promote a reunion of the Protestants with the Catholics. In 1853 he
went over to the Roman Church. His family had already gone over, at
Strassburg, during the revolutionary period. In the conflict of the church
with the Baden Government he vehemently supported the claims of the
Pope. He died in 1861.
<P>
Incomparably better and more thorough is the attempt to write a
Life of Jesus embodied in the "Theological Letters to the Cultured
Classes of the German Nation." Their writer takes Gfrorer's studies as
his starting-point, but instead of spiritualising unjustifiably he ventures
to conceive the Jewish world of thought in which Jesus lived in its simple
realism. He was the first to place the eschatology recognised by Strauss
and Reimarus in an historical setting—that of Venturini's plan—and
to write a Life of Jesus entirely governed by the idea of eschatology.
<P>
The author, Friedrich Wilhelm Ghillany, was born in 1807 at
Eriangen. His first studies were in theology. His rationalistic views,
however, compelled him to abandon the clerical profession. He became
librarian at Nuremberg in 1841 and engaged in controversial writing
of an anti-orthodox character, but distinguished himself also by historical work of outstanding merit. A year after the publication of the
"Theological Letters." which he issued under the pseudonym of Richard
<P>
<center>167</center>
<P>
von der Alm, he published a collection of "The Opinions of Heathen
and Christian Writers of the first Christian Centuries about Jesus
Christ" (1864), a work which gives evidence of a remarkable range of
reading. In 1855 he removed to Munich in the hope of obtaining a post
in the diplomatic service, but in spite of his solid acquirements he did
not succeed. No one would venture to appoint a man of such outspoken
anti-ecclesiastical views. He died in 1876.
<P>
As regards the question of the sources, Ghillany occupies very nearly
the Tubingen standpoint, except that he holds Matthew to be later than
Luke, and Mark to be extracted, not from these Gospels in their present
form, but from their sources. John is not authentic.
<P>
The worship offered to Jesus after His death by the Christian community is, according to Ghillany, not derived from pure Judaism, but
from a Judaism influenced by oriental religions. The influence of the
cult of Mithra, for example, is unmistakable. In it, as in Christianity,
we find the virgin-birth, the star, the wise men, the cross, and the resurrection. Were it not for the human sacrifice of the Mithra cult, the
idea which is operative in the Supper, of eating and drinking the flesh
and blood of the Son of Man, would be inexplicable.
<P>
The whole Eastern world was at that time impregnated with Gnostic
ideas, which centred in the revelation of the Divine in the human. In
this way there arose, for example, a Samaritan Gnosis, independent of
the Christian. Christianity itself is a species of Gnosis. In any case the
metaphysical conception of the Divine Sonship of Jesus is of secondary
origin. If He was in any sense the Son of God for the disciples, they can
only have thought of this sonship in a Gnostic fashion, and supposed
that the "highest angel," the Son of God, had taken up His abode in
Him.
<P>
John the Baptist had probably come forth from among the Essenes,
and he preached a spiritualised Kingdom of Heaven. He held himself
to be Elias. Jesus' aims were originally similar; He came forward "in
the cause of sound religious teaching for the people." He made no
claim to Davidic descent; that is to be credited to dogmatic theology.
Similarly Papias is wrong in ascribing to Jesus the crude eschatological
expectations implied in the saying about the miraculous vine in the
Messianic Kingdom.
<P>
It is certain, however, that Jesus held Himself to be Messiah and
expected the early coming of the Kingdom. His teaching is Rabbinic;
all His ideas have their source in contemporary Judaism, whose world
of thought we can reconstruct from the Rabbinic writings; for even if
these only became fixed at a later period, the thoughts on which they
are based were already current in the time of Jesus. Another source of
great importance is Justin's "Dialogue with the Jew Trypho."
<P>
<center>168</center>
<P>
The starting-point in interpreting the teaching of Jesus is the idea
of repentance. In the tractate "Sanhedrin" we find: "The set time of
the Messiah is already here; His coming depends now upon repentance
and good works. Rabbi Eleazer says, 'When the Jews repent they shall
be redeemed.'" The Targum of Jonathan observes, on Zech. x. 3, 4,1
"The Messiah is already born, but remains in concealment because of
the sins of the Hebrews." We find the same thoughts put into the
mouth of Trypho in Justin. In the same Targum of Jonathan, Isa. liii.
is interpreted with reference to the sufferings of the Messiah. Judaism,
therefore, was not unacquainted with the idea of a suffering Messiah.
He was not identified, however, with the heavenly Messiah of Daniel.
The Rabbis distinguished two Messiahs, one of Israel and one of Judah.
First the Messiah of the Kingdom of Israel, denominated the Son of
Joseph, was to come from Galilee to suffer death at the hands of the
Gentiles in order to make atonement for the sins of the Hebrew nation.
Only after that would the Messiah predicted by Daniel, the son of David,
of the tribe of Judah, appear in glory upon the clouds of heaven. Finally,
He also, after two-and-sixty weeks of years, should be taken away, since
the Messianic Kingdom, even as conceived by Paul, was only a temporary supernatural condition of the world.
<P>
The Messianic expectation, being directed to supernatural events,
had no political character, and one who knew Himself to be the Messiah
could never dream of using earthly means for the attainment of His
ends; He would expect all things to be brought about by the Divine intervention. In this respect Ghillany grasps clearly the character of the
eschatology of Jesus—more clearly than any one had ever done before.
<P>
The role of the Messiah, who prior to His supernatural manifestation
remains in concealment upon earth, is therefore passive. He who is
conscious of a Messianic vocation does not seek to found a Kingdom
among men. He waits with confidence. He issues forth from His passivity
with the sole purpose of making atonement, by vicarious suffering, for
the sins of the people, in order that it may be possible for God to bring
about the new condition of things. If, in spite of the repentance of the
people and the occurrence of the signs which pointed to its being at
hand, the coming of the Kingdom should be delayed, the man who is
conscious of a Messianic vocation must, by His death, compel the intervention of God. His vocation in this world is to die.
<P>
Brought within the lines of these reflections the Life of Jesus shapes
itself as follows.
<P>
Jesus was the tool of a mystical sect allied to the Essenes, the head of
which was doubtless that Joseph of Arimathea who makes so sudden
<P>
[1] The reference should be Micah iv. 8.—F. C. B.
<P>
<center>169</center>
<P>
and striking an appearance in the Gospel narrative. This party de-
sired to bring about the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven by mystical
means, whereas the mass of the people, led astray by the Pharisees,
thought to force on its coming by means of a rising. In the preacher
of a spiritual Kingdom of Heaven, who was resolved to go to death
for His cause, the mystical party discovered Messiah the son of Joseph,
and they recognised that His death was necessary to make possible the
coming of the heavenly Messiah predicted by Daniel. That Jesus Himself was the Messiah of Daniel, that He would immediately rise again
in order to ascend to His heavenly throne, and would come thence with
the hosts of heaven to establish the Kingdom of Heaven, these people
did not themselves believe. But they encouraged Him in this belief,
thinking that he would hardly commit Himself to a sacrificial death
from which there was to be no resurrection. It was left uncertain to
His mind whether Jehovah would be content with the repentance of the
people, in so far as it had taken place, as realising the necessary condition for the bringing in of the Kingdom of Heaven, or whether an
atonement by blood, offered by the death of Messiah the son of Joseph,
v/ould be needful. It had been explained to Him that when the calculated
year of grace arrived, He must go up to Jerusalem and endeavour to
rouse the Jews to Messianic enthusiasm in order to compel Jehovah to
come to their aid with His heavenly hosts. From the action of Jehovah
it could then be discovered whether the preaching of repentance and
baptism would suffice to make atonement for the people before God
or not. If Jehovah did not appear, a deeper atonement must be made;
Jesus must pay the penalty of death for the sins of the Jews, but on the
third day would rise again from the dead and ascend to the throne of
God and come again thence to found the Kingdom of Heaven. "Any
one can see," concludes Ghillany, "that our view affords a very natural
explanation of the anxiety of the disciples, the suspense of Jesus Himself, and the prayer, 'If it be possible let this cup pass from me.' "
<P>
"It was apparently only towards the close of His life that Jesus
revealed to the disciples the possibility that the Son of Man might have
to suffer and die before He could found the Messianic Kingdom."
<P>
With this possibility before Him, He came to Jerusalem and there
awaited the Divine intervention. Meanwhile Joseph of Arimathea lent
his aid towards securing His condemnation in the Sanhedrin. He must
die on the day of the Passover; on the day of the Preparation He must
be at hand and ready in Jerusalem. He held, with His disciples, a love-feast after the Essene custom, not a Paschal meal, and in doing so associated thoughts of His death with the breaking of bread and the
pouring out of the wine. "He did not lay upon His disciples any injunction to continue the celebration of a feast of this kind until the
<P>
<center>170</center>
<P>
time of His return, because He thought of His resurrection and His
heavenly glory as about to take place after three days. But when His
return was delayed the early Christians attached these sayings of His
about the bread and wine to their Essene love-feast, and explained this
common meal of the community as a commemoration of the Last Supper of Jesus and His disciples, a memorial Feast in honour of their
Saviour, the celebration of which must be continued until His coming."
<P>
When the armed band came to arrest Him, Jesus surrendered to His
fate. Pilate almost set Him free, holding Him to be a mere enthusiast
who placed His hopes only in the Divine intervention. Joseph of Arimathea, however, succeeded in averting this danger. "Even on the cross
lesus seems to have continued to hope for the Divine intervention, as
is evidenced by the cry, 'My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken
me?'" Joseph of Arimathea provided for His burial.
<P>
The belief in His resurrection rests upon the visions of the disciples, which are to be explained by their intense desire for the Parousia,
of which He had given them the promise. After setting their affairs in
order in Galilee they returned at the Feast of Pentecost to Jerusalem,
which they had left in alarm, in order there to await the Parousia in
company with other Galilaean believers.
<P>
The confession of faith of the primitive Christian community was
the simplest conceivable: Jesus the Messiah had come, not as a temporal
conqueror, but as the Son of Man foretold by Daniel, and had died
for the sins of the people. In other respects they were strict Jews, kept
the Law, and were constantly in the Temple. Only the community of
goods and the brotherhood-meal are of an Essene character.
<P>
"The Christianity of the original community in Jerusalem was thus
a mixture of Zealotism and Mysticism which did not include any wholly
new element, and even in its conception of the Messiah had nothing
peculiar to itself except the belief that the Son of Man predicted by
Daniel had already come in the person of Jesus of Nazareth . . . that
He was now enthroned at the right hand of God, and would again appear as the expected Son of Man upon the clouds of heaven according
to Daniel's prophecy." Jesus, therefore, had triumphed over the mystical
party who desired to make use of Him in the character of Messiah the
son of Joseph—their Messiah, the heavenly Son of Man, had not come.
Jesus, in virtue of what He had done, had taken His place both in
heaven and in earth.
<P>
How much of Venturini's plan is here retained? Only the "mystical
part" which serves the purpose of setting the action of the drama in motion. All the rest of it, the rationalistic part, has been transmuted into an
historical conception. Miracle and trickery, along with the stage-play
resurrection, have been purged away in the fires of Strauss's criticism.
<P>
<center>171</center>
<P>
There remains only a fundamental conception which has a certain
greatness—a brotherhood which looks for the coming of the Kingdom of
Heaven appoints one of its members to undergo as Messiah an atoning
death, that the coming of the Kingdom, for which the time is at hand,
may not be delayed. This brotherhood is the only fictitious element
in the whole construction—much as in the primitive steam-engine the
valves were still worked by hand while the rest of the machinery was
actuated by its own motive-power. So in this Life of Jesus the motive-power is drawn entirely from historical sources, and the want of an
automatic starting arrangement is a mere anachronism. Strike out the
superfluous role of Joseph of Arimathea, and the distinction of the two
Messiahs, which is not clear even in the Rabbis, and substitute the
simple hypothesis that Jesus, in the course of His Messianic vocation,
when He thinks the time for the coming of the Kingdom has arrived,
goes freely to Jerusalem, and, as it were, compels the secular power to
put Him to death, in order by this act of atonement to win for the
world the immediate coming of the Kingdom, and for Himself the glory
of the Son of Man—make these changes, and you have a life of Jesus
in which the motive-power is a purely historical force. It is impossible
to indicate briefly all the parts of which the seemingly complicated,
but in reality impressively simple, mechanism of this Life of Jesus is
composed. The conduct of Jesus, alike in its resolution and in its hesitation, becomes clear, and not less so that of the disciples. All far-fetched historical ingenuity is dispensed with. Jesus acts "because His
hour is come." This decisive placing of the Life of Jesus in the "last
time" (cf. 1 Peter i. 20 <font face="Symbol">fanerwqentoV de ep' escatwn twn cronwn di umaV</font>)
is an historical achievement without parallel. Not less so is the placing
of the thought of the passion in its proper eschatological setting as
an act of atonement. Where had the character and origin of the primitive
community ever been brought into such clear connexion with the death
of Jesus? Who had ever before so earnestly considered the problem
why the Christian community arose in Jerusalem and not in Galilee?
"But the solution is too simple, and, moreover, is not founded on a
severely scientific chain of reasoning, but on historical intuition and experiment, the simple experiment of introducing the Life of Jesus into
the Jewish eschatological world of thought"—so the theologians replied,
or so, at least, they might have replied if they had taken this curious
work seriously, if, indeed, they had read it at all. But how were they to
suspect that in a book which seemed to aim at founding a new Deistic
Church, and which went out with the Wolfenuttel Fragmentist into the
desert of the most barren natural religion, a valuable historical conception might be found? It is true that no one suspected at that time
that in the forgotten work of Reimarus there lay a dangerous historical
<P>
<center>172</center>
<P>
discovery, a kind of explosive material such as can only be collected by
those who stand free from every responsibility towards historical Christianity, who have abandoned every prejudice, in the good sense as well
as in the bad—and whose one desire in regard to the Gospel history is
to be "spirits that constantly deny." [1] Such thinkers, if they have historical gifts, destroy artifical history in the cause of true history and,
willing evil, do good—if it be admitted that the discovery of truth is
good. If this negative work is a good thing, the author of the "Letters
to the German People" performed a distinguished service, for his negation is radical. The new Church which was to be founded on this historic
overcoming of historic Christianity was to combine "only what was
according to reason in Judaism and Christianity." From Judaism it was
to take the belief in one sole, spiritual, perfect God; from Christianity
the requirement of brotherly love to all men. On the other hand, it was to
eliminate what was contrary to reason in each: from Judaism the ritual
system and the sacrifices; from Christianity the deification of Jesus
and the teaching of redemption through His blood. How comes so completely unhistorical a temperament to be combined with so historical
an intellect? His Jesus, after all, has no individuality; He is a mere
eschatological machine.
<P>
In accordance with the confession of faith of the new Church of which
Ghillany dreamed, the calendar of the Feasts is to be transformed as
follows:—
<P>
1. Feast of the Deity, the first and second of January.
<P>
2. Feast of the Dignity of Man and Brotherly Love, first and second of
April.
<P>
3. Feast of the Divine Blessing in Nature, first and second of July.
<P>
4. Feast of Immortality, first and second of October.
<P>
Apart from these eight Feast days, and the Sundays, all the other
days of the year are working days.
<P>
From the order of divine service we may note the following: "The
sermon, which should begin with instruction and exhortation and close
with consolation and encouragement, must not last longer than half an
hour."
<P>
The series of Lives of Jesus which combine criticism with fiction is
closed by Noack's Story of Jesus. A freethinker like Ghillany, but lacking the financial independence which a kindly fate had conferred upon
the latter, Noack led a life which may properly be described as a constant martyrdom, lightened only by his intense love of theological
studies, which nevertheless were responsible for all his troubles. Born
in 1819, of a clerical family in Hesse, he became in 1842 Pastor's as-
<P>
[1] "Ich bin der Geist, der stets verneint."—Mephistopheles in Faust.
<P>
<center>173</center>
<P>
sistant and teacher of religion at Worms in the Hessian Palatinate. The
Darmstadt reactionaries drove him out of this position in 1844 without
his having given any ground of offence. In 1849 he became "Repetent"
in Philosophy at the University of Giessen at a salary of four hundred
gulden. In 1855 he was promoted to be Professor Extraordinary without
having his salary raised. In 1870, at the age of 51, he was appointed
assistant at the University Library and received at the same time the
title of Ordinary Professor. He died in 1885. He was an extremely
prolific writer, always ingenious, and possessed of wide knowledge, but
he never did anything of real permanent value either in philosophy or
theology. He was not without critical acumen, but there was too much
of the poet in him; a critical discovery was an incitement to an
imaginative reconstruction of the history. In 1870-1871 he published,
after many preliminary studies, his chief work, "From the Jordan Uplands
to Golgotha; four books on the Gospel and the Gospels." [1] It
passed unnoticed. Attributing its failure to the excitement aroused by
the war, which ousted all other interests, he issued a revised edition in
1876 under the title "The History of Jesus, on the Basis of Free Historical Inquiry concerning the Gospel and the Gospels," [2] but with
hardly greater success.
<P>
And yet the fundamental critical ideas which can be detected beneath
this narrative, in spite of its having the form of fiction, give this work
a significance such as the contemporary Lives of Jesus which won the
applause of theologians did not possess. It is the only Life of Jesus
hitherto produced which is written consistently from the Johannine
point of view from beginning to end. Strauss had not, after all, in
Noack's opinion, conclusively shown the absolute incompatibility of
the Synoptics with the Fourth Gospel; neither he nor any other critic
had felt the full difficulty of the question why the Fourth Evangelist
should be at pains to invent the numerous journeys to the Feasts, seeing that the development of the Logos Christology did not necessarily
involve any alteration of the scene of the ministry; on the contrary, it
would, one might think, have been the first care of the Evangelist to
inweave his novel theory with the familiar tradition in order to avoid
discrediting his narrative in advance by his innovations. Noack's conclusion is that the inconsistency is not due to a single author; it is the
result of a long process of redaction in which various divergent tendencies have been at work. But as the Fourth Gospel is not the logical
terminus of the process of alteration, the only alternative is to place it
<P>
[1] <i>Aus der Jordanwiege nach Golgotha; vier Bucher fiber das Evangelium und die

<P>
[2] <i>Die Geschichte Jesu auf Grand freiw geschichtlicher Untersuchungen uber das

<P>
<center>174</center>
<P>
at the beginning. What we have to seek in it is the original Gospel from
which the process of transforming the tradition started.
<P>
There is also another line of argument based on the contradictions
in the Gospel tradition which leads to the hypothesis that we have to
do with redactions of the Gospels. Either Jesus was the Jewish Messiah
of the Synoptics, or a Son of God in the Greek, spiritual sense, whose
self-consciousness must be interpreted by means of the Logos doctrine:
He cannot have been both at the same time. But it is inconceivable that
a Jewish claimant of the Messiahship would have been left unmolested
up to the last, and have had virtually to force the authorities to put
him to death. On the other hand, if He were a simple enthusiast claiming
to be a Son of God, a man who lived only for his own "self-consciousness," He might from the beginning have taken up this attitude without being in any way molested, except by the scorn of men. In this respect also, therefore, the primitive Gospel which we can recover from
John has the advantage. It was only later that this "Son of God" became
the Jewish Messiah.
<P>
We arrive at the primitive Johannine writing when we cancel in the
Fourth Gospel all Jewish doctrine and all miracles. [1] Its date is the year
60 and it was composed by—Judas, the beloved disciple. This primitive
Gospel received little modification and still shows clearly "the wonderful reality of its history." It aims only at giving a section of Jesus'
history, a representation of His attitude of mind and spirit. With "simple
ingenuousness" it gives, "along with the kernel of the historical material of the Gospel, Jesus' thoughts about His own Person in the mysterious oracular sayings and deeply thoughtful and moving discourses
by which the Nazarene stirred rather than enlightened the world."
Events of a striking character were, however, absent from it. The feeding of the multitude was represented in it as effected by natural means.
It was a philanthropic feeding of a multitude which certainly did not
number thousands, the numbers are a later insertion; Jesus fed them
with bread and fish which He purchased from a "sutler-lad." The healing of the lame man at the pool of Bethesda was the unmasking of a
malingerer, whom the Lord exposed and ordered to depart. As He had
bidden him carry his bed, and it was on the Sabbath, this brought Him
into conflict with the authorities. His only "acts" were acts of self-revelation—mystical sayings which He threw out to the people. "The
problem which meets us in His history is in truth a psychological problem, how, namely. His exalted view of Himself came to be accepted as
the purest and highest truth—in His lifetime, it is true, only by a
limited circle of disciples, but after His departure by a constantly grow-
<P>
[1] For Noack's reconstruction of it see Book iii. pp. 196-225.
<P>
<center>175</center>
<P>
ing multitude of believing followers." The gospel of the beloved disciple Judas made its way quietly into the world, understood by few,
even as Jesus Himself had been understood by a few only.
<P>
About ten years later, according to Noack, appeared the original form
of Luke, which we can reconstruct from what is known of Marcion's
Luke. [1] This Evangelist is under Pauline influence, and writes with an
apologetic purpose. He desires to refute the calumny that Jesus was
"possessed of a devil," and he does this by making Him cast out devils.
It was in this way that miracle forced itself into the Gospel hbtory.
<P>
But this primitive Luke, as Noack reconstructs it by combining the
statements of the Fathers regarding Marcion's Gospel, knows nothing
of Jesus' journey to Jerusalem to die. This circumstance is of capital
importance to Noack, because in the course of his attempt to bring
the topography of the Fourth Gospel into harmony with that of the
Synoptics he had arrived at the remarkable result that the Johannine
Christ worked in Galilee, not in Judaea. On the basis of the <i>Onomasticon</i>
of Eusebius—which Noack, with the aid of topographical traditions
derived from the Crusaders and statements of Mohammedan writers,
interprets with a recklessness which is nothing short of criminal—Cana and Bethany (Bethabara) were not in the latitude of Jerusalem,
but "near the head-waters of the Jordan in the upper part of the Jordan
valley before it flows into the lake of Huleh. There, in Coele-Syria, on the
southern slope of Hermon, was the scene of John the Baptist's labours;
there Jesus began His ministry; thither He returned to die." "It is in the
Galilaean district which forms the scene of the Song of Solomon that the
reader of this book must be prepared to find the Golgotha of the cross."
That is the sentence with which Noack's account of the Life of Jesus
opens. This alludes to an idea which had already been worked out in his
"Studies on the Song of Solomon," [2] namely, that the mountain country
eurrounding the upper Jordan was the pre-exilic Judaea, and that the
"city of David" was situated there. The Jews on their return from exile
had at first endeavoured to rebuild that Coele-Syrian city of David
with the ruins of Solomon's Temple, but had been driven away from it
and had then taken the desperate resolution to build the temple of
Zerubbabel upon the high plateau lying far to the south of ancient Israel.
Ezra the Scribe interpolated the forgery on the ground of which this
site began to be accepted as the former city of David. Under the Syrian
oppression all remembrance of the ancient city of David entirely disappeared.
<P>
This fantastic edifice, in the construction of which the wildest etymolo-

<P>
<center>176</center>
<P>
gies play a part, is founded on the just recognition that a reconciliation
of John with the Synoptists can only be effected by transferring some
of the Johannine localities to the North; but this involves not only finding Bethany, Arimathea and the other places, but even the scene of
Jesus' death in this district. The brook Kedron conveniently becomes
the "brook of Cedars."
<P>
For fifty years the two earliest Evangelists, in spite of their poverty
of incident, sufficed for the needs of the Christians. The "fire of Jesus"
was fed chiefly by the Pauline Gospel. The original form of the Gospel
of Luke accordingly became the starting-point of the next stage of development. Thus arose the Gospel of Mark. Mark was not a native of
Palestine, but a man of Roman extraction living in Decapolis, who had
not the slightest knowledge of the localities in which the life of Jesus
was really passed. He undertook, about the year 130, "in the interest
of the new Christian settlement at Jerusalem in Hadrian's time, deliberately and consciously to transform the original plan of the Gospel
history and to represent the Lord as crucified at Jerusalem." The man
who from the year 132 onward, as Mark the Bishop, preached the word
of the Crucified to a Gentile Christian community amid the ruins of the
holy city, had previously, as Mark the Evangelist, taken care that a
prophet should not perish out of Jerusalem. In composing his Gospel
he made use, in addition to Luke, of a traditional source which he
found in Decapolis. He deliberately omitted the frequent journeys to
Jerusalem which were still found in the original Luke, and inserted
instead Jesus' journey to His death. He it was, also, who made the Nazarite into the Nazarene, laying the scene of Jesus' youth in Nazareth.
To the cures of demoniacs he added magical acts such as the feeding of
the multitude and the resurrection.
<P>
In Matthew, who appeared about 135, legend and fiction riot unchecked. In addition, Jewish parables and sayings are put into the
mouth of Jesus, whereas He really had nothing to do with the Jewish
world of ideas. For if anything is certain, it is that the moral maxims
of the latest Gospel are of a distinctively Jewish origin. About the middle
of the second century the originals of John and Luke underwent redaction. The redaction of the Logos Gospel was completed by the addition of the twenty-first chapter, the last redaction of Luke was perhaps
carried out by Justin Martyr, fresh from completing his "Dialogue with
Trypho"! Thus John and Luke are, in this final form, which is full of
contradictions, the latest Gospels, and the saying is fulfilled about the
first being last, and the last first.
<P>
Arbitrary as these suggestions are, there is nevertheless something
impressive in the attempt to explain the remarkable inconsistencies
which are found within the Gospel tradition by considerations relating
<P>
<center>177</center>
<P>
to its origin and development. Despite all his far-fetched ideas, Noack
really stands higher than some of his contemporaries who showed more
prudence in their theological enterprises, and about that time were
earning the applause of the faculty, and quieting the minds of the laity,
by performing once more the old conjuring trick—assisted by some new
feats of leger-demain—of harmonising John with the Synoptists in
such a way as to produce a Life of Jesus which could be turned to the
service of ecclesiastical theology.
<P>
The outline of the public Life of Jesus, as reconstructed by Noack,
is as follows. It lasted from early in the year 35 to the 14th Nisan of the
year 37, and began in the moment when Jesus revealed His consciousness of what He was. We do not know how long previously He had
cherished it in secret. It is certain that the Baptist helped to bring about
this revelation. This is the only part which he plays in the Gospel of
John. He was neither a preacher of repentance, nor an Elias, nor the
forerunner of Jesus, nor a mere signpost pointing to the Messiah, such
as the secondary tradition makes him out to be.
<P>
Similarly everything that is Messianic in the consciousness of Jesus
is secondary. The lines of His thought were guided by the Greek ideaa
about sons of God, for the soil of northern Galilee was saturated with
these ideas. Other sources which contributed something were the personification of the Divine Wisdom in the "Wisdom Literature" and some
of Philo's doctrines. Jesus became the son of God in an ecstatic trance!
Had not Philo recognised ecstasy as the last and highest means of rising
to union with the Divine?
<P>
Jesus' temperament, according to Noack, was pre-disposed to ecstasy,
since He was born out of wedlock. One who had this burden upon His
spirit may well have early taken refuge in His own thoughts, above the
clouds, in the presence of the God of His fathers. Assailed in a thousand
ways by the cruelty of the world, it would seem to Him as though His
Heavenly Father, though unseen, was stretching out to Him the arms
of consolation. Imagination, which ever mercifully lightens for men the
yoke of misery, charmed the fatherless child out of His earthly sufferings and put into His hand a coloured glass through which He saw the
world and life in a false light. Ecstatic enthusiasm had carried Him up
to the dizzy height of spiritual union with the Father in Heaven. A
hundred times He was cast down out of His dreams into the hard world
of reality, to experience once more His earthly distresses, but ever anew
he won His way by fasting, vigil, and prayer to the starry heaven of
ecstasy.
<P>
"Jesus," Noack explains, "had in thought projected Himself beyond
His earthly nativity and risen to the conception that His ego had been
in existence before this earthly body in which He stood visibly upon
<P>
<center>178</center>
<P>
the stage of the world. He felt that His ego had had being and life before He became incarnate upon earth. . . . This new conception of
Himself, born of His solitary musings, was incorporated into the very
substance of His natural personal ego. A new ego had superseded the
old natural, corporeally conditioned ego."
<P>
Ambition, too, came into play—the high ambition to do God a service
by the offering up of Himself. The passion of self-sacrifice is characteristic of a consciousness such as this. According to the document
which underlies the Johannine Gospel it was not in consequence of
outward events that Jesus took His resolve to die. "It was the later
Gospel tradition which exhibited His fate as an inevitable consequence
of His conflict with a world impervious to spiritual impression." In the
original Gospel that fate was freely embraced from the outset as belonging to the vocation of the Son of God. Only by the constant presence
of the thought of death could a life which for two years walked the
razor edge of such dizzy dreams have been preserved from falling. The
conviction, or perhaps rather the instinctive feeling, that the role of a
Son of God upon earth was not one to be maintained for decades was
the necessary counterpoise to the enthusiasm of Jesus' spirit. From the
first He was as much at home with the thought of death as with His
Heavenly Father.
<P>
This Son of Man—according to Noack's interpretation the title is
equivalent to Son of Hope—requires of the multitude that they shall
take His lofty dream for solid reality. "He revealed His message from
heaven to the world at the Paschal Feast of the year 35, by throwing
out a challenge to the Sadducaean hierarchy in Jerusalem." In the
time between John's removal from the scene and John's death, there
falls the visit of Jesus to Samaria and a sojourn in the neighbourhood
of His Galilaean home. At the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem in the
autumn of that year, the healing of the lame man at the pool of Bethesda
led to a breach with the Sabbatic regulations of the Pharisees. Later
on, in consequence of His generous feeding of the multitude in the
Gaulonite table-land, there is an attempt to make Him into a Messianic
King; which He, however, repudiates. At the time of the Passover in
Galilee in the year 36, in the synagogue at Capernaum, He tests the
spiritual insight of those who may, He hopes, be ripe for the higher
teaching concerning the Son of God made flesh, by the touchstone of
His mystical words about the bread of life. At the next Feast of Tabernacles, in the city of Zion, He makes a last desperate attempt to move
men's hearts by the parable of the Good Shepherd who is ready to lay
down His life for His sheep, the people of Israel.
<P>
But His adversaries are remorseless; they wound Him to the very
depths of His spirit by bringing to Him the woman taken in adultery,
<P>
<center>179</center>
<P>
and asking Him what they are to do with her. When this question was
sprung upon Him, He saw in a moment the public humiliation designed
by His adversaries. All eyes were turned upon Him, and for a few
moments the embarrassment of One who was usually so self-possessed
was patent to all. He stooped as though He desired to write with His
finger upon the ground. Was it shame at His dishonourable birth that
compelled Him thus to lower His gaze? But the painful silence of expectation among the spectators did not last long. His adversaries repeated their question. He raised His head and spoke the undying words:
"Let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone at her."
<P>
Incensed by His constant references to His heavenly Sonship, they
endeavour at last to stone Him. He flees from the Temple and takes
refuge in the Jordan uplands. His purpose is, at the next Passover, that
of the year 37, here in the mountains which were blessed as Joseph's
portion, to offer His atoning death as that of the true paschal lamb, and
with this act to quit the stage of the world's history. He remained in
hiding in order to avoid the risk of assassination by the emissaries of
the Pharisees. In Bethany He receives the mysterious visit of the Greeks,
who doubtless desired to tempt Him to raise the standard of revolt as a
claimant of the Messiahship, but He refuses to be shaken in His determination to die. The washing of the disciples' feet signifies their
baptism with water, that they might thereafter receive the baptism of
the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Judas, the disciple whom Jesus loved, who was a man of much resource, helped Him to avoid being arrested as a disturber of the peace
by arranging that the "betrayal" should take place on the evening before the Passover, in order that Jesus might die, as He desired, on the
day of the Passover. For this service of love he was, in the secondary
tradition, torn from the bosom of the Lord and branded as a traitor.
