<i>Karl Heinrich Venturini</i>. Natiirliche Geschichte des grossen Propheten von Naza-
reth. (A Non-supernatural History of the Great Prophet of Nazareth.) Bethlehem
(Copenhagen), 1st ed., 1800-1802; 2nd ed., 1806. 4 vols., embracing 2700 pp.
The work appeared anonymously. The description given below is based on the
2nd ed., which shows dependence, in some of the exegetical details, upon the
then recently published commentaries of Paulus.
<P>
IT IS STRANGE TO NOTICE HOW OFTEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR SUBJECT
a few imperfectly equipped free-lances have attacked and attempted to
carry the decisive positions before the ordered ranks of professional
theology have pushed their advance to these decisive points.
<P>
Thus, it was the fictitious "Lives" of Bahrdt and Venturini which, at
the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries, first
attempted to apply, with logical consistency, a non-supernatural interpretation to the miracle stories of the Gospel. Further, these writers were
the first who, instead of contenting themselves with the simple reproduction of the successive sections of the Gospel narrative, endeavoured to
grasp the inner connexion of cause and effect in the events and experiences of the life of Jesus. Since they found no such connexion indicated
in the Gospels, they had to supply it for themselves. The particular form
which their explanation takes — the hypothesis of a secret society of
which Jesus is the tool — is, it is true, rather a sorry makeshift. Yet, in a
sense, these Lives of Jesus, for all their colouring of fiction, are the first
<P>
<center>39</center>
<P>
which deserve the name. The rationalists, and even Paulus, confine themselves to describing the teaching of Jesus; Bahrdt and Venturini make a
bold attempt to paint the portrait of Jesus Himself. It is not surprising
that their portraiture is at once crude and fantastic, like the earliest attempts of art to represent the human figure in living movement.
<P>
Karl Friedrich Bahrdt was born in 1741 at Bischofswerda. Endowed
with brilliant abilities, he made, owing to a bad upbringing and an undisciplined sensuous nature, a miserable failure. After being first Catechist and afterwards Professor Extraordinary of Sacred Philology at
Leipzig, he was, in 1766, requested to resign on account of scandalous
life. After various adventures, and after holding for a time a professorship at Giessen, he received under Frederick's minister Zedlitz authorisation to lecture at Halle. There he lectured to nearly nine hundred students
who were attracted by his inspiring eloquence. The government upheld
him, in spite of his serious failings, with the double motive of annoying
the faculty and maintaining the freedom of learning. After the death of
Frederick the Great, Bahrdt had to resign his post, and took to keeping
an inn at a vineyard near Halle. By ridiculing Wollner's edict (1788),
he brought on himself a year of confinement in a fortress. He died in
disrepute, in 1792.
<P>
Bahrdt had begun as an orthodox cleric. In Halle he gave up his
belief in revelation, and endeavoured to explain religion on the ground
of reason. To this period belong the "Popular Letters about the Bible,"
which were afterwards continued in the further series, "An Explanation
of the Plans and Aims of Jesus."
<P>
His treatment of the life of Jesus has been too severely censured. The
work is not without passages which show a real depth of feeling, espe-
cially in the continually recurring explanations regarding the relation
of belief in miracle to true faith, in which the actual description of the
life of Jesus lies embedded. And the remarks about the teaching of Jesus
are not always commonplace. But the paraphernalia of dialogues of
portentous length make it, as a whole, formless and inartistic. The introduction of a galaxy of imaginary characters — Haram, Schimah, Avel,
Limmah, and the like — is nothing less than bewildering.
<P>
Bahrdt finds the key to the explanation of the life of Jesus in the
appearance in the Gospel narrative of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. They are not disciples of Jesus, but belong to the upper classes;
what role, then, can they have played in the life of Jesus, and how came
they to intercede on His behalf? They were Essenes. This Order had
secret members in all ranks of society, even in the Sanhedrin. It had set
itself the task of detaching the nation from its sensuous Messianic hopes
and leading it to a higher knowledge of spiritual truths. It had the most
widespread ramifications, extending to Babylon and to Egypt. In order
<P>
<center>40</center>
<P>
to deliver the people from the limitations of the national faith, which
could only lead to disturbance and insurrection, they must find a Messiah
who would destroy these false Messianic expectations. They were therefore on the look-out for a claimant of the Messiahship whom they could
make subservient to their aims.
<P>
Jesus came under the notice of the Order immediately after His birth.
As a child He was watched over at every step by the Brethren. At the
feasts at Jerusalem, Alexandrian Jews, secret members of the Essene
Order, put themselves into communication with Him, explained to Him
the falsity of the priests, inspired Him with a horror of the bloody
sacrifices of the Temple, and made him acquainted with Socrates and
Plato. This is set forth in dialogues of a hundred pages long. At the
story of the death of Socrates, the boy bursts into a tempest of sobs which
His friends are unable to calm. He longs to emulate the martyr-death
of the great Athenian.
<P>
On the market-place at Nazareth a mysterious Persian gives Him two
sovereign remedies — one for affections of the eye, the other for nervous
disorders.
<P>
His father does his best for Him, teaching Him, along with His cousin
John, afterwards the Baptist, about virtue and immortality. A priest belonging to the Essene Order, who makes their acquaintance disguised as
a shepherd, and takes part in their conversations, leads the lads deeper
into the knowledge of wisdom. At twelve years old, Jesus is already so
far advanced that He argues with the Scribes in the Temple concerning
miracles, maintaining the thesis that they are impossible.
<P>
When they feel themselves ready to appear in public the two cousins
take counsel together how they can best help the people. They agree to
open the eyes of the people regarding the tyranny and hypocrisy of the
priests. Through Haram, a prominent member of the Essene Order, Luke
the physician is introduced to Jesus and places all his science at His
disposal.
<P>
In order to produce any effect they were obliged to practise accommodation to the superstitions of the people, and introduce their wisdom to
them under the garb of folly, in the hope that, beguiled by its attractive
exterior, the people would admit into their minds the revelation of rational truth, and after a time be able to emancipate themselves from
superstition. Jesus, therefore, sees Himself obliged to appear in the role
of the Messiah of popular expectation, and to make up His mind to
work by means of miracles and illusions. About this He felt the gravest
scruples. He was obliged, however, to obey the Order; and His scruples
were quieted by the reminder of the lofty end which was to be reached
by these means. At last, when it is pointed out to Him that even Moses
had followed the same plan. He submits to the necessity. The influential
<P>
<center>41</center>
<P>
Order undertakes the duty of stage-managing the miracles, and that of
maintaining His father. On the reception of Jesus into the number of the
Brethren of the First Degree of the Order it is made known to Him that
these Brethren are bound to face death in the cause of the Order; but
that the Order, on its part, undertakes so to use the machinery and influence at its disposal that the last extremity shall always be avoided and
the Brother mysteriously preserved from death.
<P>
Then begins the cleverly staged drama by means of which the people
are to be converted to rational religion. The members of the Order are
divided into three classes: The Baptized, The Disciples, The Chosen
Ones. The Baptized receive only the usual popular teaching; the
Disciples are admitted to further knowledge, but are not entrusted with
the highest mysteries; the Chosen Ones, who in the Gospels are also
spoken of as "Angels," are admitted into all wisdom. As the Apostles
were only members of the Second Degree, they had not the smallest
suspicion of the secret machinery which was at work. Their part in
the drama of the life of Jesus was that of zealous "supers." The Gospels
which they composed therefore report, in perfect good faith, miracles
which were really clever illusions produced by the Essenes, and they
depict the life of Jesus only as seen by the populace from the outside.
<P>
It is therefore not always possible for us to discover how the events
which they record as miracles actually came about. But whether they
took place in one way or another — and as to this we can sometimes get
a clue from a hint in the text — it is certain that in all cases the process
was natural. With reference to the feeding of the five thousand, Bahrdt
remarks: "It is more reasonable here to think of a thousand ways by
which Jesus might have had sufficient supplies of bread at hand, and
by the distribution of it have shamed the disciples' lack of courage, than
to believe in a miracle." The explanation which he himself prefers is that
the Order had collected a great quantity of bread in a cave and this was
gradually handed out to Jesus, who stood at the concealed entrance and
took some every time the apostles were occupied in distributing the
lormer supply to the multitude. The walking on the sea is to be explained
by supposing that Jesus walked towards the disciples over the surface of
a great floating raft; while they, not being able to see the raft, must needs
suppose a miracle. When Peter tried to walk on the water he failed miserably. The miracles of healing are to be attributed to the art of Luke. He
also called the attention of Jesus to remarkable cases of apparent death,
which He then took in hand, and restored the apparently dead to their
sorrowing friends. In such cases, however, the Lord never failed expressly to inform the disciples that the persons were not really dead.
They, however, did not permit this assurance to deprive them of their
faith in the miracle which thev felt thev had themselves witnessed.
<P>
<center>42</center>
<P>
In teaching, Jesus had two methods: one, exoteric, simple, for the
world; the other, esoteric, mystic, for the initiate. "No attentive reader
of the Bible," says Bahrdt, "can fail to notice that Jesus made use of
two different styles of speech. Sometimes He spoke so plainly and in
such universally intelligible language, and declared truths so simply and
so well adapted to the general comprehension of mankind that even the
simplest could follow Him. At other times he spoke so mystically, so
obscurely, and in so veiled a fashion that words and thoughts alike
baffled the understandings of ordinary people, and even by more practised minds were not to be grasped without close reflection, so that we
are told in John vi. 60 that 'many of His disciples, when they heard this,
said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?' And Jesus Himself did
not deny it, but only told them that the reason of their not understanding
His sayings lay in their prejudices, which made them interpret everything literally and materially, and overlook the ethical meaning which
•underlay His figurative language." Most of these mystical discourses are
to be found in John, who seems to have preserved for us the greater part
of the secret teaching imparted to the initiate. The key to the understanding of this esoteric teaching is to be found, therefore, in the prologue to John's Gospel, and in the sayings about the new birth. "To be
born again" is identical with the degree of perfection which was attained
in the highest class of the Brotherhood.
<P>
The members of the Order met on appointed days in caves among the
hills. When we are told in the Gospels that Jesus went alone into a mountain to pray, this means that He repaired to one of these secret gatherings, but the disciples, of course, knew nothing about that. The Order
had its hidden caves everywhere; in Galilee as well as in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.
<P>
"Only by sensuous means can sensuous ideas be overcome." The Jewish Messiah must die and rise again, in order that the false conceptions
of the Messiah which were cherished by the multitude might be destroyed
in the moment of their fulfilment — that is, might be spiritualised. Nicodemus, Haram, and Luke met in a cave in order to take counsel how they
might bring about the death of Jesus in a way favourable to their plans.
Luke guaranteed that by the aid of powerful drugs which he would give
Him the Lord should be enabled to endure the utmost pain and suffering
and yet resist death for a long time. Nicodemus undertook so to work
matters in the Sanhedrin that the execution should follow immediately upon the sentence, and the crucified remain only a short time
upon the cross. At this moment Jesus rushed into the cave. He had
scarcely had time to replace the stone which concealed the entrance, so
closely had He been pursued over the rocks by hired assassins. He Himself is firmly resolved to die, but care must be taken that He shall not be
<P>
<center>43</center>
<P>
simply assassinated, or the whole plan fails. If He falls by the assassin's
knife, no resurrection will be possible.
<P>
In the end, the piece is staged to perfection. Jesus provokes the
authorities by His triumphal Messianic entry. The unsuspected Essenes
in the council urge on His arrest and secure His condemnation — though
Pilate almost frustrates all their plans by acquitting Him. Jesus, by uttering a loud cry and immediately afterwards bowing His head, shows
every appearance of a sudden death. The centurion has been bribed not
to allow any of His bones to be broken. Then comes Joseph of Ramath,
as Bahrdt prefers to call Joseph of Arimathea, and removes the body to
the cave of the Essenes, where he immediately commences measures of
resuscitation. As Luke had prepared the body of the Messiah by means
of strengthening medicines to resist the fearful ill-usage which He had
gone through — the being dragged about and beaten and finally crucified
— these efforts were crowned with success. In the cave the most strengthening nutriment was supplied to Him. "Since the humours of the body
were in a thoroughly healthy condition, His wounds healed very readily,
and by the third day He was able to walk, in spite of the fact that the
wounds made by the nails were still open."
<P>
On the morning of the third day they forced away the stone which
closed the mouth of the grave. As Jesus was descending the rocky slopes
the watch awakened and took to flight in alarm. One of the Essenes appeared, in the garb of an angel, to the women and announced to them
the resurrection of Jesus. Shortly afterwards the Lord appeared to Mary.
At the sound of His voice she recognises Him. "Thereupon Jesus tells
her that He is going to His Father (to heaven — in the mystic sense of the
word — that is to say, to the Chosen Ones in their peaceful dwellings of
truth and blessedness — to the circle of His faithful friends, among whom
He continued to live, unseen by the world, but still working for the advancement of His purpose). He bade her tell His disciples that He was
alive."
<P>
From His place of concealment He appeared several times to His
disciples. Finally He bade them meet Him at the Mount of Olives, near
Bethany, and there took leave of them. After exhorting them, and embracing each of them in turn, He tore Himself away from them and
walked away up the mountain. "There stood those poor men, amazed —
beside themselves with sorrow — and looked after Him as long as they
could. But as He mounted higher, He entered ever deeper into the cloud
which lay upon the hill-top, until finally He was no longer to be seen.
The cloud received Him out of their sight."
<P>
From the mountain He returned to the chief lodge of the Brotherhood.
Only at rare intervals did He again intervene in active life — as on the
occasion when He appeared to Paul upon the road to Damascus. But,
<P>
<center>44</center>
<P>
though unseen. He continued to direct the destinies of the community
until His death.
<P>
Venturini's "Non-supernatural History of the Great Prophet of Nazareth" is related to Bahrdt's work as the finished picture to the sketch.
<P>
Karl Heinrich Venturini was born at Brunswick in 1768. On the
completion of his theological studies he vainly endeavoured to secure a
post as Docent in the theological faculty at Helmstadt, or as Librarian
at Wolfenbiittel.
<P>
His life was blameless and his personal piety beyond reproach, but he
was considered to be too free in his ideas. The Duke of Brunswick was
personally well disposed towards him, but did not venture to give him
a post on the teaching staff in face of the opposition of the consistories.
He was reduced to earning a bare pittance by literary work, and finally
in 1806 was thankful to accept a small living in Hordorf near Brunswick.
He then abandoned theological writing and devoted his energies to recording the events of contemporary history, of which he published a
yearly chronicle — a proceeding which under the Napoleonic regime was
not always unattended with risk, as he more than once had occasion to
experience. He continued this undertaking till 1841. In 1849 death
released him from his tasks.
<P>
Venturini's fundamental assumption is that it was impossible, even
for the noblest spirit of mankind, to make Himself understood by the
Judaism of His time except by clothing His spiritual teaching in a sensuous garb calculated to please the oriental imagination, "and, in general,
by bringing His higher spiritual world into such relations with the lower
sensuous world of those whom He wished to teach as was necessary to
the accomplishment of His aims." "God's Messenger was morally bound
to perform miracles for the Jews. These miracles had an ethical purpose,
and were especially designed to counteract the impression made by the
supposed miracles of the deceivers of the people, and thus to hasten
the overthrow of the kingdom of Satan."
<P>
For modern medical science the miracles are not miraculous. He never
healed without medicaments and always carried His "portable medicine
chest" with Him. In the case of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter,
for example, we can still detect in the narrative a hint of the actual
course of events. The mother explains the case to Jesus. After enquiring where her dwelling was He made a sign to John, and continued to
hold her in conversation. The disciple went to the daughter and gave
her a sedative, and when the mother returned she found her child
cured.
<P>
The raisings from the dead were cases of coma. The nature-miracles
were due to a profound acquaintance with the powers of Nature and the
<P>
<center>45</center>
<P>
order of her processes. They involve fore-knowledge rather than control.
<P>
Many miracle stories rest on obvious misunderstandings. Nothing
could be simpler than the explanation of the miracle at Cana. Jesus had
brought with Him as a wedding-gift some jars of good wine and had put
them aside in another room. When the wine was finished and His mother
became anxious, He still allowed the guests to wait a little, as the stone
vessels for purification had not yet been filled with water. When that
had been done He ordered the servants to pour out some of his wine, but
to tell no one whence it came. When John, as an old man, wrote his
Gospel, he got all this rather mixed up — had not indeed observed it very
closely at the time, "had perhaps been the least thing merry himself,"
says Venturini, and had believed in the miracle with the rest. Perhaps,
too, he had not ventured to ask Jesus for an explanation, for he had only
become His disciple a few days before.
<P>
The members of the Essene Order had watched over the child Jesus
even in Egypt. As He grew older they took charge of His education along
with that of His cousin, John, and trained them both for their work as
deliverers of the people. Whereas the nation as a whole looked to an
insurrection as the means of its deliverance, they knew that freedom
could only be achieved by means of a spiritual renewal. Once Jesus and
John met a band uf insurgents: Jesus worked on them so powerfully by
His fervid speech that they recognised the impiousness of their purpose.
One of them sprang towards Him and laid down his arms; it was Simon,
who afterwards became His disciple.
<P>
When Jesus was about thirty years old, and, owing to the deep experiences of His inner life, had really far outgrown the aims of the Essene
Order, He entered upon His office by demanding baptism from John.
Just as this was taking place a thunderstorm broke, and a dove, frightened by the lightning, fluttered round the head of Jesus. Both Jesus and
John took this as a sign that the hour appointed by God had come.
<P>
The temptations in the wilderness, and upon the pinnacle of the
Temple, were due to the machinations of the Pharisee Zadok, who pretended to enter into the plans of Jesus and feigned admiration for Him
in order the more surely to entrap Him. It was Zadok, too, who stirred
up opposition to Him in the Sanhedrin.
<P>
But Jesus did not succeed in destroying the old Messianic belief with
its earthly aims. The hatred of the leading circles against Him grew, although He avoided everything "that could offend their prejudices." It
was for this reason that He even forbade His disciples to preach the
Gospel beyond the borders of Jewish territory. He paid the temple-tax,
also, although he had no fixed abode. When the collector went to Peter
about it, the following dialogue took place.
<P>
<i>Tax-collector (drawing Peter aside)</i>. Tell me, Simon, does the Rabbi
<P>
<center>46</center>
<P>
pay the didrachma to the Temple treasury, or should we not trouble
Him about it?
<P>
<i>Peter</i>. Why shouldn't He pay it? Why do you ask?
<P>
<i>Tax-collector</i>. It's been owing from both of you since last Nisan, as
our books show. We did not like to remind your Master, out of reverence.
<P>
<i>Peter</i>. I'll tell Him at once. He will certainly pay the tax. You need
have no fear about that.
<P>
<i>Tax-collector</i>. That's good. That will put everything straight, and we
shall have no trouble over our accounts. Good-bye!
<P>
When Jesus hears of it He commands Peter to go and catch a fish, and
to take care, in removing the hook, not to tear its mouth, that it may be
fit for salting (!) In that case it will doubtless be worth a stater.
<P>
The time arrived when an important move must be made. In full
conclave of the Secret Society it was resolved that Jesus should go up to
Jerusalem and there publicly proclaim Himself as the Messiah. Then He
was to endeavour to disabuse the people of their earthly Messianic expectations.
<P>
The triumphal entry succeeded. The whole people hailed Him with
acclamations. But when He tried to substitute for their picture of the
Messiah one of a different character, and spoke of times of severe trial
which should come upon all, when He showed Himself but seldom in the
Temple, instead of taking His place at the head of the people, they began
to doubt Him.
<P>
Jesus was suddenly arrested and put to death. Here, then, the death
is not, as in Bahrdt, a piece of play-acting, stage-managed by the Secret
Society. Jesus really expected to die, and only to meet His disciples again
in the eternal life of the other world. But when He so soon gave up the
ghost, Joseph of Arimathea was moved by some vague premonition to
hasten at once to Pontius Pilate and make request for His body. He
offers the Procurator money. Pilate (sternly and emphatically): "Dost
thou also mistake me? Am I, then, such an insatiable miser? Still, thou
art a Jew—how could this people do me justice? Know, then, that a
Roman can honour true nobility wherever he may find it. (He sits down
and writes some words on a strip of parchment.) Give this to the captain
of the guard. Thou shall be permitted to remove the body. I ask nothing
for this. It is granted to thee freely."
<P>
"A tender embrace from his wife rewarded the noble deed of the
Roman, while Joseph left the Praetorium, and with Nicodemus, who was
impatiently awaiting him, hastened to Golgotha." There he received the
body; he washed it, anointed it with spices, and laid it on a bed of moss
in the rock-hewn grave. From the blood which was still flowing from the
wound in the side, he ventured to draw a hopeful augury, and sent word
to the Essene Brethren. They had a hold close by, and promised to watch
<P>
<center>47</center>
<P>
over the body. In the first four-and-twenty hours no movement of life
showed itself. Then came the earthquake. In the midst of the terrible
commotion a Brother, in the white robes of the Order, was making his
way to the grave by a secret path. When he, illumined by a flash of lightning, suddenly appeared above the grave, and at the same moment the
earth shook violently, panic seized the watch, and they fled. In the morning the Brother hears a sound from the grave: Jesus is moving. The
whole Order hastens to the spot, and Jesus is removed to their Lodge.
Two brethren remain at the grave—these were the "angels" whom the
women saw later. Jesus, in the dress of a gardener, is afterwards recognised by Mary Magdalene. Later, He comes out at intervals ficm the
hiding-place, where He is kept by the Brethren, and appears to the
disciples. After forty days He took His leave of them: His strength was
exhausted. The farewell scene gave rise to the mistaken impression of His
Ascension.
<P>
From the historical point of view these lives are not such contemptible
performances as might be supposed. There is much penetrating observation in them. Bahrdt and Venturini are right in feeling that the connexion of events in the life of Jesus has to be discovered; the Gospels
give only a series of occurrences, and offer no explanation why they happened just as they did. And if, in making Jesus subservient to the plans
of a secret society, they represented Him as not acting with perfect
freedom, but as showing a certain passivity, this assumption of theirs
was to be brilliantly vindicated, a hundred years later, by the eschatological school, which asserts the same remarkable passivity on the part
of Jesus, in that He allows His actions to be determined, not indeed by
a secret society, but by the eschatological plan of God. Bahrdt and Venturini were the first to see that, of all Jesus' acts, His death was most
distinctively His own, because it was by this that He purposed to found
the kingdom.
<P>
Venturini's "Non-supernatural History of the Great Prophet of Nazareth" may almost be said to be reissued annually down to the present
day, for all the fictitious "Lives" go back directly or indirectly to the
type which he created. It is plagiarised more freely than any other Life
of Jesus, although practically unknown by name.
