THE IDEAL LIFE OF JESUS AT THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
is the Life which Heinrich Julius Holtzmann did not write-but which
can be pieced together from his commentary on the Synoptic Gospels
and his New Testament Theology. [1] It is ideal because, for one thing, it
is unwritten, and arises only in the idea of the reader by the aid of his
own imagination, and, for another, because it is traced only in the most
general outline. What Holtzmann gives us is a sketch of the public
ministry, a critical examination of details, and a full account of the
teaching of Jesus. He provides, therefore, the plan and the prepared
building material, so that any one can carry out the construction in
his own way and on his own responsibility. The cement and the mortar
are not provided by Holtzmann; every one must decide for himself how
he will combine the teaching and the life, and arrange the details within
each.
<P>
We may recall the fact that Weisse, too, the other founder of the
Marcan hypothesis, avoided writing a Life of Jesus, because the difficulty
of of fitting the details into the ground-plan appeared to him so great, not
to say insuperable. It is just this modesty which constitutes his greatness
and Holtzmann's. Thus the Marcan hypothesis ends, as it had begun,
with a certain historical scepticism. [2]
<P>
[1] Heinrich Julius Holtzmann, <i>Handkommentar. Die Synoptiker</i>. 1st ed., 1889;
2nd ed., 1901. <i>Lehrbuch der neutestamentlichen Theologie</i>, 1896, vol. i.
<P>
[2] In the Catholic Church the study of the Life of Jesus has remained down to
the present day entirely free from scepticism. The reason of that is, that in principle
it hasremained at a pre-Straussian standpoint, and does not venture upon an
unreserved spplication of historical considerations either to the miracle question
or to the Johannine question, and naturally therefore resigns the attempt to take
count of and explain the great historical problems.
<P>
We may name the following Lives of Jesus produced by German Catholic
writers:-
<P>
Joh. Nep. Sepp, <i>Das Leben Jesu Christi</i>. Regensburg, 1843-1846. 7 vols., 2nd
ed., 1853-1862.
<P>
Peter Schegg, <i>Sechs Bucher des Lebens Jesu</i>. (The Life of Jesus in Six Books.)
Freiburg, 1874-1875. c. 1200 pp.
<P>
Joseph Grimm, <i>Das Leben Jesu</i>. Wurzburg, 2nd ed., 1890-1903. 6 vols.
<P>
Richard von Kralik, <i>Jesu Leben und Werk</i>. Kempten-Nurnberg, 1904. 481 pp.
<P>
W. Capitaine, <i>Jesus von Nazareth</i>. Regensburg, 1905. 192 pp.
<P>
How narrow are ihe limits within which the Catholic study of the life of Jesus
moves even when it aims at scientific treatment, is illustrated by Hermann Schell's
<i>Christus</i> (Mainz, 1903. 152 pp.). After reading the forty-two questions with
which he introduces his narrative one might suppose that the author was well
aware of the bearing of all the historical problems of the life of Jesus, and intended
to supply an answer to them. Instead of doing so, however, he adopts as the work
proceeds more and more the role of an apologist, not facing definitely either the
miracle question or the Johannine question, but gliding over the difficulties by the
aid of ingenious headings, so that in the end his book almost takes the form of an
explanatory text to the eighty-nine illustrations which adorn the book and make
it difficult to read.
<P>
In France, Renan's work gave the incentive to an extensive Catholic "Life-of-
Jesus" literature. We may name the following:-
<P>
Louis Veuillot, <i>La Vie de notre Seigneur Jesus-Christ</i>. Paris, 1864. 509 pp.
German by Waldeyer. Koln-Neuss, 1864. 573 pp.
<P>
H. Wallon, <i>Vie de notre Seigneur Jesus-Christ</i>. Paris, 1865. 355 pp.
<P>
A work which met with a particularly favourable reception was that of Pere
Didon, the Dominican, <i>Jesus-Christ</i>, Paris, 1891, 2 vols., vol. i. 483 pp., vol. ii.
469 pp. The German translation is dated 1895.
<P>
In the same year there appeared a new edition of the "Bitter Sufferings of Our
Lord Jesus Christ" (see above, p. 109 f.) by Katharina Emmerich; the cheap
popular edition of the translation of Renan's "Life of Jesus"; and the eighth
edition of Strauss's "Life of Jesus for the German People."
<P>
We may quote from the ecclesiastical <i>Approbation</i> printed at the beginning of
Didon's Life of Jesus. "If the author sometimes seems to speak the language of his
opponents, it is at once evident that he has aimed at defeating them on their own
ground, and he is particularly successful in doing so when he confronts their irreligious
a priori theories with the positive arguments of history."
<P>
As a matter of fact the work is skilfully written, but without a spark of understanding of the historical questions.
<P>
All honour to Alfred Loisy! (<i>Le Quatrieme Evangile</i>, Paris, 1903, 960 pp.), who
takes a clear view on the Johannine question, and denies the existence ot a Johannine
historical tradition. But what that means for the Catholic camp may be recognised
from the excitement produced by the book and its express condemnation.
See also the same writer's <i>L'Evangile et l' Eglise</i> (German translation, Munich, 1904
189 pp.), in which Loisy here and there makes good historical points against
Harnack's "What is Christianity?"
<P>
<center>296</center>
<P>
The subordinates, it is true, do not allow themselves to be disturbed
by the change of attitude at head-quarters. They keep busily at work
That is their right, and therein consists their significance. By keeping
on trying to take the positions, and constantly failing, they furnish a
practical proof that the plan of operations worked out by the general
<P>
<center>297</center>
<P>
staff is not capable of being carried out, and show why it is so, and
what kind of new tactics will have to be evolved.
<P>
The credit of having written a life of Christ which is strictly scientific,
in its own way very remarkable, and yet foredoomed to failure, belongs
to Oskar Holtzmann. [1] He has complete confidence in the Marcan plan,
and makes it his task to fit all the sayings of Jesus into this framework,
to show "what can belong to each period of the preaching of Jesus, and
what cannot." His method is to give free play to the magnetic power of
the most important passages in the Marcan text, making other sayings
of similar import detach themselves from their present connexion and
come and group themselves round the main passages.
<P>
For example, the controversy with the scribes at Jerusalem regarding
the charge of doing miracles by the help of Satan (Mark iii. 22-30)
belongs, according to Holtzmann, as regards content and chronology, to
the same period as the controversy, in Mark vii., about the ordinances
of men which results in Jesus being "obliged to take to flight"; the woes
pronounced upon Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, which now follow on the eulogy upon the Baptist (Matt. xi. 21-23), and are accordingly represented as having been spoken at the time of the sending
forth of the Twelve, are drawn by the same kind of magnetic force into
the neighbourhood of Mark vii., and "express very clearly the attitude
of Jesus at the time of His withdrawal from the scene of His earlier
ministry." The saying in Matt. vii. 6 about not giving that which is holy
to the dogs or casting pearls before swine, does not belong to the Sermon
on the Mount, but to the time when Jesus, after Caesarea Philippi, for-
bids the disciples to reveal the secret of His Messiahship to the multi-
tude; Jesus' action in cursing the fig-tree so that it should henceforth
bring no fruit to its owner, who was perhaps a poor man, is to be brought
into relation with the words spoken on the evening before, with reference,
to the lavish expenditure involved in His anointing, "The poor ye have
always with you," the point being that Jesus now, "in the clear consciousness of His approaching death, feels His own worth," and dismisses "the contingency of even the poor having to lose something for
His sake" with the words "it does not matter." [2]
<P>
[1] Oskar Holtzmann, Professor of Theology at Giessen, was born in 1859 at
Stuttgart.
<P>
[2] This  suggestlon reminds us involuntarily of the old rationalistic Lives of Jesus,
which are distressed that Jesus should have injured the good people of the country
of the Gesarenes by sacrificing their swine in healing the demoniac. A good deal of
old rationalistic material crops up in the very latest Lives of Jesus, as cannot indeed
fail to be the case in view of the arbitrary interpretation of detail which is common
to both. According to Oskar Holtzmann the barren fig-tree has also a symbolical
meaning. "It is a pledge given by God to Jesus that His faith shall not be put to
shame in the great work of His life."
<P>
<center>298</center>
<P>
All these transpositions and new connexions mean, it is clear, a great
deal of internal and external violence to the text.
<P>
A further service rendered by this very thorough work of Oskar
Holtzmann's, is that of showing how much reading between the lines
is necessary in order to construct a Life of Jesus on the basis of the
Marcan hypothesis in its modern interpretation. It is thus, for instance
that the author must have acquired the knowledge that the controversy
about the ordinances of purification in Mark vii. forced the people "to
choose between the old and the new religion"-in which case it is no
wonder that many "turned back from following Jesus."
<P>
Where are we told that there was any question of an old and a new
"religion"? The disciples certainly did not think of things in this way
as is shown by their conduct at the time of His death and the discourses
of Peter in Acts. Where do we read that the people turned away from
Jesus? In Mark vii. 17 and 24 all that is said is, that Jesus left the people,
and in Mark vii. 33 the same multitude is still assembled when Jesus
returns from the "banishment" into which Holtzmann relegates Him.
<P>
Oskar Holtzmann declares that we cannot tell what was the size of the
following which accompanied Jesus in His journey northwards, and is
inclined to assume that others besides the Twelve shared His exile. The
Evangelists, however, say clearly that it was only the <font face="Symbol">maqhtai</font>, that is,
the Twelve, who were with Him. The value which this special knowledge,
independent of the text, has for the author, becomes evident a little
farther on. After Peter's confession Jesus calls the "multitude" to Him
(Mark viii. 34) and speaks to them of His sufferings and of taking up
the cross and following Him. This "multitude" Holtzmann wants to make
"the whole company of Jesus' followers," "to which belonged, not only
the Twelve whom Jesus had formerly sent out to preach, but many others
also." The knowledge drawn from outside the text is therefore required
to solve a difficulty in the text.
<P>
But how did His companions in exile, the remnant of the previous
multitude, themselves become a multitude, the same multitude as before.
Would it not be better to admit that we do not know how, in a Gentile
country, a multitude could suddenly rise out of the ground as it were,
continue with Him until Mark ix. 30, and then disappear into the earth
as suddenly as they came, leaving Him to pursue His journey towards
Galilee and Jerusalem alone?
<P>
Another thing which Oskar Holtzmann knows is that it required a
good deal of courage for Peter to hail Jesus as Messiah, since the "exile
wandering about with his small following in a Gentile country" answered
"so badly to the general picture which people had formed of the coining
of the Messiah." He knows too, that in the moment of Peter's confession,
"Christianity was complete" in the sense that "a community separate
<P>
<center>299</center>
<P>
from Judaism and centering about a new ideal, then arose." This
"community" frequently appears from this point onwards. There is nothing
about it in the narratives, which know only the Twelve and the
people.
<P>
Oskar Holtzmann's knowledge even extends to dialogues which are
not reported in the Gospels. After the incident at Caesarea Philippi, the
minds of the disciples were, according to him, pre-occupied by two
questions. "How did Jesus know that He was the Messiah?" and "What
will be the future fate of this Messiah?" The Lord answered both questions. He spoke to them of His baptism, and "doubtless in close connexion with that" He told them the story of His temptation, during
which He had laid down the lines which He was determined to follow
as Messiah.
<P>
Of the transfiguration, Oskar Holtzmann can state with confidence,
"that it merely represents the inner experience of the disciples at the
moment of Peter's confession." How is it then that Mark expressly dates
that scene, placing it (ix. 2) six days after the discourse of Jesus about
taking up the cross and following Him? The fact is that the time-indications
of the text are treated as non-existent whenever the Marcan hypothesis
requires an order determined by inner connexion. The statement
of Luke that the transfiguration took place eight days after, is dismissed
in the remark "the motive of this indication of time is doubtless to be
found in the use of the Gospel narratives for reading in public worship;
the idea was that the section about the transfiguration should be read
on the Sunday following that on which the confession of Peter formed
the lesson." Where did Oskar Holtzmann suddenly discover this information
about the order of the "Sunday lessons" at the time when Luke's
Gospel was written?
<P>
It was doubtless from the same private source of information that
the author derived his knowledge regarding the gradual development
of the thought of the Passion in the consciousness of Jesus. "After the
confession of Peter at Caesarea Philippi," he explains, "Jesus' death
became for Him only the necessary point of transition to the glory
beyond. In the discourse of Jesus to which the request of Salome gave
occasion, the death of Jesus already appears as the means of saving
many from death, because His death makes possible the coming of the
Kingdom of God. At the institution of the Supper, Jesus regards His
imminent death as the meritorious deed by which the blessings of the
New Covenant, the forgiveness of sins and victory over sin, are permanently secured to His 'community.' We see Jesus constantly becoming more and more at home with the idea of His death and constantly
giving it a deeper interpretation."
<P>
Any one who is less skilled in reading the thoughts of Jesus, and
<P>
<center>300</center>
<P>
more simple and natural in his reading of the text of Mark, cannot fail
to observe that Jesus speaks in Mark x. 45 of His death as an expiation,
not as a means of saving others from death, and that at the Lord's
Supper there was no reference to His "community," but only to the
inexplicable "many," which is also the word in Mark x. 45. We ought to
admit freely that we do not know what the thoughts of Jesus about His
death were at the time of the first prediction of the Passion after Peter's
confession; and to be on our guard against the "original sin" of theology,
that of exalting the argument from silence, when it happens to
be useful, to the rank of positive realities.
<P>
Is there not a certain irony in the fact that the application of "natural"
psychology to the explanation of the thoughts of Jesus compels the assumption
of supra-historical private information such as this? Bahrdt
and Venturini hardly read more subjective interpretations into the text
than many modern Lives of Jesus; and the hypothesis of the secret
society, which after all did recognise and do justice to the inexplicability
from an external standpoint of the relation of events and of the conduct
of Jesus, was in many respects more historical than the psychological
links of connexion which our modernising historians discover without
having any foundation for them in the text.
<P>
In the end this supplementary knowledge destroys the historicity of
the simplest sections. Oskar Holtzmann ventures to conjecture that the
healing of the blind man at Jericho "is to be understood as a symbolical
representation of the conversion of Zacchaeus," which, of course, is
found only in Luke. Here then the defender of the Marcan hypothesis
rejects the incident by which the Evangelist explains the enthusiasm of
the entry into Jerusalem, not to mention that Luke tells us nothing whatever
about a conversion of Zacchaeus, but only that Jesus was invited
to his house and graciously accepted the invitation.
<P>
It would be something if this almost Alexandrian symbolical exegesis
contributed in some way to the removal of difficulties and to the solution of the main question, that, namely, of the present or future Messiah, the present or future Kingdom. Oskar Holtzmann lays great stress
upon the eschatological character of the preaching of Jesus regarding
the Kingdom, and assumes that, at least at the beginning, it would not
have been natural for His hearers to understand that Jesus, the herald
of the Messiah, was Himself the Messiah. Nevertheless, he is of opinion
that, in a certain sense, the presence of Jesus implied the presence of the
Kingdom, that Peter and the rest of the disciples, advancing beyond the
ideas of the multitude, recognised Him as Messiah, that this recognition
ought to have been possible for the people also, and, in that case, would
have been "the strongest incentive to abandon evil ways," and "that
Jesus at the time of His entry into Jerusalem seems to have felt that in

Isa. lxii. 11 [1] there was a direct command not to withhold the knowledge
of His Messiahship from the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
<P>
But if Jesus made a Messianic entry He must thereafter have given
Himself out as Messiah, and the whole controversy would necessarily
have turned upon this claim. This, however, was not the case. According
Holtzmann, all that the hearers could make out of that crucial question
for the Messiahship in Mark xii. 35-37 was only "that Jesus clearly
showed from the Scriptures that the Messiah was not in reality the son
of David." [2]
<P>
But how was it that the Messianic enthusiasm on the part of the
people did not lead to a Messianic controversy, in spite of the fact that
Jesus "from the first came forward in Jerusalem as Messiah"? This
difficulty O. Holtzmann seems to be trying to provide against when he
remarks in a footnote: "We have no evidence that Jesus, even during the
last sojourn in Jerusalem, was recognised as Messiah except by those
who belonged to the inner circle of disciples. The repetition by the children of the acclamations of the disciples (Matt. xxi. 15 and 16) can
hardly be considered of much importance in this connexion." According
to this, Jesus entered Jerusalem as Messiah, but except for the disciples
and a few children no one recognised His entry as having a Messianic
significance! But Mark states that many spread their garments upon the
way, and others plucked down branches from the trees and strewed
them in the way, and that those that went before and those that followed
after, cried "Hosanna!" The Marcan narrative must therefore be kept
out of sight for the moment in order that the Life of Jesus as conceived
by the modern Marcan hypothesis may not be endangered.
<P>
We should not, however, regard the evidence of supernatural knowledge and the self-contradictions of this Life of Jesus as a matter for
censure, but rather as a proof of the merits of O. Holtzmann's work. [3]

[2] "For Jesus Himself," Oskar Holtzmann argues, "this discovery"-he means
the antinomy which He had discovered in Psalm ex.-"disposed of a doubt which
had always haunted him. If He had really known Himself to be descended from
the Davidic line, He would certainly not have publicly suggested a doubt as to the
Davidic descent of the Messiah."
<P>
[3] Oskar Holtzmann's work. <i>War Jesus Ekstatiker?</i> (Tubingen, 1903, 139 pp.) is
in reality a new reading of the life of Jesus. By emphasising the ecstatic element
he breaks with the "natural" conception of the life and teaching of Jesus; and,
in so far, approaches the eschatological view. But he gives a very wide significance
to the term ecstatic, subsuming under it, it might almost be said, all the eschatological thoughts and utterances of Jesus. He explains, for instance, that "the conviction of the approaching destruction of existing conditions is ecstatic." At the
same time, the only purpose served by the hypothesis of ecstasy is to enable the
author to attribute to Jesus "The belief that in His own work the Kingdom of God
was already beginning, and the promise of the Kingdom to individuals; this can
only be considered ecstatic." The opposites which Bousset brings together by the
conception of paradox are united by Holtzmann by means of the hypothesis of
ecstasy. That is, however, to play fast and loose with the meaning of "ecstasy."
An ecstasy is, in the usual understanding of the word, an abnormal, transient
condition of excitement in which the subject's natural capacity for thought and
feeling, and therewith all impressions from without, are suspended, being superseded
by an intense mental excitation and activity. Jesus may possibly have been in an
ecstatic state at His baptism and at the transfiguration. What O. Holtzmann
represents as a kind of permanent ecstatic state is rather an eschatological fixed
idea. With eschatology, ecstasy has no essential connexion. It is possible to be
eschatologically minded without being an ecstatic, and vice versa. Philo attributes
a great importance to ecstasy in his religious life, but he was scarcely, if at all,
interested in eschatology.
<P>
<center>302</center>
<P>
He has written the last large-scale Life of Jesus, the only one which the
Marcan hypothesis has produced, and aims at providing a scientific
basis for the assumptions which the general lines of that hypothesis
compel him to make; and in this process it becomes clearly apparent
that the connexion of events can only be carried through at the decisive
passages by violent treatment, or even by rejection of the Marcan text
in the interests of the Marcan hypothesis.
<P>
These merits do not belong in the same measure to the other modern
Lives of Jesus, which follow more or less the same lines. They are short
sketches, in some cases based on lectures, and their brevity makes them
perhaps more lively and convincing than Holtzmann's work; but they
take for granted just what he felt it necessary to prove. P. W. Schmidt's
<i>Geschichte Jesu</i> (1899), which as a work of literary art has few rivals
among theological works of recent years, confines itself to pure narrative.
The volume of prolegomena which appeared in 1904, and is intended
to exhibit the foundations of the narrative, treats of the sources,
of the Kingdom of God, of the Son of Man, and of the Law. It makes the
most of the weakening of the eschatological standpoint which is manifested
in the second edition of Johannes Weiss's "Preaching of Jesus,"
but it does not give sufficient prominence to the difficulties of reconstructing
the public ministry of Jesus.

<P>
aim rather at solving new problems proposed by themselves than at restating
the old ones and adding new. They hope to meet the views of
Jonnes Weiss by strongly emphasising the eschatology, and think
they can escape the critical scepticism of writers like Volkmar and
Brandt by assuming an "Ur-Markus." Their view is, therefore, that with
a few modifications dictated by the eschatological and sceptical school,
the traditional conception of the Life of Jesus is still tenable, whereas
it is just the a priori presuppositions of this conception, hitherto held
to be self-evident, which constitute the main problems.
<P>
"It is self-evident," says von Soden in one passage, "in view of the
inner connexion in which the Kingdom of God and the Messiah stood
in the thoughts of the people . . . that in all classes the question must
have been discussed, so that Jesus could not permanently have avoided
their question, 'What of the Messiah? Art thou not He?'" Where, in
the Synoptics, is there a word to show that this is "self-evident"? When
the disciples in Mark viii. tell Jesus "whom men held Him to be," none
of them suggests that any one had been tempted to regard Him as the
Messiah. And that was shortly before Jesus set out for Jerusalem.
<P>
From the day when the envoys of the Scribes from Jerusalem first
appeared in the north, the easily influenced Galilaean multitude began,
according to von Soden, "to waver." How does he know that the Galilaeans were easily influenced? How does he know they "wavered"? The
Gospels tell us neither one nor the other. The demand for a sign was,
to quote von Soden again, a demand for a proof of His Messiahship.
"Yet another indication," adds the author, "that later Christianity, in
putting so high a value on the miracles of Jesus as a proof of His Messiahship, departed widely from the thoughts of Jesus."
<P>
Before levelling reproaches of this kind against later Christianity, it
would be well to point to some passage of Mark or Matthew in which
there is mention of a demand for a sign as a proof of His Messiahship.
<P>
When the appearance of Jesus in the south-we are still following
von Soden-aroused the Messianic expectations of the people, as they
had formerly been aroused in His native country, "they once more
failed to understand the correction of them which Jesus had made by
<P>
<center>304</center>
<P>
the manner of His entry and His conduct in Jerusalem." They are unable
to understand this "transvaluation of values," and as often as the
impression made by His personality suggested the thought that He was
the Messiah, they became doubtful again. Wherein consisted the correction
of the Messianic expectation given at the triumphal entry? Was
it that He rode upon an ass? Would it not be better if modern historical
theology, instead of always making the people "grow doubtful "
were to grow a little doubtful of itself, and begin to look for the evidence
of that "transvaluation of values" which, according to them, the
contemporaries of Jesus were not able to follow?
<P>
Von Soden also possesses special information about the "peculiar
history of the origin" of the Messianic consciousness of Jesus. He knows
that it was subsidiary to a primary general religious consciousness of
Sonship. The rise of this Messianic consciousness implies, in its turn, the
"transformation of the conception of the Kingdom of God, and explains
how in the mind of Jesus this conception was both present and future."
The greatness of Jesus is, he thinks, to be found in the fact that for
Him this Kingdom of God was only a "limiting conception"-the ultimate
goal of a gradual process of approximation. "To the question
whether it was to be realised here or in the beyond Jesus would have
answered, as He answered a similar question, 'That, no man knoweth;
no, not the Son.'"
<P>
As if He had not answered that question in the petition "Thy Kingdom come"-supposing that such a question could ever have occurred
to a contemporary-in the sense that the Kingdom was to pass from
the beyond into the present!
<P>
This modern historical theology will not allow Jesus to have formed
a "theory" to explain His thoughts about His passion. "For Him the
certainty was amply sufficient; 'My death will effect what My life has
not been able to accomplish.'"
<P>
Is there then no theory implied in the saying about the "ransom for
many," and in that about "My blood which is shed for many for the
forgiveness of sins," although Jesus does not explain it? How does von
Soden know what was "amply sufficient" for Jesus or what was not?
<P>
Otto Schmiedel goes so far as to deny that Jesus gave distinct ex-
pression to an expectation of suffering; the most He can have done-and this is only a "perhaps"-is to have hinted at it in His discourses.
<P>
In strong contrast with this confidence in committing themselves to
historical conjectures stands the scepticism with which von Soden and
Schmiedel approach the Gospels. "It is at once evident," says Schmiedel
"that the great groups of discourses in Matthew, such as the Sermon
the Mount, the Seven Parables of the Kingdom, and so forth, were not
<P>
<center>305</center>
<P>
arranged in this order in the source (the <i>Logia</i>), still less by Jesus Himself.
The order is, doubtless, due to the Evangelist. But what is the answer
the question, "On what grounds is this 'at once' clear?" [1]
<P>
Von Soden's pronouncement is even more radical. "In the composition
of the discourses," he says, "no regard is paid in Matthew, any
more than in John, to the supposed audience, or to the point of time in
the life of Jesus to which they are attributed." As early as the Sermon
on the Mount we find references to persecutions, and warnings against
false prophets. Similarly, in the charge to the Twelve, there are also
warnings, which undoubtedly belong to a later time. Intimate sayings,
evidently intended for the inner circle of disciples, have the widest
publicity given to them.
<P>
But why should whatever is incomprehensible to us be unhistorical?
Would it not be better simply to admit that we do not understand certain
connexions of ideas and turns of expression in the discourses of Jesus?
<P>
But instead even of making an analytical examination of the apparent
connexions, and stating them as problems, the discourses of Jesus and
the sections of the Gospels are tricked out with ingenious headings which
have nothing to do with them. Thus, for instance, von Soden heads the
Beatitudes (Matt. v. 3-12), "What Jesus brings to men," the following
verses (Matt. v. 13-16), "What He makes of men." P. W. Schmidt, in
his "History of Jesus," shows himself a past master in this art. "The
rights of the wife" is the title of the dialogue about divorce, as if the
question at stake had been for Jesus the equality of the sexes, and not
simply and solely the sanctity of marriage. "Sunshine for the children"
is his heading for the scene where Jesus takes the children in His arms-as if the purpose of Jesus had been to protest against severity in the
upbringing of children. Again, he brings together the stories of the man
who must first bury his father, of the rich young man, of the dispute
about precedence, of Zacchaeus, and others which have equally little
connexion under the heading "Discipline for Jesus' followers." These
often brilliant creations of artificial connexions of thought give a curious attractiveness to the works of Schmidt and von Soden. The latter's
survey of the Gospels is a really delightful performance. But this kind of
thing is not consistent with pure objective history.
<P>
[1] Schmiedel is not altogether right in making "the Heidelberg Professor Paulus"
follow the same lines as Reimarus, "except that his works, of 1804 and 1828, are less
malignant, but only the more dull for that." In reality the deistic Life of Jesus by
Reimarus, and the rationalistic Life by Paulus have nothing in common. Paulus was
perhaps influenced by Venturini, but not by Reimarus. The assertion that Strauss
wrote his "Life of Jesus for the German people" because "Renan's fame gave him
no peace" is not justified, either by Strauss's character or by the circumstances in
which the second Life of Jesus was produced.
<P>
<center>306</center>
<P>
Disposing in this lofty fashion of the connexion of events, Schmiedel
and von Soden do not find it difficult to distinguish between Mark and
"Ur-Markus"; that is, to retain just so much of the Gospel as will fit
in to their construction. Schmiedel feels sure that Mark was a skilful
writer, and that the redactor was "a Christian of Pauline sympathies."
According to "Ur-Markus," to which Mark iv. 33 belongs, the Lord
speaks in parables in order that the people may understand Him the
better; "it was only by the redactor that the Pauline theory about hardening
their hearts (Rom. ix.-xi.) was interpolated, in Mark iv. 10 ff.
and the meaning of Mark iv. 33 was thus obscured."
<P>
It is high time that instead of merely asserting Pauline influences in
Mark some proof of the assertion should be given. What kind of appearance
would Mark have presented if it had really passed through the
hands of a Pauline Christian?
<P>
Von Soden's analysis is no less confident. The three outstanding
miracles, the stilling of the storm, the casting out of the legion of devils,
the overcoming of death (Mark iv. 35-v. 43), the romantically told
story of the death of the Baptist (Mark vi. 17-29), the story of the feeding
of the multitudes in the desert, of Jesus' walking on the water, and
of the transfiguration upon an high mountain, and the healing of the
lunatic boy-all these are dashed in with a broad brush, and offer many
analogies to Old Testament stories, and some suggestions of Pauline
conceptions, and reflections of experiences of individual believers and
of the Christian community. "All these passages were, doubtless, first
written down by the compiler of our Gospel."
<P>
But how can Schmiedel and von Soden fail to see that they are heading
straight for Bruno Bauer's position? They assert that there is no
distinction of principle between the way in which the Johannine and the
Synoptic discourses are composed: the recognition of this was Bruno
Bauer's starting-point. They propose to find experiences of the Christian
community and Pauline teaching reflected in the Gospel of Mark; Bruno
Bauer asserted the same. The only difference is that he was consistent,
and extended his criticism to those portions of the Gospel which do not
present the stumbling-block of the supernatural. Why should these not
also contain the theology and the experiences of the community transformed
into history? Is it only because they remain within the limits
of the natural?
<P>
The real difficulty consists in the fact that all the passages which von
Soden ascribes to the redactor stand, in spite of their mythical colouring,
in a closely-knit historical connexion; in fact, the historical connexion is
nowhere so close. How can any one cut out the feeding of the multitudes
and the transfiguration as narratives of secondary origin without
destroying the whole of the historical fabric of the Gospel of Mark? Or
<P>
<center>307</center>
<P>
was it the redactor who created the plan of the Gospel of Mark, as von
Soden seems to imply? [1]
<P>
But in that case how can a modern Life of Jesus be founded on the
Marcan plan? How much of Mark is, in the end, historical? Why should
not Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi have been derived from the
theology of the primitive Church, just as well as the transfiguration? The
only difference is that the incident at Caesarea Philippi is more within
the limits of the possible, whereas the scene upon the mountain has a
supernatural colouring. But is the incident at Philippi so entirely
natural? Whence does Peter know that Jesus is the Messiah?
<P>
This semi-scepticism is therefore quite unjustifiable, since in Mark
natural and supernatural both stand in an equally good and close historical
connexion. Either, then, one must be completely sceptical like
Bruno Bauer, and challenge without exception all the facts and connexions
of events asserted by Mark; or, if one means to found an his-
<P>
[1] Von Soden gives on pp. 24 ff. the passages of Mark which he supposes to be
derived from the Petrine tradition in a different order from that in which they occur
in Mark, regrouping them freely. He puts together, for instance, Mark i. 16-20,
iii. 13-19, vi. 7-16, viii. 27-ix. 1, ix. 33-40, under the title "The formation and
training of the band of disciples." He supposes Mark, the pupil of Peter, to have
grouped in this way by a kind of association of ideas "what he had heard Peter
relate in his missionary journeys, when writing it down after Peter's death, not connectedly,
but giving as much as he could remember of it"; this would be in accordance
with the statement of Papias that Mark wrote "not in order." Papias's statement,
therefore, refers to an "Ur-Markus," which he found lacking in historical
order.
<P>
But what are we to make of a representative of the early Church thus approaching
the Gospels with the demand for historical arrangement? And good, simple old
Papias, of all people!
<P>
But if the Marcan plan was not laid down in "Ur-Markus," there is nothing for
it-since the plan was certainly not given in the collection of Logia-but to ascribe
it to the author of our Gospel of Mark, to the man, that is, who wrote down for the
first time these "Pauline conceptions," those reflections of experiences of individual
believers and of the community, and inserted them into the Gospel. It is proposed,
then, to retain the outline which he has given of the life of Jesus, and reject at the
same time what he relates. That is to say, he is to be believed where it is convenient
to believe him, and silenced where it is inconvenient. No more complete refutation
of the Marcan hypothesis could possibly be given than this analysis, for it destroys
its very foundation, the confident acceptance of the historicity of the Marcan plan.
<P>
If there is to be an analysis of sources in Mark, then the Marcan plan must be
ascribed to "Ur-Markus," otherwise the analysis renders the Marcan hypothesis
historically useless. But if "Ur-Markus" is to be reconstructed on the basis of
assigning to it the Marcan plan, then we cannot separate the natural from the supernatural,
for the supernatural scenes, like the feeding of the multitude and the
transfiguratlon, are among the main features of the Marcan outline.
<P>
No hypothetical analysis of "Ur-Markus" has escaped this dilemma; what it
can affect by literary methods is historically useless, and what would be historically
useful cannot be attained nor "presented" by literary methods.
<P>
<center>308</center>
<P>
torical Life of Jesus upon Mark, one must take the Gospel as a whole
because of the plan which runs right through it, accepting it as historical
and then endeavouring to explain why certain narratives, like the feeding
of the multitude and the transfiguration, are bathed in a supernatural
light, and what is the historical basis which underlies them. A
division between the natural and supernatural in Mark is purely arbitrary,
because the supernatural is an essential part of the history. The
mere fact that he has not adopted the mythical material of the childhood
stories and the post-resurrection scenes ought to have been accepted as
evidence that the supernatural material which he does embody belongs
to a category of its own and cannot be simply rejected as due to the
invention of the primitive Christian community. It must belong in some
way to the original tradition.
<P>
Oskar Holtzmann realises that to a certain extent. According to him
Mark is a writer "who embodied the materials which he received from
the tradition more faithfully than discriminatingly." "That which was
related as a symbol of inner events, he takes as history-in the case,
for example, of the temptation, the walking on the sea, the transfiguration
of Jesus." "Again in other cases he has made a remarkable occurrence
into a supernatural miracle, as in the case of the feeding of the
multitude, where Jesus' courageous love and ready organising skill
overcame a momentary difficulty, whereas the Evangelist represents it
as an amazing miracle of Divine omnipotence."
<P>
Oskar Holtzmann is thus more cautious than von Soden. He is inclined
to see in the material which he wishes to exclude from the history, not
so much inventions of the Church as mistaken shaping of history by
Mark, and in this way he gets back to genuine old-fashioned rationalism.
In the feeding of the multitude Jesus showed "the confidence of a
courageous housewife who knows how to provide skilfully for a great
crowd of children from small resources." Perhaps in a future work
Oskar Holtzmann will be less reserved, not for the sake of theology, but
of national well-being, and will inform his contemporaries what kind
of domestic economy it was which made it possible for the Lord to
satisfy with five loaves and two fishes several thousand hungry men.
<P>
Modern historical theology, therefore, with its three-quarters scepticism, is left at last with only a torn and tattered Gospel of Mark in its
hands. One would naturally suppose that these preliminary operations
upon the source would lead to the production of a Life of Jesus of a
similarly fragmentary character. Nothing of the kind. The outline is
still the same as in Schenkel's day, and the confidence with which
construction is carried out is not less complete. Only the catch-words
with which the narrative is enlivened have been changed, being
taken in part from Nietzsche. The liberal Jesus has given place to
<P>
<center>309</center>
<P>
Germanic Jesus. This is a figure which has as little to do with the
Marcan hypothesis as the "liberal" Jesus had which preceded it; otherwise
it could not so easily have survived the downfall of the Gospel of Mark
as an historical source. It is evident, therefore, that this professedly historical
Jesus is not a purely historical figure, but one which has been
artificially transplanted into history. As formerly in Renan the romantic
spirit created the personality of Jesus in its own image, so at the present
day the Germanic spirit is making a Jesus after its own likeness. What
is admitted as historic is just what the Spirit of the time can take out
of the records in order to assimilate it to itself and bring out of it a
living form.
<P>
Frenssen betrays the secret of his teachers when in <i>Hilligenlei</i> he confidently
superscribes the narrative drawn from the "latest critical investigations" with the title "The Life of the Saviour portrayed according
to German research as the basis for a spiritual re-birth of the German
nation." [1]
<P>
As a matter of fact the Life of Jesus of the "Manuscript" [2] is unsatisfactory
both scientifically and artistically, just because it aims at
being at once scientific and artistic. If only Frenssen, with his strongly
life-accepting instinct, which gives to his thinking, at least in his earliest
writings where he reveals himself without artificiality, such a wonderful
simplicity and force, had dared to read his Jesus boldly from the original
records, without following modern historical theology in all its
meanderings! He would have been able to force his way through the
underwood well enough if only he had been content to break the branches
that got in his way, instead of always waiting until some one went in
front to disentwine them for him. The dependence to which he surrenders
himself is really distressing. In reading almost every paragraph one can
tell whether Kai Jans was looking, as he wrote it, into Oskar Holtzmann
or P. W. Schmidt or von Soden. Frenssen resigns the dramatic scene
of the healing of the blind man at Jericho. Why? Because at this point
<P>
[1] Von Soden, for instance, germanises Jesus when he writes, "and this nature
is sound to the core. In spite of its inwardness there is no trace of an exaggerated
sentimentality. In spite of all the intensity of prayer there is nothing of ecstasy or
vision. No apocalyptic dream-pictures find a lodging-place in His soul."
<P>
Is a man who teaches a world-renouncing ethic which sometimes soars to the
dizzy heights such as that of Matt. xix. 12, according to our conceptions "sound to
the core"? And does not the life of Jesus present a number of occasions on which
He seems to have been in an ecstasy?
<P>
Thus, von Soden has not simply read his Jesus out of the texts, but has added
something of his own, and that something is Germanic in colouring.
<P>
[3] <i>i.e.</i>, the MS. Life of Jesus written by Kai Jans, one of the characters of the
novel. The wy in which the whole life-experience of this character prepares

out.-TRANSLATOR.
<P>
<center>310</center>
<P>
he was listening to Holtzmann, who proposes to regard the healing of
the blind man as only a symbolical representation of the "conversion of
Zacchaeus." Frenssen's masters have robbed him of all creative spontaneity.
He does not permit himself to discover motifs for himself but
confines himself to working over and treating in cruder colours those
which he finds in his teachers.
<P>
And since he cannot veil his assumptions in the cautious, carefully
modulated language of the theologians, the faults of the modern treatment
of the life of Jesus appear in him exaggerated an hundredfold.
The violent dislocation of narratives from their connexion, and the
forcing upon them of a modern interpretation, becomes a mania with
the writer and a torture to the reader. The range of knowledge not drawn
from the text is infinitely increased. Kai Jans sees Jesus after the
temptation cowering beneath the brow of the hill "a poor lonely man torn
by fearful doubts, a man in the deepest distress." He knows too that
there was often great danger that Jesus would "betray the 'Father in
heaven' and go back to His village to take up His handicraft again, but
now as a man with a torn and distracted soul and a conscience tortured
by the gnawings of remorse."
<P>
The pupil is not content, as his teachers had been, merely to make the
people sometimes believe in Jesus and sometimes doubt Him; he makes
the enthusiastic earthly Messianic belief of the people "tug and tear"
at Jesus Himself. Sometimes one is tempted to ask whether the author
in his zeal "to use conscientiously the results of the whole range of
scientific criticism" has not forgotten the main thing, the study of the
Gospels themselves.
<P>
And is all this science supposed to be new? [1] Is this picture of Jesus
really the outcome of the latest criticism? Has it not been in existence
since the beginning of the 'forties, since Weisse's criticism of the Gospel
history? Is it not in principle the same as Renan's, only that Germanic
lapses of taste here take the place of Gallic, and "German art for German
people," [2] here quite out of place, has done its best to remove from the
picture every trace of fidelity?
<P>
[1] Frenssen's Kai Jans professes to have used the "results of the whole range
of critical investigation" in writing his work. Among the books which he enumerates
and recommends in the after-word, we miss the works of Strauss, Weisse, Keim,
Volkmar, and Brandt, and, generally speaking, the names of those who in the
past have done something really great and original. Of the moderns, Johannes Weiss
is lacking. Wrede is mentioned, but is virtually ignored. Pfleiderer's remarkable
and profound presentation of Jesus in the <i>Urchristentum</i> (E.T. "Primitive Christianity," vol. ii., 1909) is non-existent so far as he is concerned.
<P>

of the soil. It has its relative justification as a protest against the long subservience
of some departments of German art to French taste.-TRANSLATOR.
<P>
<center>311</center>
<P>
Kai Jans' "Manuscript" represents the limit of the process of diminishing
the personality of Jesus. Weisse left Him still some greatness, something unexplained,
and did not venture to apply to everything the petty
standards of inquisitive modern psychology. In the 'sixties psychology
became more confident and Jesus smaller; at the close of the century
the confidence of psychology is at its greatest and the figure of Jesus
its smallest-so small, that Frenssen ventures to let His life be projected
and written by one who is in the midst of a love affair!
<P>
This human life of Jesus is to be "heart-stirring" from beginning to
to end, and "in no respect to go beyond human standards"! And this
Jesus who "racks His brains and shapes His plans" is to contribute to
bring about a re-birth of the German people. How could He? He is
Himself only a phantom created by the Germanic mind in pursuit of
a religious will-o'-the-wisp.
<P>
It is possible, however, to do injustice to Frenssen's presentation, and
to the whole of the confident, unconsciously modernising criticism of
which he here acts as the mouthpiece. These writers have the great
merit of having brought certain cultured circles nearer to Jesus and
made them more sympathetic towards Him. Their fault lies in their
confidence, which has blinded them to what Jesus is and is not, what He
can and cannot do, so that in the end they fail to understand "the signs
of the times" either as historians or as men of the present.
<P>
If the Jesus who owes His birth to the Marcan hypothesis and modern
psychology were capable of regenerating the world He would have done
it long ago, for He is nearly sixty yars old and his latest portraits are
much less life-like than those drawn by Weisse, Schenkel, and Renan,
or by Keim, the most brilliant painter of them all.
<P>
For the last ten years modern historical theology has more and more
adapted itself to the needs of the man in the street. More and more,
even in the best class of works, it makes use of attractive head-lines as
a means of presenting its results in a lively form to the masses. Intoxicated
with its own ingenuity in inventing these, it becomes more
and more confident in its cause, and has come to believe that the world's
salvation depends in no small measure upon the spreading of its own
"assured results" broad-cast among the people. It is time that it should
begin to doubt itself, to doubt its "historical" Jesus, to doubt the confidence
with which it has looked to its own construction for the moral
and religious regeneration of our time. Its Jesus is not alive, however
Germanic they may make Him.
<P>
It was no accident that the chief priest of "German art for German
people" found himself at one with the modern theologians and offered
them his alliance. Since the 'sixties the critical study of the Life of
Jesus ln Germany has been unconsciously under the influence of an
<P>
<center>312</center>
<P>
imposing modern-religious nationalism in art. It has been deflected
by it as by an underground magnetic current. It was in vain that a few
purely historical investigators uplifted their voices in protest. The
process had to work itself out. For historical criticism had become in
the hands of most of those who practised it, a secret struggle to reconcile
the Germanic religious spirit with the Spirit of Jesus of Nazareth. [1]
It was concerned for the religious interests of the present. Therefore its
error had a kind of greatness, it was in fact the greatest thing about it;
and the severity with which the pure historian treats it is in proportion
to his respect for its spirit. For this German critical study of the Life
of Jesus is an essential part of German religion. As of old Jacob wrestled
with the angel, so German theology wrestles with Jesus of Nazareth and
will not let Him go until He bless it-that is, until He will consent to
serve it and will suffer Himself to be drawn by the Germanic spirit into
the midst of our time and our civilisation. But when the day breaks, the
wrestler must let Him go. He will not cross the ford with us. Jesus of
Nazareth will not suffer Himself to be modernised. As an historic figure
He refuses to be detached from His own time. He has no answer for
the question, "Tell us Thy name in our speech and for our day!" But
He does bless those who have wrestled with Him, so that, though they
cannot take Him with them, yet, like men who have seen God face to
face and received strength in their souls, they go on their way with
renewed courage, ready to do battle with the world and its powers.
<P>
But the historic Jesus and the Germanic spirit cannot be brought together
except by an act of historic violence which in the end injures
both religion and history. A time will come when our theology, with its
pride in its historical character, will get rid of its rationalistic bias.
This bias leads it to project back into history what belongs to our own
time, the eager struggle of the modern religious spirit with the Spirit
of Jesus, and seek in history justification and authority for its beginning.
The consequence is that it creates the historical Jesus in its own
image, so that it is not the modern spirit influenced by the Spirit of
Jesus, but the Jesus of Nazareth constructed by modern historical theology,
that is set to work upon our race.                            ,
<P>
Therefore both the theology and its picture of Jesus are poor and
weak. Its Jesus, because He has been measured by the petty standard
of the modern man, at variance with himself, not to say of the modern
candidate in theology who has made shipwreck; the theologians the themselves,
because instead of seeking, for themselves and others, hoow they
may best bring the Spirit of Jesus in living power into our world, they

<P>
Any one who, admiring the force and authority of genuine rationalism
has got rid of the naive self-satisfaction of modern theology, which
is in essence only the degenerate offspring of rationalism with a tincture
of history, rejoices in the feebleness and smallness of its professedly
historical Jesus, rejoices in all those who are beginning to doubt the
truth of this portrait, rejoices in the over-severity with which it is attacked,
rejoices to take a share in its destruction.
<P>
Those who have begun to doubt are many, but most of them only make
known their doubts by their silence. There is one, however, who has
spoken out, and one of the greatest-Otto Pfleiderer. [1]
<P>
In the first edition of his <i>Urchristentum</i>, published in 1887, he still
shared the current conceptions and constructions, except that he held
the credibility of Mark to be more affected than was usually supposed
by hypothetical Pauline influences. In the second edition [2] his positive
knowledge has been ground down in the struggle with the sceptics-it
is Brandt who has especially affected him-and with the partisans of
eschatology. This is the first advance-guard action of modern theology
coming into touch with the troops of Reimarus and Bruno Bauer.
<P>
Pfieiderer accepts the purely eschatological conception of the Kingdom
of God and holds also that the ethics of Jesus were wholly conditioned
by eschatology. But in regard to the question of the Messiahship
of Jesus he takes his stand with the sceptics. He rejects the hypothesis
of a Messiah who, as being a "spiritual Messiah," conceals His claim,
but on the other hand, he cannot accept the eschatological Son-of-Man
Messiahship having reference to the future, which the eschatological
school finds in the utterances of Jesus, since it implies prophecies of
His suffering, death, and resurrection which criticism cannot admit.
Instead of finding the explanation of how the Messianic title arose
to the reflections of Jesus about the death which lay before Him," he
is inclined to find it "rather in the reflection of the Christian community
upon the catastrophic death and exaltation of its Lord after this had
actually taken place."

Even the Marcan narrative is not history. The scepticism in regard to
the main source, with which writers like Oskar Holtzmann, Schmiedel,
and von Soden conduct a kind of intellectual flirtation, is here erected
into a principle. "It must be recognised," says Pfleiderer, "that in
respect of the recasting of the history under theological influences, the
whole of our Gospels stand in principle on the same footing. The
distinction between Mark, the other two Synoptists, and John is only
relative-a distinction of degree corresponding to different stages
of theological reflection and the development of the ecclesiastical consciousness."
If only Bruno Bauer could have lived to see this triumph
of his opinions!
<P>
Pfleiderer, however, is conscious that scepticism, too, has its difficulties.
He wishes, indeed, to reject the confession of Jesus before the
Sanhedrin "because its historicity is not well established (none of the
disciples were present to hear it, and the apocalyptic prophecy which
is added. Mark xiv. 62, is certainly derived from the ideas of the primitive
Church)"; on the other hand, he is inclined to admit as possibilities-though
marking them with a note of interrogation-that Jesus may
have accepted the homage of the Passover pilgrims, and that the controversy
with the Scribes about the Son of David had some kind of
reference to Jesus Himself.
<P>
On the other hand, he takes it for granted that Jesus did not prophesy
His death, on the ground that the arrest, trial, and betrayal must have
lain outside all possibility of calculation even for Him. All these, he
thinks, came upon Jesus quite unexpectedly. The only thing that He
might have apprehended was "an attack by hired assassins," and it
is to this that He refers in the saying about the two swords in Luke
xxii. 36 and 38, seeing that two swords would have sufficed as a pro-
tection against such an attack as that, though hardly for anything
further. When, however, he remarks in this connexion that "this has
been constantly overlooked" in the romances dealing with the Life of
Jesus, he does injustice to Bahrdt and Venturini, since according to
them the chief concern of the secret society in the later period of the
life of Jesus was to protect Jesus from the assassination with which He
was menaced, and to secure His formal arrest and trial by the Sanhediin.
Their view of the historical situation is therefore identical with Pfleiderer's,
viz. that assassination was possible, but that administrative action
was unexpected and is inexplicable.
<P>
But how is this Jesus to be connected with primitive Christianity?
How did the primitive Church's belief in the Messiahship of Jesus arise?
To that question Pfleiderer can give no other answer than that of
Volkmar and Brandt, that is to say, none. He laboriously brings together
wood, straw, and stubble, but where he gets the fire from to kindle the
<P>
<center>315</center>
<P>
whole into the ardent faith of primitive Christianity he is unable to
make clear.
<P>
According to Albert Kalthoff, [1] the fire lighted itself-Christianity
arose-by spontaneous combustion, when the inflammable material,
religious and social, which had collected together in the Roman Empire,
came in contact with the Jewish Messianic expectations. Jesus of
Nazareth never existed; and even supposing He had been one of the
numerous Jewish Messiahs who were put to death by crucifixion, He
certainly did not found Christianity. The story of Jesus which lies before
us in the Gospels is in reality only the story of the way in which the
picture of Christ arose, that is to say, the story of the growth of the
Christian community. There is therefore no problem of the Life of
Jesus, but only a problem of the Christ.
<P>
Kalthoff has not indeed always been so negative. When in the year
1880 he gave a series of lectures on the Life of Jesus he felt himself
justified "in taking as his basis without further argument the generally
accepted results of modern theology." Afterwards he became so completely
doubtful about the Christ after the flesh whom he had at that
time depicted before his hearers that he wished to exclude Him even
from the register of theological literature, and omitted to enter these
lectures in the list of his writings, although they had appeared in
print. [2]
<P>
His quarrel with the historical Jesus of modern theology was that
he could find no connecting link between the Life of Jesus constructed
by the latter and primitive Christianity. Modern theology, he remarks
in one passage, with great justice, finds itself obliged to assume, at the
point where the history of the Church begins, "an immediate declension
from and falsification of, a pure original principle," and that in so doing
"it is deserting the recognised methods of historical science." If then
we cannot trace the path from its beginning onwards, we had better try
to work backwards, endeavouring first to define in the theology of the
primitive Church the values which we shall look to find again in the
Life of Jesus.
<P>
In that he is right. Modern historical theology will not have refuted

him until it has explained how Christianity arose out of the life of
Jesus without calling in that theory of an initial "Fall" of which
Harnack, Wernle, and all the rest make use. Until this modern theology
has made it in some measure intelligible how, under the influence of
the Jewish Messiah sect, in the twinkling of an eye, in every direction
at once, Graeco-Roman popular Christianity arose; until at least it has
described the popular Christianity of the first three generations it must
concede to all hypotheses which fairly face this problem and endeavour
to solve it their formal right of existence.
<P>
The criticism which Kalthoff directs against the "positive" accounts
of the Life of Jesus is, in part, very much to the point. "Jesus," he
says in one place, "has been made the receptacle into which every theologian
pours his own ideas." He rightly remarks that if we follow "the
Christ" backwards from the Epistles and Gospels of the New Testament
right to the apocalyptic vision of Daniel, we always find in Him superhuman
traits alongside of the human. "Never and nowhere," he insists,
"is He that which critical theology has endeavoured to make out of
Him, a purely natural man, an indivisible historical unit." "The title
of 'Christ' had been raised hy the Messianic apocalyptic writings so completely
into the sphere of the heroic that it had become impossible to
apply it to a mere historical man." Bruno Bauer had urged the same
considerations upon the theology of his time, declaring it to be unthinkable
that a man could have arisen among the Jews and declared "I am
the Messiah."
<P>
But the unfortunate thing is that Kalthoff has not worked through
Bruno Bauer's criticism, and does not appear to assume it as a basis,
hut remains standing half-way instead of thinking the questions through
to the end as that keen critic did. According to Kalthoff it would appear
that, year in year out, there was a constant succession of Messianic disturbances
among the Jews and of crucified claimants of the Messiahship.
"There had been many a 'Christ,'" he says in one place, "before there
was any question of a Jesus in connexion with this title."
<P>
How does Kalthoff know that? If he had fairly considered and felt
the force of Bruno Bauer's arguments, he would never have ventured
on this assertion; he would have learned that it is not only historically
unproved, but intrinsically impossible.
<P>
But Kalthoff was in far too great a hurry to present to his readers
a description of the growth of Christianity, and therewith of the picture
of the Christ, to absorb thoroughly the criticism of his great predecessor.
He soon leads his reader away from the high road of criticism into a
morass of speculation, in order to arrive by a short cut at Graeco-Roman
primitive Christianity. But the trouble is that while the guide walks
<P>
<center>317</center>
<P>
lightly and safely, the ordinary man, weighed down by the pressure of
historical considerations, sinks to rise no more.
<P>
The conjectural argument which Kalthoff follows out is in itself acute,
and forms a suitable pendent to Bauer's reconstruction of the course of
events. Bauer proposed to derive Christianity from the Graeco-Roman
philosophy; Kalthoff, recognising that the origin of popular Christianity
constitutes the main question, takes as his starting-point the social
movements of the time.
<P>
In the Roman Empire, so runs his argument, among the oppressed
masses of the slaves and the populace, eruptive forces were concentrated
under high tension. A communistic movement arose, to which the influence
of the Jewish element in the proletariat gave a Messianic-Apocalyptic
colouring. The Jewish synagogue influenced Roman social conditions
so that "the crude social ferment at work in the Roman Empire
amalgamated itself with the religious and philosophical forces of the
time to form the new Christian social movement." Early Christian writers
had learned in the synagogue to construct "personifications." The
whole Late-Jewish literature rests upon this principle. Thus "the Christ"
became the ideal hero of the Christian community, "from the socio-religious
standpoint the figure of Christ is the sublimated religious expression
for the sum of the social and ethical forces which were at work
at a certain period." The Lord's Supper was the memorial feast of this
ideal hero.
<P>
"As the Christ to whose Parousia the community looks forward this
Hero-god of the community bears within Himself the capacity for expansion
into the God of the universe, into the Christ of the Church,
who is identical in essential nature with God the Father. Thus the belief
in the Christ brought the Messianic hope of the future into the minds
of the masses, who had already a certain organisation, and by directing
their thoughts towards the future it won all those who were sick of the
past and despairing about the present."
<P>
The death and resurrection of Jesus represent experiences of the
community. "For a Jew crucified under Pontius Pilate there was certainly
no resurrection. All that is possible is a vague hypothesis of a
vision lacking all historical reality, or an escape into the vaguenesses
of theological phraseology. But for the Christian community the resurrection
was something real, a matter of fact. For the community as such
was not annihilated in that persecution: it drew from it, rather, new
strength and life."
<P>
But what about the foundations of this imposing structure?
<P>
For what he has to tell us about the condition of the Roman Empire
and the social organisation of the proletariat in the time of Trajan-
<P>
<center>318</center>
<P>
for it was then that the Church first came out into the light-we may
leave the responsibility with Kalthoff. But we must inquire more closely
how he brings the Jewish apocalyptic into contact with the Roman
proletariat.
<P>
Communism, he says, was common to both. It was the bond which
united the apocalyptic "other-worldliness" with reality. The only difficulty
is that Kalthoff omits to produce any proof out of the Jewish
apocalypses that communism was "the fundamental economic idea of
the apocalyptic writers." He operates from the first with a special
preparation of apocalyptic thought, of a socialistic or Hellenistic character.
Messianism is supposed to have taken its rise from the Deuteronomic
reform as "a social theory which strives to realise itself in
practice." The apocalyptic of Daniel arose, according to him, under
Platonic influence. "The figure of the Messiah thus became a human
figure; it lost its specifically Jewish traits." He is the heavenly prototypal
ideal man. Along with this thought, and similarly derived from
Plato, the conception of immortality makes its appearance in apocalyptic. [1]
This Platonic apocalyptic never had any existence, or at least,
to speak with the utmost possible caution, its existence must not be
asserted in the absence of all proof.
<P>
But, supposing it were admitted that Jewish apocalyptic had some
affinity for the Hellenic world, that it was Platonic and communistic,
how are we to explain the fact that the Gospels, which describe the
genesis of Christ and Christianity, imply a Galilaean and not a Roman
environment?
<P>
As a matter of fact, Kalthoff says, they do imply a Roman environment.
The scene of the Gospel history is laid in Palestine, but it is
drawn in Rome. The agrarian conditions implied in the narratives and
parables are Roman. A vineyard with a wine-press of its own could only
be found, according to Kalthoff, on the large Roman estates. So, too,
the legal conditions. The right of the creditor to sell the debtor, with
his wife and children, is a feature of Roman, not of Jewish law.
<P>
Peter everywhere symbolises the Church at Rome. The confession of
Peter had to be transferred to Caesarea Philippi because this town,
"as the seat of the Roman administration," symbolised for Palestine the
political presence of Rome.                                   ,   .
<P>
The woman with the issue was perhaps Poppaea Sabina, the wife of
Nero, "who in view of her strong leaning towards Judaism might well
be described in the symbolical style of the apocalyptic writings as the
woman who touched the hem of Jesus' garment."
<P>
[1] If Kalthoff would only have spoken of the conception of resurrection instead
of the conception of immortality! Then his subjective knowledge would have
been more or less tolerable.
<P>
<center>319</center>
<P>
The story of the unfaithful steward alludes to Pope Callixtus, who,
when the slave of a Christian in high position, was condemned to the
mines for the crime of embezzlement; that of the woman who was a
sinner refers to Marcia, the powerful mistress of Commodus, at whose
interccssion Callixtus was released, to be advanced soon afterwards to
the bishopric of Rome. "These two narratives, therefore," Kalthoff suggests,
"which very clearly allude to events well known at that time, and
doubtless much discussed in the Christian community, were admitted
into the Gospel to express the views of the Church regarding the life-story
of a Roman bishop which had run its course under the eyes of the
community, and thereby to give to the events themselves the Church's
sanction and interpretation."
<P>
Kalthoff does not, unfortunately, mention whether this is a case of
simple, ingenuous, or of conscious, didactic, Early Christian imagination.
<P>
That kind of criticism is a casting out of Satan by the aid of Beelzebub. If he was going to invent on this scale, Kalthoff need not have found
any difficulty in accepting the figure of Jesus evolved by modern theology. One feels annoyed with him because, while his thesis is ingenious, and, as against "modern theology" has a considerable measure of
justification, he has worked it out in so unmteresting a fashion. He has
no one but himself to blame for the fact that instead of leading to the
right explanation, it only introduced a wearisome and unproductive
controversy. [1]
<P>
In the end there remains scarcely a shade of distinction between
Kalthoff and his opponents. They want to bring their "historical Jesus"
into the midst of our time. He wants to do the same with his "Christ."
"A secularised Christ," he says, "as the type of the self-determined man
who amid strife and suffering carries through victoriously, and fully
realises, His own personality in order to give the infinite fullness of love
which He bears within Himself as a blessing to mankind-a Christ such
as that can awaken to new life the antique Christ-type of the Church.
He is no longer the Christ of the scholar, of the abstract theological
thinker with his scholastic rules and methods. He is the people's Christ,
the Christ of the ordinary man, the figure in which all those powers of
the human soul which are most natural and simple-and therefore most

exalted and divine-find an expression at once sensible and spiritual."
But that is precisely the description of the Jesus of modern historical
theology; why, then, make this long roundabout through scepticism?
The Christ of Kalthoff is nothing else than the Jesus of those whom he
combats in such a lofty fashion; the only difference is that he draws his
figure of Christ in red ink on blotting-paper, and because it is red in
colour and smudgy in outline, wants to make out that it is something
new.
<P>
It is on ethical grounds that Eduard von Hartmann [1] refuses to accept
the Jesus of modern theology. He finds fault with it because in its
anxiety to retain a personality which would be of value to religion it
does not sufficiently distinguish between the authentic and the "historical"
Jesus. When criticism has removed the paintings-over and retouchings
to which this authentic portrait of Jesus has been subjected,
it reaches, according to him, an unrecognisable painting below, in which
it is impossible to discover any clear likeness, least of all one of any
religious use and value.
<P>
Were it not for the tenacity and the simple fidelity of the epic
tradition, nothing whatever would have remained of the historic
Jesus. What has remained is merely of historical and psychological
interest.
<P>
At His first appearance the historic Jesus was, according to Eduard
von Hartmann, almost "an impersonal being," since He regarded Himself
so exclusively as the vehicle of His message that His personality
hardly came into the question. As time went on, however. He developed
a taste for glory and for wonderful deeds, and fell at last into a condition
of "abnormal exaltation of personality." In the end He declares
Himself to His disciples and before the council as Messiah. "When He
felt His death drawing nigh He struck the balance of His life, found His
mission a failure. His person and His cause abandoned by God, and died
with the unanswered question on His lips, 'My God, why hast thou
forsaken me?'"
<P>
It is significant that Eduard von Hartmann has not fallen into the
mistake of Schopenhauer and many other philosophers, of identifying
the pessimism of Jesus with the Indian speculative pessimism of Buddha.
The pessimism of Jesus, he says, is not metaphysical, it is "a pessimism
of indignation," born of the intolerable social and political conditions
of the time. Von Hartmann also clearly recognises the significance of
eschatology, but he does not define its character quite correctly, since he
bases his impressions solely on the Talmud, hardly making any use of

the Old Testament, of Enoch, the Psalms of Solomon, Baruch, or Fourth
Ezra. He has an irritating way of still using the name "Jehovah."
<P>
Like Reimarus-von Hartmann's positions are simply modernised
Reimarus-he is anxious to show that Christian theology has lost the
right "to treat the ideal Kingdom of God as belonging to itself." Jesus
and His teaching, so far as they have been preserved, belong to Judaism.
His ethic is for us strange and full of stumbling-blocks. He despises
work, property, and the duties of family life. His gospel is fundamentally
plebeian, and completely excludes the idea of any aristocracy
except in so far as it consents to plebeianise itself, and this is true not
only as regards the aristocracy of rank, property, and fortune, but also
the aristocracy of intellect. Von Hartmann cannot resist the temptation
to accuse Jesus of "Semitic harshness," finding the evidence of this
chiefly in Mark iv. 12, where Jesus declares that the purpose of His
parables was to obscure His teaching and cause the hearts of the people
to be hardened.
<P>
His judgment upon Jesus is: "He had no genius, but a certain talent
which, in the complete absence of any sound education, produced in
general only moderate results, and was not sufficient to preserve Him
from numerous weaknesses and serious errors; at heart a fanatic and a
transcendental enthusiast, who in spite of an inborn kindliness of disposition
hates and despises the world and everything it contains, and
holds any interest in it to be injurious to the sole true, transcendental
interest; an amiable and modest youth who, through a remarkable concatenation
of circumstances arrived at the idea, which was at that time
epidemic, [1] that He was Himself the expected Messiah, and in consequence of this met His fate."
<P>
It is to be regretted that a mind like Eduard von Hartmann's should
not have got beyond the externals of the history, and made an effort
to grasp the simple and impressive greatness of the figure of Jesus in
its eschatological setting; and that he should imagine he has disposed
of the strangeness which he finds in Jesus when he has made it as small
as possible. And yet in another respect there is something satisfactory
about his book. It is the open struggle of the Germanic spirit with Jesus.
In this battle the victory will rest with true greatness. Others wanted to
make peace before the struggle, or thought that theologians could fight
the battle alone, and spare their contemporaries the doubts about the
historical Jesus through which it was necessary to pass in order to
reach the eternal Jesus-and to this end they kept preaching reconciliation
while fighting the battle. They could only preach it on a basis of
postulates, and postulates make poor preaching! Thus, Julicher, for

example, in his latest sketches of the Life of Jesus1 distinguishes between
"Jewish and supra-Jewish" in Jesus, and holds that Jesus transferred
the ideal of the Kingdom of God "to the solid ground of the
present, bringing it into the course of historical events," and further
"associated with the Kingdom of God" the idea of development which
was utterly opposed to all Jewish ideas about the Kingdom. Julicher also
desires to raise "the strongest protest against the poor little definition
of His preaching which makes it consist in nothing further than an
announcement of the nearness of the Kingdom, and an exhortation to
the repentance necessary as a condition for attaining the Kingdom."
<P>
But when has a protest against the pure truth of history ever been
of any avail? Why proclaim peace where there is no peace, and attempt
to put back the clock of time? Is it not enough that Schleiermacher
and Ritschl succeeded again and again in making theology send on
earth peace instead of a sword, and does not the weakness of Christian
thought as compared with the general culture of our time result from
the fact that it did not face the battle when it ought to have faced it, but
persisted in appealing to a court of arbitration on which all the sciences
were represented, but which it had successfully bribed in advance?

[2] <i>Jeschua. Der klassisch'e fildische Mann. Zerstorung des kirchlichen, Enthullung
des judischen Jesus-Bildes</i>. Berlin, 1904, 112 pp. Earlier studies of the Life of Jesua
from the Jewish point of view had been less ambitious. Dr. Aug. Wunsche had
written in 1872 on "Jesus in His attitude towards women" from the Talmudic standpoint
(146 pp.), and had described Him from the same standpoint as a Jesus who rejoiced
in life, <i>Der lebensfreudige Jesus der synoptischen Evangelier. im Gegensatz W
leidenden Messias der Kirche</i>, Leipzig, 1876, 444 pp. The basis is so far correct
that the eschatological, world-renouncing ethic which we find in Jesus was due to
temporary conditions and is therefore transitory, and had nothing whatever to do
with Judaism as such. The spirit of the Law is the opposite of world-renouncing.
But the Talmud, be its traditions never so trustworthy, could teach us little about
Jesus because it has preserved scarcely a trace of that eschatological phase of
Jewish religion and ethics.

<P>
De Jonge is a Jew by birth, baptized in 1889, who on the 22nd of
November 1902 again separated himself from the Christian communion
and was desirous of being received back "with certain evangelical
reservations" into the Jewish community. In spite of his faithful observance
of the Law, this was refused. Now he is waiting "until in the
Synagogue of the twentieth century a freedom of conscience is accorded
to him equal to that which in the first century was enjoyed by John,
the beloved disciple of Jeschua of Nazareth." In the meantime he beguiles
the period of waiting by describing Jesus and His earliest followers
in the character of pattern Jews, and sets them to work in the
interest of his "Jewish views with evangelical reservations."
<P>
It is the colourless, characterless Jesus of the Superintendents and
Konsistorialrats which especially arouses his enmity. With this figure
he contrasts his own Jesus, the man of holy anger, the man of holy calm,
the man of holy melancholy, the master of dialectic, the imperious
ruler, the man of high gifts and practical ability, the man of inexorable
consistency and reforming vigour.
<P>
Jesus was, according to De Jonge, a pupil of Hillel. He demanded
voluntary poverty only in special cases, not as a general principle. In
the case of the rich young man, He knew "that the property which he
had inherited was derived in this particular case from impure sources
which must be cut off at once and for ever."
<P>
But how does De Jonge know that Jesus knew this?
<P>
A writer who is attacking the common theological picture of Jesus,
and who displays in the process, as De Jonge does, not only wit and
address, but historical intuition, ought not to fall into the error of the
theology with which he is at feud; he ought to use sober history as his
weapon against the supplementary knowledge which his opponents seem
to find between the lines, instead of meeting it with an esoteric historical
knowledge of his own.
<P>
De Jonge knows that Jesus possessed property inherited from His
father: "One proof may serve where many might be given-the hasty
flight into Egypt with his whole family to escape from Herod, and the
long sojourn in that country."
<P>
De Jonge knows-he is here, however, following the Gospel of John,
to which he everywhere gives the preference-that Jesus was between
forty and fifty years old at the time of His first coming forward publicly.
The statement in Luke iii. 23, that He was <font face="Symbol">wsei</font> thirty years old, can
only mislead those who do not remember that Luke was a portrait
painter and only meant that "Jeschua, in consequences of His glorious
beauty and His ever-youthful appearance, looked ten years younger than
He really was."
<P>
De Jonge knows also that Jesus, at the time when He first emerged
from obscurity, was a widower and had a little son-the "lad" of John
<P>
<center>324</center>
<P>
vi. 9, who had the five barley loaves and two fishes, was in fact His son.
This and many other things the author finds in "the glorious John."
According to De Jonge too we ought to think of Jesus as the aristocratic
Jew, more accustomed to a dress coat than to a workman's blouse,
something of an expert, as appears from some of the parables in
matters of the table, and conning the menu with interest when He dined
with "privy-finance-councillor" Zacchaeus.
<P>
But this is to modernise more distressingly than even the theologians!
<P>
De Jonge's one-sided preference for the Fourth Gospel is shared by
Kirchbach's book, "What did Jesus teach?" [1] but here everything, instead
of being judaised, is spiritualised. Kirchbach does not seem to
have been acquainted with Noack's "History of Jesus," otherwise he
would hardly have ventured to repeat the same experiment without the
latter's touch of genius and with much less skill and knowledge.
<P>
The teaching of Jesus is interpreted on the lines of the Kantian
philosophy. The saying, "No man hath seen God at any time," is to be
understood as if it were derived from the same system of thought as the
"Critique of Pure Reason." Jesus always used the words "death" and
"life" in a purely metaphorical sense. Eternal life is for Him not a
life in another world, but in the present. He speaks of Himself as the
Son of God, not as the Jewish Messiah. Son of Man is only the ethical
explanation of Son of God. The only reason why a Son-of-Man problem
has arisen, is because Matthew translated the ancient term Son of Man
in the original collection of Logia "with extreme literality."
<P>
The great discourse of Matt. xxiii. with its warnings and threatenings
is, according to Kirchbach, merely "a patriotic oration in which Jesus
gives expression in moving words to His opposition to the Pharisees
and His inborn love of His native land."
<P>
The teaching of Jesus is not ascetic, it closely resembles the real
teaching of Epicurus, "that is, the rejection of all false metaphysics,
and the resulting condition of blessedness, of <i>makaria</i>." The only purpose
of the demand addressed to the rich young man was to try him.
"If the youth, instead of slinking away dejectedly because he was called
upon to sell all his goods, had replied, confident in the possession of a
rich fund of courage, energy, ability, and knowledge, 'Right gladly. It
will not go to my heart to part with my little bit of property; if I'm not

to have it why then I can do without it,' the Rabbi would probably in
that case not have taken him at his word, but would have said, 'Young
man, I like you. You have a good chance before you, you may do something
in the Kingdom of God, and in any case for My sake you may
attach yourself to Me by way of trial. We can talk about your stocks
and bonds later.'"
<P>
Finally, Kirchbach succeeds, though only, it must be admitted, by
the aid of some rather awkward phraseology, in spiritualising John vi.
"It is not the body," he explains, "of the long departed thinker, who apparently
attached no importance whatever to the question of personal
survival, that we, who understand Him in the right Greek sense, 'eat';
in the sense which He intended, we eat and drink, and absorb into ourselves, His teaching, His spirit, His sublime conception of life, by constantly recalling them in connexion with the symbol of bread and flesh,
the symbol of blood, the symbol of water." [1]
<P>
Worthless as Kirchbach's Life of Jesus is from an historical point
of view, it is quite comprehensible as a phase in the struggle between
the modern view of the world and Jesus. The aim of the work is to retain
His significance for a metaphysical and non-ascetic time; and since it is
not possible to do this in the case of the historical Jesus, the author
denies His existence in favour of an apocryphal Jesus.
<P>
It is, in fact, the characteristic feature of the Life-of-Jesus literature
on the threshold of the new century even in the productions of professedly
historical and scientific theology, to subordinate the historical
interest to the interest of the general world-view. And those who "wrest
the Kingdom of Heaven" are beginning to wrest Jesus Himself along
with it. Men who have no qualifications for the task, whose ignorance
is nothing less than criminal, who loftily anathematise scientific theology instead of making themselves in some measure acquainted with
the researches which it has carried out, feel impelled to write a Life of
Jesus, in order to set forth their general religious view in a portrait
of Jesus which has not the faintest claim to be historical, and the most
far-fetched of these find favour, and are eagerly absorbed by the multitude.
<P>
It would be something to be thankful for if all these Lives of Jesus
<P>
[1] Before him, Hugo Deiff, in his History of the Rabbi Jesus of Nazareth (Leipzig,
1889, 428 pp.), had confined himself to the Fourth Gospel, and even within that
Gospel he drew some critical distinctions. His Jesus at first conceals His Messiahship
from the fear of arousing the political expectations of the people, and speaks to
them of the Son of Man in the third person. At His second visit to Jerusalem He
breaks with the rulers, is subsequently compelled, in consequence of the conflict
over the Sabbath, to leave Galilee, and then gives up His own people and turns to
the heathen. Deiff explains the raising of Lazarus by supposing him to have been
buried in a state of trance.
<P>
<center>326</center>
<P>
were based on as definite an idea and as acute historical observation as
we find in Albert Dulk's "The Error of the Life of Jesus." [1] In Dulk
the story of the fate of Jesus is also the story of the fate of religion. The
Galilaean teacher, whose true character was marked by deep religious
inwardness, was doomed to destruction from the moment when He set
Himself upon the dizzy heights of the divine sonship and the eschatological
expectation. He died in despair, having vainly expected, down
to the very last, a "telegram from heaven." Religion as a whole can
only avoid the same fate by renouncing all transcendental elements.
<P>
The vast numbers of imaginative Lives of Jesus shrink into remarkably
small compass on a close examination. When one knows two
or three of them, one knows them all. They have scarcely altered since
Venturini's time, except that some of the cures performed by Jesus are
handled in the modern Lives from the point of view of the recent investigations
in hypnotism and suggestion. [2]
<P>
According to Paul de Regia [2] Jesus was born out of wedlock. Joseph,
however, gave shelter and protection to the mother. De Regia dwells on
the beauty of the child. "His eyes were not exceptionally large, but were
well-opened, and were shaded by long, silky, dark-brown eyelashes, and
rather deep-set. They were of a blue-grey colour, which changed with
changing emotions, taking on various shades, especially blue and
brownish-grey."

pp. (The Error of the Life of Jesus. Historically apprehended and set forth.
Pt. i., The Historical Roots and the Galilaean Blossom. Pt. ii., The Messianic Entry

in 1819, he came prominently forward in the revolution of 1848, as a political
pamphleteer and agitator. Later, though almost without means, he undertook long
journeys, even to Sinai and to Lapland. Finally, he worked as a social democratic
reformer. He died in 1884.

[2] A scientific treatment of this subject is supplied by Fr. Nippold, <i>Die
psychiatrische Seite der Heilstatigkeit Jesu</i> (The Psychiatric Side of Jesus' Works
of Healing), 1889, in which a luminous review of the medical material is to be found.
See also Dr. K. Kunz, <i>Christus medicus</i>, Freiburg in Baden, 1905, 74 pp. The
scientific value of this work is, however, very much reduced by the fact that
author has no acquaintance with the preliminary questions belonging to the sphere
of history and literature, and regards all the miracles of healing as actual events,
believing himself able to explain them from the medical point of view. The tendency
of the work is mainly apologetic.

He and His disciples were Essenes, as was also the Baptist. That implies
that He was no longer a Jew in the strict sense. His preaching dealt
with the rights of man, and put forward socialistic and communistic
demands: His religion in the pure consciousness of communion with
God. With eschatology He had nothing whatever to do, it was first interpolated
into His teaching by Matthew.
<P>
The miracles are all to be explained by suggestion and hypnotism.
At the marriage at Cana, Jesus noticed that the guests were taking too
much and therefore secretly bade the servants pour out water instead
of wine while He Himself said, "Drink, this is better wine." In this way
He succeeded in suggesting to a part of the company that they were
really drinking wine. The feeding of the multitude is explained by striking
out a couple of noughts from the numbers; the raising of Lazarus
by supposing it a case of premature burial. Jesus Himself when taken
down from the cross was not dead, and the Essenes succeeded in re-animating
Him. His work is inspired with hatred against Catholicism,
but with a real reverence for Jesus.
<P>
Another mere variant of the plan of Venturini is the fictitious Life of
Jesus of Pierre Nahor. [1] The sentimental descriptions of nature and the
long dialogues characteristic of the Lives of Jesus of a hundred years
ago are here again in full force. After John had already begun to preach
in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, Jesus, in company with a distinguished
Brahmin who possessed property at Nazareth and had an
influential following in Jerusalem, made a journey to Egypt and was
there indoctrinated into all kinds of Egyptian, Essene, and Indian philosophy,
thus giving the author, or rather the authoress, an opportunity
to develop her ideas on the philosophy of religion in didactic dialogues.
When He soon afterwards begins to work in Galilee the young teacher is
much aided by the fact that, at the instance of His fellow-traveller, He
had acquired from Egyptian mendicants a practical acquaintance with
the secrets of hypnotism. By His skill He healed Mary of Magdala, a
distinguished courtesan of Tiberias. They had met before at Alexandria.
After being cured she left Tiberias and went to live in a small house,
inherited from her mother, at Magdala.
<P>
Jesus Himself never went to Tiberias, but the social world of that
place took an interest in Him, and often had itself rowed to the beach
when He was preaching. Rich and pious ladies used to inquire of Him
where He thought of preaching to the people on a given day, and sent

[1] Pierre Nahor (Emilie Lerou), <i>Jesus</i>. Translated from the French by Walter
Bloch. Berlin, 1905. Its motto is: The figure of Jesus belongs, like all mysterious,
heroic, or mythical figures, to legend and poetry. In the introduction we find the
statement, "This book is a confession of faith." The narrative is based on the
Fourth Gospel.

<P>
baskets of bread and dried fish to the spot which He indicated, that the
multitude might not suffer hunger. This is the explanation of the stories
about the feeding of the multitudes; the people had no idea whence
Jesus suddenly obtained the supplies which He caused His disciples to
distribute.
<P>
When he became aware that the priests had resolved upon His death,
He made His friend Joseph of Arimathea, a leading man among the
Essenes, promise that he would take Him down from the cross as soon
as possible and lay Him in the grave without other witnesses. Only
Nicodemus was to be present. On the cross He put Himself into a cataleptic
trance; He was taken down from the cross seemingly dead, and
came to Himself again in the grave. After appearing several times to
His disciples he set out for Nazareth and dragged His way painfully
thither. With a last effort He reaches the house of His mysterious old
Indian teacher. At the door He falls helpless, just as the morning dawns.
The old slave-woman recognises Him and carries Him into the house,
where He dies. "The serene solemn night withdrew and day broke in
blinding splendour behind Tiberias."
<P>
Nikolas Notowitsch [1] finds in Luke i. 80 ("And the child grew . . .
and was in the deserts until the day of his shewing unto Israel") a "gap
in the life of Jesus," in spite of the fact that this passage refers to the
Baptist, and proposes to fill it by putting Jesus to school with the
Brahmins and Buddhists from His thirteenth to His twenty-ninth year.
As evidence for this he refers to statements about Buddhist worship of
a certain Issa which he professes to have found in the monasteries of
Little Thibet. The whole thing is, as was shown by the experts, a bare-faced
swindle and an impudent invention.
<P>
To the fictitious Lives of Jesus belong also in the main the theosophical
"Lives," which equally play fast and loose with the history,

pp. See Holtzmann in the <i>Theol. Jahresbericht</i>, xiv. p. 140.
<P>
In a certain limited sense the work of A. Lillie, <i>The Influence of Buddhism on
Primitive Christianity</i> (London, 1893), is to be numbered among the fictitious works
on the life of Jesus. The fictitious element consists in Jesus being made an Essene
by the writer, and Essenism equated with Buddhism.
<P>
Among "edifying" romances on the life of Jesus intended for family reading,
that of the English writer J. H. Ingraham, <i>The Prince of the House of David</i>
has had a very long lease of life. It appeared in a German translation as early as
1858, and was reissued in 1906 (Brunswick).
<P>
A fictitious life of Jesus of wonderful beauty is Peter Rosegger's <i>I.N.R.I. Frohe
Botschaft sines armen Sunders</i> (The Glad Tidings of a poor Sinner). Leipzig, 6th-10th thousand,
1906. 293 pp.                                            ,  ^

A feminine point of view reveals itself in C. Ranch's <i>Jeschua ben Joseph,

though here with a view to proving that Jesus had absorbed the Egyptian
and Indian theosophy, and had been indoctrinated with "occult science."
The theosophists, however, have the advantage of escaping the dilemma
between reanimation after a trance and resurrection, since they are
convinced that it was possible for Jesus to reassume His body after
He had really died. But in the touching up and embellishment of the
Gospel narratives they out-do even the romancers.
<P>
Ernest Bosc, [1] writing as a theosophist, makes it the chief aim of his
work to describe the oriental origin of Christianity, and ventures to
assert that Jesus was not a Semite, but an Aryan. The Fourth Gospel is,
of course, the basis of his representation. He does not hesitate, however,
to appeal also to the anonymous "Revelations" published in 1849, which
are a mere plagiarism from Venturini.
<P>
A work which is written with some ability and with much out-of-the-way
learning is "Did Jesus live 100 B.C.?" [2] The author compares the
Christian tradition with the Jewish, and finds in the latter a reminiscence
of a Jesus who lived in the time of Alexander Jannaeus (104-76 B.C.).
This person was transferred by the earliest Evangelist to the later period,
the attempt being facilitated by the fact that during the procuratorship
of Pilate a false prophet had attracted some attsntion. The author, however,
only professes to offer it as a hypothesis, and apologises in advance
for the offence which it is likely to cause.

tradition concerning Jesus, is offered by S. Krauss, <i>Das Leben Jesu nach judischen

writing in the fifth century, and he is of opinion that the Jewish legend is only a
modified version of the Christian tradition.
