SO LONG AS IT WAS MERELY A QUESTION OF ESTABLISHING THE DISTINCTIVE
character of the thought of Jesus as compared with the ancient prophetic
and Danielic conceptions, and so long as the only available storehouse
of Rabbinic and Late-Jewish ideas was Lightfoot's <i>Horae Hebraicae et
Talmudicae in quatuor Evangelistas</i>, [1] it was still possible to cherish
the belief that the preaching of Jesus could be conceived as something
which was, in the last analysis, independent of all contemporary ideas.
But after the studies of Hilgenfeld and Dillmann [2] had made known the
Jewish apocalyptic in its fundamental characteristics, and the Jewish
pseudepigrapha were no longer looked on as "forgeries," but as representative
documents of the last stage of Jewish thought, the necessity of
taking account of them in interpreting the thought of Jesus became more

<P>
and more emphatic. Almost two decades were to pass, however, before
the full significance of this material was realised.
<P>
It might almost have seemed as if it was to meet this attack by anticipation
that Colani wrote in 1864 his work, <i>Jesus-Christ et les croyances
messianiques de son temps.</i>
<P>
Timothee Colani was born in 1824 at Leme (Aisne), studied in
Strassburg and became pastor there in 1851. In the year 1864 he was
appointed Professor of Pastoral Theology in Strassburg in spite of some
attempted opposition to the appointment on the part of the orthodox
party in Paris, which was then growing in strength. The events of the
year 1870 left him without a post. As he had no prospect of being called
to a pastorate in France, he became a merchant. In consequence of some
unfortunate business operations he lost all his property. In 1875 he
obtained a post as librarian at the Sorbonne. He died in 1888.
<P>
How far was Jesus a Jew? That was the starting-point of Colani's
study. According to him there was a complete lack of homogeneity in
the Messianic hopes cherished by the Jewish people in the time of
Jesus, since the prophetic conception, according to which the Kingdom
of the Messiah belonged to the present world-order, and the apocalyptic,
which transferred it to the future age, had not yet been brought into
any kind of unity. The general expectation was focused rather upon the
Forerunner than upon the Messiah. Jesus Himself in the first period of
His public ministry, up to Mark viii., had never designated Himself
as the Messiah, for the expression Son of Man carried no Messianic associations
for the multitude. His fundamental thought was that of perfect
communion with God; only little by little, as the success of the preaching
of the Kingdom more and more impressed His mind, did His consciousness
take on a Messianic colouring. In face of the undisciplined
expectations of the people He constantly repeats in His parables of the
growth of the Kingdom, the word "patience." By revealing Himself as
the Lord of this spiritual kingdom He makes an end of the oscillation
between the sensuous and the spiritual in the current expectations of the
future blessedness. He points to mankind as a whole, not merely to the
chosen people, as the people of the Kingdom, and substitutes for the
apocalyptic catastrophe an organic development. By His interpretation
of Psalm ex., in Mark xii. 35-37, He makes known that the Messiah has
nothing whatever to do with the Davidic kingship. It was only with
difficulty that He came to resolve to accept the title of Messiah; He knew
what a weight of national prejudices and national hopes hung upon it.
<P>
But He is "Messiah the Son of Man"; He created this expression in
order thereby to make known His lowliness. In the moment in which
He accepted the office He registered the resolve to suffer. His purpose is,
to be the suffering, not the triumphant, Messiah. It is to the influence
<P>
<center>225</center>
<P>
which His Passion exercises upon the souls of men that He looks for
the firm establishment of His Kingdom.
<P>
This spiritual conception of the Kingdom cannot possibly be combined
with the thought of a glorious Second Coming, for if Jesus had
held this latter view He must necessarily have thought of the present
life as only a kind of prologue to that second existence. Neither the
Jewish, nor the Jewish-Christian eschatology as represented in the
eschatological discourses in the Gospels, can, therefore, in Colani's
opinion, belong to the preaching of Jesus. That He should sometimes
have made use of the imagery associated with the Jewish expectations
of the future is, of course, only natural. But the eschatology occupies
far too important a place in the tradition of the preaching of Jesus to
be explained as a mere symbolical mode of expression. It forms a substantial element of that preaching. A spiritualisation of it will not meet
the case. Therefore, if the conviction has been arrived at on other
grounds that Jesus' preaching did not follow the lines of Jewish eschatology, there is only one possible way of dealing with it, and that is
by excising it from the text on critical grounds.
<P>
The only element in the preaching of Jesus which can, in Colani's
opinion, be called in any sense "eschatological" was the conviction that
there would be a wide extension of the Gospel even within the existing
generation, that Gentiles should be admitted to the Kingdom, and that
in consequence of the general want of receptivity towards the message
of salvation, judgment should come upon the nations.
<P>
These views of Colani furnish him with a basis upon which to decide
on the genuineness or otherwise of the eschatological discourses.
Among the sayings put into the mouth of Jesus which must be rejected
as impossible are: the promise, in the discourse at the sending forth of
the Twelve, of the imminent coming of the Son of Man, Matt. x. 23;
the promise to the disciples that they should sit upon twelve thrones
judging the tribes of Israel, Matt. xix. 28; the saying about His return
in Matt. xxiii. 39; the final eschatological saying at the Last Supper,
Matt. xxvi. 29, "the Papias-like Chiliasm of which is unworthy of
Jesus"; and the prediction of His coming on the clouds of heaven with
which He closes His Messianic confession before the Council. The
apocalyptic discourses in Mark xiii., Matt. xxiv., and Luke xxi. are
interpolated. A Jewish-Christian apocalypse of the first century, probably
composed before the destruction of Jerusalem, has been interwoven
with a short exhortation which Jesus gave on the occasion when He
predicted the destruction of the temple.
<P>
According to Colani, therefore, Jesus did not expect to come again
from Heaven to complete His work. It was completed by His death, and
the purpose of the coming of the Spirit was to make manifest its com-
<P>
<center>226</center>
<P>
pletion. Strauss and Renan had entered upon the path of explaining
Jesus' preaching from the history of the time by the assumption of an
intermixture in it of Jewish ideas, but it was now recognized "that this
path is a cul-de-sac, and that criticism must turn round and get out
of it as quickly as possible."
<P>
The new feature of Colani's view was not so much the uncompromising
rejection of eschatology as the clear recognition that its rejection was
not a matter to be disposed of in a phrase or two, but necessitated a
critical analysis of the text.
<P>
The systematic investigation of the Synoptic apocalypse was a contribution
to criticism of the utmost importance.
<P>
In the year 1882 Volkmar took up this attempt afresh, at least in its
main features. [1] His construction rests upon two main points of support;
upon his view of the sources and his conception of the eschatology
of the time of Jesus. In his view the sole source for the Life of Jesus is
the Gospel of Mark, which was "probably written exactly in the year
73," five years after the Johannine apocalypse.
<P>
The other two of the first three Gospels belong to the second century,
and can only be used by way of supplement. Luke dates from the beginning
of the first decade of the century; while Matthew is regarded by
Volkmar, as by Wilke, as being a combination of Mark and Luke, and
is relegated to the end of this first decade. The work is in his opinion
a revision of the Gospel tradition "in the spirit of that primitive Christianity which, while constantly opposing the tendency of the apostle of
the Gentiles to make light of the Law, was nevertheless so far universalistic that, starting from the old legal ground, it made the first steps
towards a catholic unity." Once Matthew has been set aside in this way,
the literary elimination of the eschatology follows as a matter of course;
the much smaller element of discourse in Mark can offer no serious resistance.
<P>
As regards the Messianic expectations of the time, they were, in Volkmar's opinion, such that Jesus could not possibly have come forward
with Messianic claims. The Messianic Son of Man, whose aim was to

Leben Jesu</i>. (Mark and Synoptic Material in the Gospels, according to the original
text; and the historical elements in the Life of Jesus.) Zurich, 1869; 2nd edition,
1876, 738 pp. Volkmar was born in 1809, and was living at Fulda as a Gymnasium
(High School) teacher, when in 1852 he was arrested by the Hessian Government on
account of his political views, and subsequently deprived of his post. In 1853 he
went to Zurich, where a new prospect opened to him as a Docent in theology. He
died in 1893.
<P>
<center>227</center>
<P>
found a super-earthly Kingdom, only arose in Judaism under the influence of Christian dogma. The contemporaries of Jesus knew only
the political ideal of the Messianic King. And woe to any one who conjured up these hopes! The Baptist had done so by his too fervent preachine about repentance and the Kingdom, and had been promptly put
out of the way by the Tetrarch. The version found even in Mark, which
represents that it was on Herodias' account, and at her daughter's petition, that John was beheaded, is a later interpretation which, according
to Volkmar, is evidently false on chronological grounds, since the Baptist was dead before Herod took Herodias as his wife. Had Jesus desired
the Messiahship, He could only have claimed it in this political sense.
The alternative is to suppose that He did not desire it.
<P>
Volkmar's contribution to the subject consists in the formulating of
this clean-cut alternative. Colani had indeed recognised the alternative,
but had not taken up a consistent attitude in regard to it. Here, that
way of escape from the difficulty is barred, which suggests that Jesus
set Himself up as Messiah, but in another than the popular sense. What
may be called Jesus' Messianic consciousness consisted solely "in knowing Himself to be first-born among many brethren, the Son of God after
the Spirit, and consequently feeling Himself enabled and impelled to
bring about that regeneration of His people which alone could make
it worthy of deliverance." It is in any case clearly evident from Paul,
from the Apocalypse, and from Mark, "the three documentary witnesses
emanating from the circle of the followers of Jesus during the first
century, that it was only after His crucifixion that Jesus was hailed as
the Christ; never during His earthly life." The elimination of the eschatology thus leads also to the elimination of the Messiahship of Jesus.
<P>
If we are told in Mark viii. 29 that Simon Peter was the first among
men to hail Jesus as the Messiah, it is to be noticed, Volkmar points
out, that the Evangelist places this confession at a time when Jesus'
work was over and the thought of His Passion first appears; and if
we desire fully to understand the author's purpose we must fix our
attention on the Lord's command not to make known His Messiahship
until after His resurrection (Mark viii. 30, ix. 9 and 10), which is a
hint that we are to date Jesus' Messiahship from His death. For Mark is
no mere naive chronicler, but a conscious artist interpreting the history;
sometimes, indeed, a powerful epic writer in whose work the historical
and the poetic are intermingled.
<P>
Thus the conclusion is that Mark, in agreement with Paul, represents
Jesus as becoming the Messiah only as a consequence of His resurrection. He really appeared, and His first appearance was to Peter. When
Peter on that night of terror fled from Jerusalem to take refuge in
Galilee, Jesus, according to the mystic prediction of Mark xiv. 28 and
<P>
<center>228</center>
<P>
xvi. 7, went before him. "He was constantly present to his spirit, until
on the third day He manifested Himself before his eyes, in the heavenly
appearance which was also vouchsafed to the last of the apostles 'as he
was in the way'-and Peter, enraptured, gave expression to the clear
conviction with which the whole life of Jesus had inspired him in the
cry 'Thou art the Christ.'"
<P>
The historical Jesus therefore founded a community of followers
without advancing any claims to the Messiahship. He desired only to be
a reformer; the spiritual deliverer of the people of God, to realise upon
earth the Kingdom of God which they were all seeking in the beyond,
and to extend the reign of God over all nations. "The Kingdom of God
is doubtless to win its final and decisive victory by the almighty aid of
God; our duty is to see to its beginnings"-that is, according to Volkmar, the lesson which Jesus teaches us in the parable of the Sower. The
ethic of this Kingdom was not yet confused by any eschatological ideas.
It was only when, as the years went on, the expectation of the Parousia
rose to a high pitch of intensity that "marriage and the bringing up of
children came to be regarded as superfluous, and were consequently
thought of as signs of an absorption in earthly interests which was out
of harmony with the near approach to the goal of these hopes." Jesus
had renewed the foundations on which "the family" was based and had
made it, in turn, a corner stone of the Kingdom of God, even as He had
consecrated the common meal by making it a love feast.
<P>
In most things Jesus was conservative. The ritual worship of the
God of Israel remained for Him always a sacred thing. But in spite
of that He withdrew more and more from the synagogue, the scene of
His earliest preaching, and taught in the houses of His disciples. "He
had learned to fulfil the law as implicit in one highest commandment
and supreme principle, therefore 'in spirit and in truth'; but He never,
as appears from all the evidence, declared it to be abolished." "We may
be equally certain, however, that Jesus, while He asserted the abiding
validity of the Ten Commandments, never explicitly declared that of the
Mosaic Law as a whole. The absence of any such saying from the tradition regarding Jesus made it possible for Paul to take his decisive step
forward."
<P>
As regards the Gospel discourses about the Parousia, it is easy to
recognise that, even in Mark, these "are one and all the work of the
narrator, whose purpose is edification. He connects his work as closely
as possible with the Apocalypse, which had appeared some five years
earlier, in order to emphasize, in contrast to it, the higher truth." Jesus'
own hope, in all its clearness and complete originality, is recorded in the
parables of the seed growing secretly and the grain of mustard seed,
and in the saying about the immortality of His words. Nothing beyond
<P>
<center>229</center>
<P>
this is in any way certain, however remarkable the saying in Mark ix. 1
may be, that the looked-for consummation is to take place during the
lifetime of the existing generation.
<P>
"It is only the fact that Mark is preceded by 'the book of the Birth
(and History) of Christ according to Matthew'-not only in the Scriptures,
but also in men's minds, which were dominated by it as the 'first
Gospel'-which has caused it to be taken as self-evident that Jesus,
knowing Himself from the first to be the Messiah, expected His Parousia
solely from heaven, and therefore with, or in, the clouds of heaven. . . .
But since He who was thought of as by birth the Son of God, is now
thought of as the Son of Man, born an Israelite, and becoming the Son
of God after the spirit only at His baptism, the hope that looks to the
clouds of heaven cannot be, or at least ought not to be, any longer explained
otherwise than as an enthusiastic dream."
<P>
If, even at the beginning of the 'eighties, a so extreme theory on the
other side could, without opposition, occupy all the points of vantage,
it is evident that the theory which gave eschatology its due place was
making but slow progress. It was not that any one had been disputing
the ground with it, but that all its operations were characterised by a
nervous timidity. And these hesitations are not to be laid to the account
of those who did not perceive the approach of the decisive conflict, or
refused to accept battle, like the followers of Reuss, for instance, who
were satisfied with the hypothesis that thoughts about the Last Judgment
had forced their way into the authentic discourses of Jesus about the
destruction of the city; [1] even those who like Weiffenbach are fully
convinced that "the eschatological question, and in particular the question
of the Second Coming, which in many quarters has up to the present
been treated as a noli me tangere, must sooner or later become the
battle-ground of the greatest and most decisive of theological controversies"-even
those who shared this conviction stopped half-way on the
road on which they had entered.
<P>
Weiffenbach's [2] work, "Jesus' Conception of His Second Coming,"
published in 1873, sums up the results of the previous discussions of the
saliect. He names as among those who ascribe the expectation of the
Parousia, in the sensuous form in which it meets us in the documents, to
a misunderstanding of the teaching of Jesus on the part of the disciples

and the writers who were dependent upon them-Schleiermaeher, Bleek,
Holtzmann, Schenkel, Colani, Baur, Hase, and Meyer. Among those who
maintained that the Parousia formed an integral part of Jesus' teaching,
he cites Keim, Weizsacker, Strauss, and Renan. He considers that the
readiest way to advance the discussion will be by undertaking a critical
review of the attempt to analyse the great Synoptic discourse about the
future in which Colani had led the way.
<P>
The question of the Parousia is like, Weiffenbach suggests, a vessel
which has become firmly wedged between rocks. Any attempt to get it
afloat again will be useless until a new channel is found for it. His detailed
discussions are devoted to endeavouring to discover the relation
between the declarations regarding the Second Coming and the predictions
of the Passion. In the course of his analysis of the great prophetic
discourse he rejects the suggestion made by Weisse in his <i>Evangelienfrage</i>
of 1856, that the eschatological character of the discourse results
from the way in which it is put together; that while the sayings in their
present mosaic-like combination certainly have a reference to the last
things, each of them individually in its original context might well bear
a natural sense. In Colani's hypothesis of conflation the suggestion was
to be rejected that it was not "Ur-Markus," but the author of the Synoptic apocalypse who was responsible for the working in of the "Little
Apocalypse." [1] It was an unsatisfactory feature of Weizsacker's position [2] that he insisted on regarding the "Littel Apocalypse" as Jewish,
not Jewish-Christian; Pfleiderer had distinguished sharply what belongs
to the Evangelist from the "Little Apocalypse," and had sought to prove
that the purpose of the Evangelist in thus breaking up the latter and
working it into a discourse of Jesus was to tone down the eschatological
hopes expressed in the discourse, because they had remained unfulfilled
even at the fall of Jerusalem, and to retard the rapid development of the
apocalyptic process by inserting between its successive phases passages
from a different discourse. [3] Weiffenbach carries this series of tentative
suggestions to its logical conclusion, advancing the view that the link
of connexion between the Jewish-Christian Apocalypse and the Gospel
material in which it is imbedded is the thought of the Second Coming.
<P>
[1] The English reader will find a constructive analysis of what is known as the
"Little Apocalypse" in Encyclopaedia Biblica, art. "Gospels," col. 1857. It con-
sists of the verses Matt. xxiv. 6-8, 15-22, 29-31, 34, corresponding to Mark xiii.
7-9ff, 14-20, 24-27, 30. According to the theory first sketched by Colani these verses
formed an independent Apocalypse which was embedded ia the Gospel by the
Evangelist-F. C. B.

<P>
This was the thought which gave the impulse from without towards the
transmutation of Jewish into Jewish-Christian eschatology. Jesus must
have given expression to the thought of His near return; and Jewish-
Christianity subsequently painted it over with the colours of Jewish
eschatology.
<P>
In developing this theory, Weiffenbach thought that he had succeeded
in solving the problem which had been first critically formulated by
Keim, who is constantly emphasising the idea that the eschatological
hopes of the disciples could not be explained merely from their Judaic
pre-suppositions, but that some incentive to the formation of these
hopes must be sought in the preaching of Jesus; otherwise primitive
Christianity and the life of Jesus would stand side by side unconnected
and unexplained, and in that case we must give up all hope "of distinguishing the sure word of the Lord from Israel's restless speculations
about the future."
<P>
When the Jewish-Christian Apocalypse has been eliminated, we arrive
at a discourse, spoken on the Mount of Olives, in which Jesus exhorted
His disciples to watchfulness, in view of the near, but nevertheless undefined, hour of the return of "the Master of the House."
<P>
In this discourse, therefore, we have a standard by which criticism
may test all the eschatological sayings and discourses. Weiffenbach has
the merit of having gathered together all the eschatological material of
the Synoptics and examined it in the light of a definite principle. In
Colani the material was incomplete, and instead of a critical principle
he offered only an arbitrary exegesis which permitted him, for example,
to conceive the watchfulness on which the eschatological parables constantly insist as only a vivid expression for the sense of responsibility
"which weighs upon the life of man."
<P>
And yet the outcome of this attempt of Weiffenbach's, which begins
with so much real promise, is in the end wholly unsatisfactory. The
"authentic thought of the return" which he takes as his standard has
for its sole content the expectation of a visible personal return in the
"ear future "free from all more or less fantastic apocalyptic and JewishChristian speculations about the future." That is to say, the whole of the
eschatological discourses of Jesus are to be judged by the standard of
a colourless, unreal figment of theology. Whatever cannot be squared
"ith that is to be declared spurious and cut away! Accordingly the
eschatological closing saying at the Last Supper is stigmatised as a
Chiliastic-Capernaitic" [1] distortion of a "normal" promise of the Second Coming; the idea of the <font face="Symbol">paliggenesia</font>, Matt. xix. 28, is said to be
wholly foreign to Jesus' world of thought; it is impossible, too, that
<P>
[1] By "Capernaitic" 'Weiffenbach apparently means literalistic; cf. John vi. 52 f.
<P>
<center>232</center>
<P>
Jesus can have thought of Himself as the Judge of the world, for the
Jewish and Jewish-Christian eschatology does not ascribe the conduct
of the Last Judgment to the Messiah; that is first done by Gentile Christians, and especially by Paul. It was, therefore, the later eschatology
which set the Son of Man on the throne of His glory and prepared
"the twelve thrones of judgment for the disciples." The historian ought
only to admit such of the sayings about bearing rule in the Messianic
Kingdom as can be interpreted in a spiritual, non-sensuous fashion.
<P>
In the end Weiffenbach's critical principle proves to be merely a
bludgeon with which he goes seal-hunting and clubs the defenceless
Synoptic sayings right and left. When his work is done you see before
you a desert island strewn with quivering corpses. Nevertheless the
slaughter was not aimless, or at least it was not without result.
<P>
In the first place, it did really appear, as a by-product of the critical
processes, that Jesus' discourses about the future had nothing to do
with an historical prevision of the destruction of Jerusalem, whereas
the supposition that they had, had hitherto been taken as self-evident,
the prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem being regarded as the
historic nucleus of Jesus' discourses regarding the future, to which the
idea of the Last Judgment had subsequently attached itself.
<P>
Here, then, we have the introduction of the converse opinion, which
was subsequently established as correct; namely, that Jesus foresaw,
indeed, the Last Judgment, but not the historical destruction of Jerusalem.
<P>
In the next place, in the course of his critical examination of the
eschatological material, Weiffenbach stumbles upon the discourse at the
sending forth of the Twelve in Matt. x., and finds himself face to face
with the fact that the discourse which he was expected to regard as a
discourse of instruction was really nothing of the kind, but a collection
of eschatological sayings. As he had taken over along with the Marcan
hypothesis the closely connected view of the composite character of the
Synoptic discourses, he does not allow himself to be misled, but regards this inappropriate charge to the Twelve as nothing else than an
impossible anticipation and a bold anachronism. He knows that he is
at one in this with Holtzmann, Colani, Bleek, Scholten, Meyer, and
Keim, who also made the discourse of instruction end at the point beyond which they find it impossible to explain it, and regard the predictions of persecution as only possible in the later period of the hf6
of Jesus. "For these predictions," to express Weiffenbach's view in the
words of Keim, "are too much at variance with the essentially gracious
and happy mood which suggested the sending forth of the disciples'
and reflect instead the lurid gloom of the fierce conflicts of the later
period and the sadness of the farewell discourses."
<P>
<center>233</center>
<P>
It was a good thing that Bruno Bauer did not hear this chorus. If he
had, he would have asked Weiffenbach and his allies whether the poor
fragment that remained after the critical dissection of the "charge to
the Twelve" was "a discourse of instruction," and if in view of these
difficulties they could not realise why he had refused, thirty years before,
to believe in the "discourse of instruction." But Bruno Bauer heard
nothing; and so their blissful unconsciousness lasted for nearly a generation longer.
<P>
The expectation of His Second Coming, repeatedly expressed by
Jesus towards the close of His life, is on this hypothesis authentic; it
was painted over by the primitive Christian community with the colours
of its own eschatology, in consequence of the delay of the Parousia; and
in view of the mission to the Gentiles a more cautious conception of the
nearness of the time commended itself; nay, when Jerusalem had fallen
and the "signs of the end" which had been supposed to be discovered in
the horrors of the years 68 and 69 had passed without result, the return of Jesus was relegated to a distant future by the aid of the doctrine
that the Gospel must first be preached to all the heathen. Thus the
Parousia, which according to the Jewish-Christian eschatology belonged
to the present age, was transferred to the future. "With this combination
and making coincident-they were not so at the first-of the Second
Coming, the end of the world, and the final Judgment, the idea of the
Second Coming reached the last and highest stage of its development."
<P>
Weiffenbach's view, as we have seen, empties Jesus' expectation of
His return of almost all its content, and to that is due the fact that his
investigation did not prove so useful as it might have done. His purpose
is, following suggestions thrown out by Schleiermacher and Wiesse, to
prove the identity of the predictions of the Second Coming and of the
Resurrection, and he takes as his starting-point the observation that the
conduct of the disciples after the death of Jesus forbids us to suppose
that the Resurrection had been predicted in clear and unambiguous sayings, and that, on the other hand, the announcement of the Second
Coming coincides in point of time with the predictions of the Resurrection, and the predictions buih of the Second Coming and of the Resurrection stand in organic connexion with the announcement of His approaching death. The two are therefore identical.
<P>
It was only after the death of their Master that the disciples differentiated the thought of the Resurrection from that of the Second Coming.
The Resurrection did not bring them that which the Second Coming
had promised; but it produced the result that the eschatological hopes,
^hich Jesus had with difficulty succeeded in damping, flamed up again
in the hearts of His disciples. The spiritual presence of the Deliverer
^ho had manifested Himself to them did not seem to them to be the
<P>
<center>234</center>
<P>
fulfilment of the promise of the Second Coming; but the expectation
of the latter, being brought into contact with the flame of eschatological
hope with which their hearts were a-fire, was fused, and cast into a form
quite different from that in which it had been derived from the words
of Jesus.
<P>
That is all finely observed. For the first time it had dawned upon
historical criticism that the great question is that concerning the identity
or difference of the Parousia and the Resurrection. But the man who
had been the first to grasp that thought, and who had undertaken his
whole study with the special purpose of working it out, was too much
under the influence of the spiritualised eschatology of Schleiermacher
and Weisse to be able to assign the right values in the solution of his
equation. And, withal, he is too much inclined to play the apologist as
a subsidiary role. He is not content merely to render the history intelligible; he is, by his own confession, urged on by the hope that perhaps a way may be found of causing that "error" of Jesus to disappear
and proving it to be an illusion due to the want of a sufficiently close
study of His discourses. But the historian simply must not be an
apologist; he must leave that to those who come after him and he may
do so with a quiet mind, for the apologists, as we learn from the history
of the Lives of Jesus, can get the better of any historical result whatever.
It is, therefore, quite unnecessary that the historian should allow himself
to be led astray by following an apologetic will-o'-the-wisp.
<P>
Technically regarded, the mistake on which Weiffenbach's investigation made shipwreck was the failure to bring the Jewish apocalyptic
material into relation with the Synoptic data. If he had done this, it
would have been impossible for him to extract an absolutely unreal and
unhistorical conception of the Second Coming out of the discourses of
Jesus.
<P>
The task which Weiffenbach had neglected remained undone-to the
detriment of theology-until Baldensperger 1 repaired the omission. His
book, "The Self-consciousness of Jesus in the Light of the Messianic
Hopes of His Time," 2 published in 1888, made its impression by reason
of the fullness of its material. Whereas Colani and Volkmar had still

consequence of the polemic against opponents who had arisen in the meantime lt

<P>
been able to deny the existence of a fully formed Messianic expectation
in the time of Jesus, the genesis of the expectation was now fully traced
out, and it was shown that the world of thought which meets us in Daniel
had won the victory, that the "Son of Man" Messiah of the Similitudes
of Enoch was the last product of the Messianic hope prior to the time
of Jesus; and that therefore the fully developed Danielic scheme with
its unbridgeable chasm between the present and the future world furnished
the outline within which all further and more detailed traits were
inserted. The honour of having effectively pioneered the way for this
discovery belongs to Schurer. [1] Baldensperger adopts his ideas, but sets
them forth in a much more direct way, because he, in contrast with
Schurer, gives no system of Messianic expectation-and there never in
reality was a system-but is content to picture its many-sided growth.
<P>
He does not, it is true, escape some minor inconsistencies. For example,
the idea of a "political Messiahship," which is really set aside
by his historical treatment, crops up here and there, as though the author
had not entirely got rid of it himself. But the impression made by
the book as a whole was overpowering.
<P>
Nevertheless this book does not exactly fulfil the promise of its title,
any more than Weiffenbach's. The reader expects that now at last Jesus'
sayings about Himself will be consistently explained in the light of the
Jewish Messianic ideas, but that is not done. For Baldensperger,
instead of tracing down and working out the conception of the Kingdom
of God held by Jesus as a product of the Jewish eschatology, at least
by way of trying whether that method would suffice, takes it over direct
from modern historical theology. He assumes as self-evident that Jesus'
conception of the Kingdom of God had a double character, that the
eschatological and spiritual elements were equally represented in it and
mutually conditioned one another, and that Jesus therefore began, in
pursuance of this conception, to found a spiritual invisible Kingdom, al-

The latest presentment of Jewish apocalyptic is <i>Die judische Eschatologie van

material is very completely given. Unfortunately the author has chosen the systematic
method of treating his subject, instead of tracing the history of its development,
the only right way. As a consequence Jesus and Paul occupy far too little space
ln this survey of Jewish apocalyptic. For a treatment of the origin of Jewish
eschatology from the point of view of the history of religion see Hugo Gressmann,
now Professor at Berlin, <i>Der Ursprung der israelitisch-judischen Eschatologie</i> (The
Origin of the Israelitish and Jewish Eschatology</i>), Gottingen, 1905. 377 pp.
<P>
<center>236</center>
<P>
though He expected its fulfilment to be effected by supernatural means.
Consequently there must also have been a duality in His religious consciousness, in which these two conceptions had to be combined. Jesus'
Messianic consciousness sprang, according to Baldensperger, "from
a religious root"; that is to say, the Messianic consciousness was a special modification of a self-consciousness in which a pure, spiritual,
unique relation to God was the fundamental element; and from this
arises the possibility of a spiritual transformation of the Jewish-Messianic self-consciousness. In making these assumptions, Baldensperger
does not ask himself whether it is not possible that for Jesus the purely
Jewish consciousness of a transcendental Messiahship may itself have
been religious, nay even spiritual, just as well as the Messiahship resting on a vague, indefinite, colourless sense of union with God which
modern theologians arbitrarily attribute to Him.
<P>
Again, instead of arriving at the two conceptions, Kingdom of God
and Messianic consciousness, purely empirically, by an unbiased comparison of the Synoptic passages with the Late-Jewish conceptions,
Baldensperger, in this following Holtzmann, brings them into his theory
in the dual form in which contemporary theology, now becoming faintly
tinged with eschatology, offered them to him. Consequently, everything
has to be adapted to this duality. Jesus, for example, in applying to
Himself the title Son of Man, thinks not only of the transcendental significance which it has in the Jewish apocalyptic, but gives it at the same
time an ethico-religious colouring.
<P>
Finally, the duality is explained by an application of the genetic
method, in which the "course of the development of the self-consciousness of Jesus" is traced out. The historical psychology of the Marcan
hypothesis here shows its power of adapting itself to eschatology. From
the first, to follow the course of Baldensperger's exposition, the eschatological view influenced Jesus' expectation of the Kingdom and His
Messianic consciousness. In the wilderness, after the dawn of His Messianic consciousness at His baptism, He had rejected the ideal of the
Messianic king of David's line and put away all warlike thoughts. Then
He began to found the Kingdom of God by preaching. For a time the
spiritualised idea of the Kingdom was dominant in His mind, the Messianic eschatological idea falling rather into the background.
<P>
But His silence regarding His Messianic office was partly due to
paedagogic reasons, "since He desired to lead His hearers to a more
spiritual conception of the Kingdom and so to obviate a possible political movement on their part and the consequent intervention of the
Roman government." In addition to this He had also personal reasons
for not revealing Himself which only disappeared in the moment when
His death and Second Coming became part of His plan; previous to
<P>
<center>237</center>
<P>
that He did not know how and when the Kingdom was to come. Prior
to the confession at Caesarea Philippi, the disciples "had only a faint
and vague suspicion of the Messianic dignity of their Master."
<P>
This was "rather the preparatory stage of His Messianic work." Objectively, it may be described "as the period of growing emphasis upon
the spiritual characteristics of the Kingdom, and of resigned waiting
and watching for its outward manifestation in glory; subjectively, from
the point of view of the self-consciousness of Jesus, it may be characterised as the period of the struggle between His religious conviction
of His Messiahship and the traditional rationalistic Messianic belief."
<P>
This first period opens out into a second in which He had attained to
perfect clearness of vision and complete inner harmony. By the acceptance of the idea of suffering, Jesus' inner peace is enhanced to the
highest degree conceivable. "By throwing Himself upon the thought of
death He escaped the lingering uncertainty as to when and how God
would fulfil His promise. . . ." "The coming of the Kingdom was fixed
down to the Second Coming of the Messiah. Now He ventured to regard
Himself as the Son of Man who was to be the future Judge of the world,
for the suffering and dying Son of Man was closely associated with the
Son of Man surrounded by the host of heaven. Would the people accept
Him as Messiah? He now, in Jerusalem, put the question to them in all
its sharpness and burning actuality; and the people were moved to
enthusiasm. But so soon as they saw that He whom they had hailed with
such acclamation was neither able nor willing to fulfil their ambitious
dreams, a reaction set in."
<P>
Thus, according to Baldensperger, there was an interaction between
the historical and the psychological events. And that is right!-if only
the machinery were not so complicated, and a "development" had not
to be ground out of it at whatever cost. But this, and the whole manner
of treatment in the second part, encumbered as it is with parenthetic
qualifications, was rendered inevitable by the adoption of the two aforesaid not purely historical conceptions. Sometimes, too, one gets the impression that the author felt that he owed it to the school to which he
belonged to advance no assertion without adding the limitations which
scientifically secure it against attack. Thus on every page he digs himself
into an entrenched position, with palisades of footnotes-in fact the
book actually ends with a footnote. But the conception which underlay
the whole was so full of vigour that in spite of the thoughts not being
always completely worked out, it produced a powerful impression.
Baldensperger had persuaded theology at least to admit the hypothesis-whether it took up a positive or negative position in regard to it-that Jesus possessed a fully-developed eschatology. He thus provided a
new basis for discussion and gave an impulse to the study of the subject
<P>
<center>238</center>
<P>
such as it had not received since the 'sixties, at least not in the same degree
of energy. Perhaps the very limitations of the work, due as they
were to its introduction of modern ideas, rendered it better adapted to
the spirit of the age, and consequently more influential, than if it had
been characterised by that rigorous maintenance of a single point of
view which was abstractly requisite for the proper treatment of the
subject. It was precisely the rejection of this rigorous consistency which
enabled it to gain ground for the cause of eschatology.
<P>
But the consistent treatment from a single point of view was bound
to come; and it came four years later. In passing from Weiffenbach and
Baldensperger to Johannes Weiss [1] the reader feels like an explorer
who after wsary wanderings through billowy seas of reed-grass at length
reaches a wooded tract, and instead of swamp feels firm ground beneath
his feet, instead of yielding rushes sees around him the steadfast trees.
At last there is an end of "qualifying clause" theology, of the "and yet,"
the "on the other hand," the "notwithstanding"! The reader had to follow
the others step by step, making his way over every footbridge and
gang-plank which they laid down, following all the meanderings in
which they indulged, and must never let go their hands if he wished to
come safely through the labyrinth of spiritual and eschatological ideas
which they supposed to be found in the thought of Jesus.
<P>
In Weiss there are none of these devious paths: "behold the land lies
before thee."
<P>
His "Preaching of Jesus concerning the Kingdom of God," [2]
published in 1892, has, on its own lines, an importance equal to that of
Strauss's first Life of Jesus. He lays down the third great alternative
which the study of the life of Jesus had to meet. The first was laid down
by Strauss: <i>either</i> purely historical or purely supernatural. The second
had been worked out by the Tubingen school and Holtzmann: <i>either</i>
Synoptic or Johannine. Now came the third: <i>either</i> eschatological or
non-eschatological!
<P>
Progress always consists in taking one or other of two alternatives, in
abandoning the attempt to combine them. The pioneers of progress have
therefore always to reckon with the law of mental inertia which manifests
itself in the majority-who always go on believing that it is possible
to combine that which can no longer be combined, and in fact
claim it as a special merit that they, in contrast with the "one-sided"

[1] Johannes Weiss, now Professor at Marburg, was born at Kiel in 1863.

prize dissertations, <i>Uber die Lehre vom Reich Gottes im Neuen Testament</i> (Concerning the Kingdom of God in the New Testament), one of them by Issel, the

<P>
writers, can do justice to the other side of the question. One must just
let them be, till their time is over, and resign oneself not to see the end
of it, since it is found by experience that the complete victory of one of
two historical alternatives is a matter of two full theological generations.
<P>
This remark is made in order to explain why the work of Johannes
Weiss did not immediately make an end of the mediating views. Another
reason perhaps was that, according to the usual canons of theological
authorship, the book was much too short-only sixty-seven pages-and
too simple to allow its full significance to be realised. And yet it is
precisely this simplicity which makes it one of the most important works
in historical theology. It seems to break a spell. It closes one epoch and
begins another.
<P>
Weiffenbach had failed to solve the problem of the Second Coming,
Baldensperger that of the Messianic consciousness of Jesus, because
both of them allowed a false conception of the Kingdom of God to keep
its place among the data. The general conception of the Kingdom was
first rightly grasped by Johannes Weiss. All modern ideas, he insists,
even in their subtlest forms, must be eliminated from it; when this is
done, we arrive at a Kingdom of God which is wholly future; as is indeed
implied by the petition in the Lord's prayer, "Thy Kingdom come."
Being still to come, it is at present purely supra-mundane. It is present
only as a cloud may be said to be present which throws its shadow upon
the earth; its nearness, that is to say, is recognised by the paralysis of
the Kingdom of Satan. In the fact that Jesus casts out the demons, the
Pharisees are bidden to recognise, according to Matt. xii. 25-28, that
the Kingdom of God is already come upon them.
<P>
This is the only sense in which Jesus thinks of the Kingdom as
present. He does not "establish it," He only proclaims its coming. He
exercises no "Messianic functions," but waits, like others, for God to
bring about the coming of the Kingdom by supernatural means. He
does not even know the day and hour when this shall come to pass. The
missionary journey of the disciples was not designed for the extension
of the Kingdom of God, but only as a means of rapidly and widely
making known its nearness. But it was not so near as Jesus thought.
The impenitence and hardness of heart of a great part of the people,
and the implacable enmity of His opponents, at length convinced Him
that the establishment of the Kingdom of God could not yet take place,
that such penitence as had been shown hitherto was not sufficient, and
"lat a mighty obstacle, the guilt of the people, must first be put away.
It becomes clear to Him that His own death must be the ransom-price.
He dies, not for the community of His followers only, but for the nation;
that is why He always speaks of His atoning death as "for many,"
<P>
<center>240</center>
<P>
not "for you." After His death He would come again in all the splendour
and glory with which, since the days of Daniel, men's imaginations had
surrounded the Messiah, and He was to come, moreover, within the lifetime of the generation to which He had proclaimed the nearness of the
Kingdom of God.
<P>
The setting up of the Kingdom was to be preceded by the Day of
Judgment. In describing the Messianic glory Jesus makes use of the traditional picture, but He does so with modesty, restraint, and sobriety.
Therein consists His greatness.
<P>
With political expectations this Kingdom has nothing whatever to do.
"To hope for the Kingdom of God in the transcendental sense which
Jesus attaches to it, and to raise a revolution, are two things as different
as fire and water." The transcendental character of the expectation consists precisely in this, that the State and all earthly institutions, conditions, and benefits, as belonging to the present age, shall either not
exist at all in the coming Kingdom, or shall exist only in a sublimated
form. Hence Jesus cannot preach to men a special ethic of the Kingdom
of God, but only an ethic which in this world makes men free from the
world and prepared to enter unimpeded into the Kingdom. That is why
His ethic is of so completely negative a character; it is, in fact, not so
much an ethic as a penitential discipline.
<P>
The ministry of Jesus is therefore not in principle different from that
of John the Baptist: there can be no question of a founding and development of the Kingdom within the hearts of men. What distinguishes
the work of Jesus from that of the Baptist is only His consciousness of
being the Messiah. He awoke to this consciousness at His baptism. But
the Messiahship which He claims is not a present office; its exercise belongs to the future. On earth He is only a man, a prophet, as in the
view implied in the speeches in the Acts of the Apostles. "Son of Man"
is therefore, in the passages where it is authentic, a purely eschatological
designation of the Messiah, though we cannot tell whether His hearers
understood Him as speaking of Himself in His future rank and dignity,
or whether they thought of the Son of Man as a being quite distinct from
Himself, whose coming He was only proclaiming in advance.
<P>
"The sole object of this argument is to prove that the Messianic self-consciousness of Jesus, as expressed in the title 'Son of Man,' shares
in the transcendental apocalyptic character of Jesus' idea of the Kingdom of God, and cannot be separated from that idea." The only partially
correct evaluation of the factors in the problem of the Life of Jesus
which Baldensperger had taken over from contemporary theology, and
which had hitherto prevented historical science from obtaining a solution of that problem, had now been corrected from the history itself, and
it was now only necessary to insert the corrected data into the calculation.
<P>
<center>241</center>
<P>
Here is the point at which it is fitting to recall Reimarus. He was
the first, and indeed, before Johannes Weiss, the only writer who recognised and pointed out that the preaching of Jesus was purely eschatological. It is true that his conception of the eschatology was primitive
and that he applied it not as a constructive, but as a destructive principle of criticism. But read his statement of the problem "with the signs
changed," and with the necessary deduction for the primitive character
of the eschatology, and you have the view of Weiss.
<P>
Ghillany, too, has a claim to be remembered. When Weiss asserts
that the part played by Jesus was not the active role of establishing the
Kingdom, but the passive role of waiting for the coming of the Kingdom;
and that it was, in a sense, only by the acceptance of His sufferings
that He emerged from that passivity; he is only asserting what Ghillany
had maintained thirty years before with the same arguments and with
the same decisiveness. But Weiss places the assertion on a scientifically
unassailable basis.
