schweig, 1778, 276 pp. (The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples A further Instal-
ment of the anonymous Woltenbiittel Fragments. Published by Gotthold
Ephraim Lessing. Brunswick, 1778.)
<P>
<i>Johann Salomo Semler</i>. Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten ins'
besondere vom Zwecke Jesu und seiner Jiinger. (Reply to the anonymous
Fragments, especially to that entitled "The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples.")
Halle, 1779, 432 pp.
<P>
BEFORE REIMARUS, NO ONE HAD ATTEMPTED TO FORM A HISTORICAL CONCEPTION of the life of Jesus. Luther had not so much as felt that he
cared to gain a clear idea of the order of the recorded events. Speaking
of the chronology of the cleansing of the Temple, which in John
falls at the beginning, in the Synoptists near the close, of Jesus' public
life, he remarks: "The Gospels follow no order in recording the acts
and miracles of Jesus, and the matter is not, after all, of much importance. If a difficulty arises in regard to the Holy Scripture and we
cannot solve it, we must just let it alone." When the Lutheran theologians
began to consider the question of harmonising the events, things were
still worse. Osiander (1498-1552), in his "Harmony of the Gospels,"
maintained the principle that if an event is recorded more than once in
the Gospels, in different connexions, it happened more than once and in
different connexions. The daughter of Jairus was therefore raised from
the dead several times; on one occasion Jesus allowed the devils whom
He cast out of a single demoniac to enter into a herd of swine, on another occasion, those whom He cast out of two demoniacs; there were
two cleansings of the Temple, and so forth.[1] The correct view of the
Synoptic Gospels as being interdependent was first formulated by Griesbach.
<P>
The only Life of Jesus written prior to the time of Reimarus which has
any interest for us, was composed by a Jesuit in the Persian language.
<P>
[1] Hase, <i>Geschichte Jesu</i>, 1876, pp. 112, 113.
<P>
<center>14</center>
<P>
The author was the Indian missionary Hieronymus Xavier, nephew of
Francis Xavier, and it was designed for the use of Akbar, the Moghul
Emperor, who, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, had become
the most powerful potentate in Hindustan. In the seventeenth century
the Persian text was brought to Europe by a merchant, and was translated into Latin by Louis de Dieu, a theologian of the Reformed Church,
whose intention in publishing it was to discredit Catholicism.[1] It is a
skilful falsification of the life of Jesus in which the omissions, and the
additions taken from the Apocrypha, are inspired by the sole purpose of
presenting to the open-minded ruler a glorious Jesus, in whom there
should be nothing to offend him.
<P>
Thus there had been nothing to prepare the world for a work of such
power as that of Reimarus. It is true, there had appeared earlier, in 1768,
a Life of Jesus by Johann Jakob Hess [2] (1741-1828), written from the
standpoint of the older rationalism, but it retains so much supernaturalism and follows so much the lines of a paraphrase of the Gospels, that
there was nothing to indicate to the world what a master-stroke the spirit
of the time was preparing.

Not much is known about Reimarus. For his contemporaries he had
no existence, and it was Strauss who first made his name known in literature. [3] He was born in Hamburg on the 22nd of December, 1694, and
spent his life there as a professor of Oriental Languages. He died in
1768. Several of his writings appeared during his lifetime, all of them
asserting the claims of rational religion as against the faith of the
Church; one of them, for example, being an essay on "The Leading
Truths of Natural Religion." His magnum opus, however, which laid the
historic basis of his attacks, was only circulated, during his lifetime,
among his acquaintances, as an anonymous manuscript. In 1774 Lessing
began to publish the most important portions of it, and up to 1778 had
published seven fragments, thereby involving himself in a quarrel with
Goetze, the Chief Pastor of Hamburg. The manuscript of the whole,
which runs to 4000 pages, is preserved in the Hamburg municipal
library.
<P>
The following are the titles of Fragments which he published:
<P>
<blockquote>
The Toleration of the Deists.<BR>
The Decrying of Reason in the Pulpit.<BR>

<blockquote>

The Passing of the Israelites through the Red Sea.<BR>
Showing that the books of the Old Testament were not written to
reveal a Religion.<BR>
Concerning the story of the Resurrection.<BR>
The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
The monograph on the passing of the Israelites through the Red Sea
is one of the ablest, wittiest, and most acute which has ever been written.
It exposes all the impossibilities of the narrative in the Priestly Codex,
and all the inconsistencies which arise from the combination of various
sources; although Reimarus has not the slightest inkling that the separation of these sources would afford the real solution of the problem.
<P>
To say that the fragment on "The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples"
is a magnificent piece of work is barely to do it justice. This essay is
not only one of the greatest events in the history of criticism, it is also
a masterpiece of general literature. The language is as a rule crisp and
terse, pointed and epigrammatic — the language of a man who is not
"engaged in literary composition" but is wholly concerned with the
facts. At times, however, it rises to heights of passionate feeling, and then
it is as though the fires of a volcano were painting lurid pictures upon
dark clouds. Seldom has there been a hate so eloquent, so lofty a scorn;
but then it is seldom that a work has been written in the just consciousness of so absolute a superiority to contemporary opinion. And withal,
there is dignity and serious purpose; Reimarus' work is no pamphlet.
<P>
Lessing could not, of course, accept its standpoint. His idea of revelation, and his conception of the Person of Jesus, were much deeper than
those of the Fragmentist. He was a thinker; Reimarus only a historian.
But this was the first time that a really historical mind, thoroughly conversant with the sources, had undertaken the criticism of the tradition.
It was Lessing's greatness that he grasped the significance of this criticism, and felt that it must lead either to the destruction or to the recasting of the idea of revelation. He recognised that the introduction
of the historical element would transform and deepen rationalism. Convinced that the fateful moment had arrived, he disregarded the scruples
of Reimarus' family and the objections of Nicolai and Mendelssohn,
and, though inwardly trembling for that which he himself held sacred, he
flung the torch with his own hand.
<P>
Semler, at the close of his refutation of the fragment, ridicules its
editor in the following apologue. "A prisoner was once brought before
<P>
<center>16</center>
<P>
the Lord Mayor of London on a charge of arson. He had been seen
coming down from the upper story of the burning house. 'Yesterday,'
so ran his defence, 'about four o'clock I went into my neighbour's storeroom and saw there a burning candle which the servants had carelessly
forgotten. In the course of the night it would have burned down, and set
fire to the stairs. To make sure that the fire should break out in the
day-time, I threw some straw upon it. The flames burst out at the skylight, the fire-engines came hurrying up, and the fire, which in the night
might have been dangerous, was promptly extinguished.' 'Why did you
not yourself pick up the candle and put it out?' asked the Lord Mayor.
'If I had put out the candle the servants would not have learned to be
more careful; now that there has been such a fuss about it, they will not
be so careless in future.' 'Odd, very odd,' said the Lord Mayor, 'he is not
a criminal, only a little weak in the head.' So he had him shut up in the
mad-house, and there he lies to this day."
<P>
The story is extraordinarily apposite — only that Lessing was not mad;
he knew quite well what he was doing. His object was to show how an
unseen enemy had pushed his parallels up to the very walls, and to summon to the defence "some one who should be as nearly the ideal defender
of religion as the Fragmentist was the ideal assailant." Once, with prophetic insight into the future, he says: "The Christian traditions must be
explained by the inner truth of Christianity, and no written traditions
can give it that inner truth, if it does not itself possess it."
<P>
Reimarus takes as his starting-point the question regarding the content of the preaching of Jesus. "We are justified," he says, "in drawing
an absolute distinction between the teaching of the Apostles in their
writings and what Jesus Himself in His own lifetime proclaimed and
taught." What belongs to the preaching of Jesus is clearly to be recognised. It is contained in two phrases of identical meaning, "Repent, and
believe the Gospel," or, as it is put elsewhere, "Repent, for the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand."
<P>
The Kingdom of Heaven must however be understood "according to Jewish ways of thought." Neither Jesus nor the Baptist ever explain this expression; therefore they must have been content to have it understood in its known and customary sense. That means that Jesus took His stand within the Jewish religion, and accepted its Messianic expectations without in any way correcting them. If He gives a new development to this
religion it is only in so far that He proclaims as near at hand the realisation of ideals and hopes which were alive in thousands of hearts.
<P>
There was thus no need for detailed instruction regarding the nature
of the Kingdom of Heaven; the catechism and confession of the Church
at its commencement consisted of a single phrase. Belief was not difficult:
"they need only believe the Gospel, namely that Jesus was about to bring
<P>
<center>17</center>
<P>
in the Kingdom of God." [1] As there were many among the Jews who were
already waiting for the Kingdom of God, it was no wonder that in a few
days, nay in a few hours, some thousands believed, although they had
been told only that Jesus was the promised prophet.
<P>
This was the sum total of what the disciples knew about the Kingdom
of God when they were sent out by their Master to proclaim its coming.
Their hearers would naturally think of the customary meaning of the
term and the hopes which attached themselves to it. "The purpose of
sending out such propagandists could only be that the Jews who groaned
under the Roman yoke and had long cherished the hope of deliverance
should be stirred up all over Judaea and assemble themselves in their
thousands."
<P>
Jesus must have known, too, that if the people believed His messengers
they would look about for an earthly deliverer and turn to Him for this
purpose. The Gospel, therefore, meant nothing more or less to all who
heard it than that, under the leadership of Jesus, the Kingdom of Messiah
was about to be brought in. For them there was no difficulty in accepting
the belief that He was the Messiah, the Son of God, for this belief did
not involve anything metaphysical. The nation was the Son of God; the
kings of the covenant-people were Sons of God; the Messiah was in a
pre-eminent sense the Son of God. Thus even in His Messianic claims
Jesus remained "within the limits of humanity."
<P>
The fact that He did not need to explain to His contemporaries what
He meant by the Kingdom of God constitutes a difficulty for us. The
parables do not enlighten us, for they presuppose a knowledge of the
conception. "If we could not gather from the writings of the Jews some
further information as to what was understood at that time by the
Messiah and the Kingdom of God, these points of primary importance
would be very obscure and incomprehensible."
<P>
If, therefore, we desire to gain a historical understanding of Jesus'
teaching, we must leave behind what we learned in our catechism regarding the metaphysical Divine Sonship, the Trinity, and similar dogmatic
conceptions, and go out into a wholly Jewish world of thought. Only
those who carry the teachings of the catechism back into the preaching
of the Jewish Messiah will arrive at the idea that He was the founder of
a new religion. To all unprejudiced persons it is manifest "that Jesus
had not the slightest intention of doing away with the Jewish religion
and putting another in its place."
<P>
From Matt. v. 18 it is evident that Jesus did not break with the Law,
but took His stand upon it unreservedly. If there was anything at all new
<P>
[1] The quotations inserted without special introduction are, of course, from
Reimarus. It is Dr. Schweitzer's method to lead up by a paragraph of exposition to
one of these characteristic phrases.—TRANSLATOR.
<P>
<center>18</center>
<P>
in His preaching, it was the righteousness which was requisite for the
Kingdom of God. The righteousness of the Law will no longer suffice in
the time of the coming Kingdom; a new and deeper morality must come
into being. This demand is the only point in which the preaching of Jesus
went beyond the ideas of His contemporaries. But this new morality does
not do away with the Law, for He explains it as a fulfilment of the old
commandments. His followers, no doubt, broke with the Law later on.
They did so, however, not in pursuance of a command of Jesus, but under
the pressure of circumstances, at the time when they were forced out of
Judaism and obliged to found a new religion.
<P>
Jesus shared the Jewish racial exclusiveness wholly and unreservedly.
According to Matt. x. 5 He forbade His disciples to declare to the Gentiles the coming of the Kingdom of God. Evidently, therefore. His purpose did not embrace them. Had it been otherwise, the hesitation of Peter
in Acts x. and xi., and the necessity of justifying the conversion of
Cornelius, would be incomprehensible.
<P>
Baptism and the Lord's Supper are no evidence that Jesus intended to
found a new religion. In the first place the genuineness of the command
to baptize in Matt. xxviii. 19 is questionable, not only as a saying
ascribed to the risen Jesus, but also because it is universalistic in outlook,
and because it implies the doctrine of the Trinity and, consequently,
the metaphysical Divine Sonship of Jesus. In this it is inconsistent with
the earliest traditions regarding the practice of baptism in the Christian
community, for in the earliest times, as we learn from the Acts and from
Paul, it was the custom to baptize, not in the name of the Trinity, but
in the name of Jesus, the Messiah.
<P>
But, furthermore, it is questionable whether Baptism really goes back
to Jesus at all. He Himself baptized no one in His own lifetime, and
never commanded any of His converts to be baptized. So we cannot be
sure about the origin of Baptism, though we can be sure of its meaning.
Baptism in the name of Jesus signified only that Jesus was the Messiah.
"For the only change which the teaching of Jesus made in their religion
was that whereas they had formerly believed in a Deliverer of Israel who
was to come in the future, they now believed in a Deliverer who was
already present."
<P>
The "Lord's Supper," again, was no new institution, but merely an
episode at the last Paschal Meal of the Kingdom which was passing
away, and was intended "as an anticipatory celebration of the Passover
of the New Kingdom." A Lord's Supper in our sense, "cut loose from
the Passover," would have been inconceivable to Jesus, and not less so
to His disciples.
<P>
It is useless to appeal to the miracles, any more than to the "Sacraments," as evidence for the founding of a new religion. In the first place,
<P>
<center>19</center>
<P>
we have to remember what happens in the case of miracles handed down
by tradition. That Jesus effected cures, which in the eyes of His contemporaries were miraculous, is not to be denied. Their purpose was to
prove Him to be the Messiah. He forbade these miracles to be made
known, even in cases where they could not possibly be kept hidden, "with
the sole purpose of making people more eager to talk of them." Other
miracles, however, have no basis in fact, but owe their place in the narrative to the feeling that the miracle-stories of the Old Testament must be
repeated in the case of Jesus, but on a grander scale. He did no really
miraculous works; otherwise, the demands for a sign would be incomprehensible. In Jerusalem when all the people were looking eagerly for
an overwhelming manifestation of His Messiahship, what a tremendous
effect a miracle would have produced! If only a single miracle had been
publicly, convincingly, undeniably, performed by Jesus before all the
people on one of the great days of the Feast, such is human nature that
all the people would at once have nocked to His standard.
<P>
For this popular uprising, however, He waited in vain. Twice He be-
lieved that it was near at hand. The first time was when He was sending
out the disciples and said to them: "Ye shall not have gone over the
cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes" (Matt. x. 23). He thought
that, at the preaching of the disciples, the people would flock to Him
from every quarter and immediately proclaim Him Messiah; but His
expectation was disappointed.
<P>
The second time, He thought to bring about the decisive issue in Jerusalem. He made His entry riding on an ass's colt, that the Messianic
prophecy of Zechariah might be fulfilled. And the people actually did
cry "Hosanna to the Son of David!" Relying on the support of His followers He might now, He thought, bid defiance to the authorities. In the
temple He arrogates to Himself supreme power, and in glowing words
calls for an open revolt against the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees, on the
ground that they have shut the doors of the Kingdom of Heaven and forbidden others to go in. There is no doubt, now, that He will carry the
people with Him! Confident in the success of His cause, He closes the
great incendiary harangue in Matt. xxiii. with the words "Truly from
henceforth ye shall not see me again until ye shall say Blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord"; that is, until they should hail Him as
Messiah.
<P>
But the people in Jerusalem refused to rise, as the Galilaeans had
refused at the time when the disciples were sent out to rouse them. The
Council prepared for vigorous action. The voluntary concealment by
which Jesus had thought to whet the eagerness of the people became
involuntary. Before His arrest He was overwhelmed with dread, and on
the cross He closed His life with the words "My God! my God! why
<P>
<center>20</center>
<P>
hast Thou forsaken me?" "This avowal cannot, without violence, be
interpreted otherwise than as meaning that God had not aided Him in
His aim and purpose as He had hoped. That shows that it had not been
His purpose to suffer and die, but to establish an earthly kingdom and
deliver the Jews from political oppression — and in that God's help had
failed Him."
<P>
For the disciples this turn of affairs meant the destruction of all the
dreams for the sake of which they had followed Jesus. For if they had
given up anything on His account, it was only in order to receive it
again an hundredfold when they should openly take their places in the
eyes of all the world as the friends and ministers of the Messiah, as the
rulers of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jesus never disabused them of this
sensuous hope, but, on the contrary, confirmed them in it. When He put
an end to the quarrel about pre-eminence, and when He answered the
request of the sons of Zebedee, He did not attack the assumption that
there were to be thrones and power, but only addressed Himself to the
question how men were in the present to establish their claims to that position of authority.
<P>
All this implies that the time of the fulfilment of these hopes was not
thought of by Jesus and His disciples as at all remote. In Matt. xvi. 28,
for example, He says: "Truly I say unto you there are some standing
here who shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in
his kingdom." There is no justification for twisting this about or explaining it away. It simply means that Jesus promises the fulfilment of
all Messianic hopes before the end of the existing generation.
<P>
Thus the disciples were prepared for anything rather than that which
actually happened. Jesus had never said a word to them about His dying
and rising again, otherwise they would not have so played the coward at
His death, nor have been so astonished at His "resurrection." The three
or four sayings referring to these events must therefore have been put
into His mouth later, in order to make it appear that He had foreseen
these events in His original plan.
<P>
How, then, did they get over this apparently annihilating blow? By
falling back upon the second form of the Jewish Messianic hope.
Hitherto their thoughts, like those of their Master, had been dominated
by the political ideal of the prophets — the scion of David's line who
should appear as the political deliverer of the nation. But alongside of
that there existed another Messianic expectation which transferred everything to the supernatural sphere. Appearing first in Daniel, this expectation can still be traced in the Apocalypses, in Justin's "Dialogue with
Trypho," and in certain Rabbinic sayings. According to these — Reimarus makes use especially of the statements of Trypho — the Messiah
is to appear twice; once in human lowliness, the second time upon the

clouds of heaven. When the first systema, as Reimarus calls it, was annihilated by the death of Jesus, the disciples brought forward the second,
and gathered followers who shared their expectation of a second coming
of Jesus the Messiah. In order to get rid of the difficulty of the death of
Jesus, they gave it the significance of a spiritual redemption — which had
not previously entered their field of vision or that of Jesus Himself.
<P>
But this spiritual interpretation of His death would not have helped
them if they had not also invented the resurrection. Immediately after
the death of Jesus, indeed, such an idea was far from their thoughts.
They were in deadly fear and kept close within doors. "Soon, however,
one and another ventures to slip out. They learn that no judicial search
is being made for them." Then they consider what is to be done. They
did not take kindly to the idea of returning to their old haunts; on their
journeyings the companions of the Messiah had forgotten how to work.
They had seen that the preaching of the Kingdom of God will keep a
man. Even when they had been sent out without wallet or money they
had not lacked. The women who are mentioned in Luke viii. 2, 3, had
made it their business to make good provision for the Messiah and His
future ministers.
<P>
Why not, then, continue this mode of life? They would surely find
a sufficient number of faithful souls who would join them in directing
their hopes towards a second coming of the Messiah, and while awaiting
the future glory, would share their possessions with them. So they stole
the body of Jesus and hid it, and proclaimed to all the world that He
would soon return. They prudently waited, however, for fifty days before
making this announcement, in order that the body, if it should be found,
might be unrecognisable.
<P>
What was much in their favour was the complete disorganisation of
the Jewish state. Had there been an efficient police administration the
disciples would not have been able to plan this fraud and organise their
communistic fellowship. But, as it was, the new society was not even
subjected to any annoyance in consequence of the remarkable death of
a married couple who were buried from the apostles' house, and the
brotherhood was even allowed to confiscate their property to its own
uses.
<P>
It appears, then, that the hope of the Parousia was the fundamental
thing in primitive Christianity, which was a product of that hope much
more than of the teaching of Jesus. Accordingly, the main problem of
primitive dogmatics was the delay of the Parousia. Already in Paul's time
the problem was pressing, and he had to set to work in 2 Thessalonians
to discover all possible and impossible reasons why the Second Coming
should be delayed. Reimarus mercilessly exposes the position of the
apostle, who was obliged to fob people off somehow or other. The
<P>
<center>22</center>
<P>
author of 2 Peter has a much clearer notion of what he would be at, and
undertakes to restore the confidence of Christendom once for all with
the sophism of the thousand years which are in the sight of God as one
day, ignoring the fact that in the promise the reckoning was by man's
years, not by God's. "Nevertheless it served the turn of the Apostles so
well with those simple early Christians, that after the first believers had
been bemused with it, and the period originally fixed had elapsed, the
Christians of later generations, including Fathers of the Church, could
continue ever after to feed themselves with empty hopes." The saying
of Christ about the generation which should not die out before His
return clearly fixes this event at no very distant date. But since Jesus has
not yet appeared upon the clouds of heaven "these words must be
strained into meaning, not that generation, but the Jewish people. Thus
by exegetical art they are saved for ever, for the Jewish race will never
die out."
<P>
In general, however, "the theologians of the present day skim lightly
over the eschatological material in the Gospels because it does not chime
in with their views, and assign to the coming of Christ upon the clouds
quite a different purpose from that which it bears in the teaching of
Christ and His apostles." Inasmuch as the non-fulfilment of its eschatology is not admitted, our Christianity rests upon a fraud. In view of this
fact, what is the evidential value of any miracle, even if it could be held
to be authentic? "No miracle would prove that two and two make five,
or that a circle has four angles; and no miracles, however numerous,
could remove a contradiction which lies on the surface of the teachings
and records of Christianity." Nor is there any weight in the appeal to the
fulfilment of prophecy, for the cases in which Matthew countersigns it
with the words "that the Scripture might be fulfilled" are all artificial
and unreal; and for many incidents the stage was set by Jesus, or His
disciples, or the Evangelists, with the deliberate purpose of presenting
to the people a scene from the fulfilment of prophecy.
<P>
The sole argument which could save the credit of Christianity would
be a proof that the Parousia had really taken place at the time for which
it was announced; and obviously no such proof can be produced.
<P>
Such is Reimarus' reconstruction of the history. We can well understand that his work must have given offence when it appeared, for it is
a polemic, not an objective historical study. But we have no right simply
to dismiss it in a word, as a Deistic production, as Otto Schmiedel, for
example, does; [1] it is time that Reimarus came to his own, and that we
should recognise a historical performance of no mean order in this
piece of Deistic polemics. His work is perhaps the most splendid achieve-
<P>

<P>
<center>23</center>
<P>
ment in the whole course of the historical investigation of the life of
Jesus, for he was the first to grasp the fact that the world of thought in
which Jesus moved was essentially eschatological. There is some justification for the animosity which flames up in his writing. This historical
truth had taken possession of his mind with such overwhelming force
that he could no longer understand his contemporaries, and could not
away with their profession that their beliefs were, as they professed to
be, directly derived from the preaching of Jesus.
<P>
What added to the offence was that he saw the eschatology in a wrong
perspective. He held that the Messianic ideal which dominated the
preaching of Jesus was that of the political ruler, the son of David. All
his other mistakes are the consequence of this fundamental error. It
was, of course, a mere makeshift hypothesis to derive the beginnings
of Christianity from an imposture. Historical science was not at that
time sufficiently advanced to lead even the man who had divined the
fundamentally eschatological character of the preaching of Jesus onward
to the historical solution of the problem; it needed more than a hundred
and twenty years to fill in the chasm which Reimarus had been forced to
bridge with that makeshift hypothesis of his.
<P>
In the light of the clear perception of the elements of the problem
which Reimarus had attained, the whole movement of theology, down
to Johannes Weiss, appears retrograde. In all its work the thesis is ignored or obscured that Jesus, as a historical personality, is to be regarded, not as the founder of a new religion, but as the final product
of the eschatological and apocalyptic thought of Late Judaism. Every
sentence of Johannes Weiss's <i>Die Predigt Jesu vom Reiche Gottes</i> (1892)
is a vindication, a rehabilitation, of Reimarus as a historical thinker.
<P>
Even so the traveller on the plain sees from afar the distant range of
mountains. Then he loses sight of them again. His way winds slowly
upwards through the valleys, drawing ever nearer to the peaks, until at
last, at a turn of the path, they stand before him, not in the shapes which
they had seemed to take from the distant plain, but in their actual forms.
Reimarus was the first, after eighteen centuries of misconception, to
have an inkling of what eschatology really was. Then theology lost sight
of it again, and it was not until after the lapse of more than a hundred
years that it came in view of eschatology once more, now in its true
form, so far as that can be historically determined, and only after it
had been led astray, almost to the last, in all its historical researches by
the sole mistake of Reimarus — the assumption that the eschatology was
earthly and political in character. Thus theology shared at least the error
of the man whom it knew only as a Deist, not as an historian, and whose
true greatness was not recognised even by Strauss, though he raised a
literary monument to him.
<P>
<center>24</center>
<P>
The solution offered by Reimarus may be wrong; the data of observation from which he starts out are, beyond question, right, because the
primary datum of all is genuinely historical. He recognised that two
systems of Messianic expectation were present side by side in Late Judaism. He endeavoured to bring them into mutual relations in order to
represent the actual movement of the history. In so doing he made the
mistake of placing them in consecutive order, ascribing to Jesus the
political Son-of-David conception, and to the Apostles, after His death,
the apocalyptic system based on Daniel, instead of superimposing one
upon the other in such a way that the Messianic King might coincide
with the Son of Man, and the ancient prophetic conception might be
inscribed within the circumference of the Daniel-descended apocalyptic,
and raised along with it to the supersensuous plane. But what matters
the mistake in comparison with the fact that the problem was really
grasped?
<P>
Reimarus felt that the absence in the preaching of Jesus of any definition of the principal term (the Kingdom of God), in conjunction with
the great and rapid success of His preaching constituted a problem, and
he formulated the conception that Jesus was not a religious founder and
teacher, but purely a preacher.
<P>
He brought the Synoptic and Johannine narratives into harmony by
practically leaving the latter out of account. The attitude of Jesus towards the law, and the process by which the disciples came to take up
a freer attitude, was grasped and explained by him so accurately that
modern historical science does not need to add a word, but would be well
pleased if at least half the theologians of the present day had got as far.
<P>
Further, he recognised that primitive Christianity was not something
which grew, so to speak, out of the teaching of Jesus, but that it came
into being as a new creation, in consequence of events and circumstances
which added something to that preaching which it did not previously
contain; and that Baptism and the Lord's Supper, in the historical sense
of these terms, were not instituted by Jesus, but created by the early
Church on the basis of certain historical assumptions.
<P>
Again, Reimarus felt that the fact that the "event of Easter" was first
proclaimed at Pentecost constituted a problem, and he sought a solution
for it. He recognised, further, that the solution of the problem of the life
of Jesus calls for a combination of the methods of historical and literary
criticism. He felt that merely to emphasise the part played by eschatology would not suffice, but that it was necessary to assume a creative element in the tradition, to which he ascribed the miracles, the stories which
turn on the fulfilment of Messianic prophecy, the universalistic traits
and the predictions of the passion and the resurrection. Like Wrede, too
he feels that the prescription of silence in the case of miracles of healing
<P>
<center>25</center>
<P>
and of certain communications to the disciples constitutes a problem
which demands solution.
<P>
Still more remarkable is his eye for exegetical detail. He has an unfailing instinct for pregnant passages like Matt. x. 23, xvi. 28, which are
crucial for the interpretation of large masses of the history. The fact
is there are some who are historians by the grace of God, who from their
mother's womb have an instinctive feeling for the real. They follow
through all the intricacy and confusion of reported fact the pathway of
reality, like a stream which, despite the rocks that encumber its course
and the windings of its valley, finds its way inevitably to the sea. No
erudition can supply the place of this historical instinct, but erudition
sometimes serves a useful purpose, inasmuch as it produces in its possessors the pleasing belief that they are historians, and thus secures
their services for the cause of history. In truth they are at best merely
doing the preliminary spade-work of history, collecting for a future
historian the dry bones of fact, from which, with the aid of his natural
gift, he can recall the past to life. More often, however, the way in which
erudition seeks to serve history is by suppressing historical discoveries
as long as possible, and leading out into the field to oppose the one
true view an army of possibilities. By arraying these in support of one
another it finally imagines that it has created out of possibilities a living
reality.
<P>
This obstructive erudition is the special prerogative of theology, in
which, even at the present day, a truly marvellous scholarship often
serves only to blind the eyes to elementary truths, and to cause the artificial to be preferred to the natural. And this happens not only with
those who deliberately shut their minds against new impressions, but
also with those whose purpose is to go forward, and to whom their contemporaries look up as leaders. It was a typical illustration of this fact
when Semler rose up and slew Reimarus in the name of scientific
theology.[1]
<P>
Reimarus had discredited progressive theology. Students — so Semler
tells us in his preface — became unsettled and sought other callings. The
great Halle theologian — born in 1725 — the pioneer of the historical view
of the Canon, the precursor of Baur in the reconstruction of primitive
Christianity, was urged to do away with the offence. As Origen of yore
with Celsus, so Semler takes Reimarus sentence by sentence, in such a
way that if his work were lost it could be recovered from the refutation.
The fact was that Semler had nothing in the nature of a complete or
well-articulated argument to oppose to him; therefore he inaugurated
<P>
[1] Doderlein also wrote a defence of Jesus against the Fragmentist: <i>Fragments
und Antifragmente</i>. Nuremberg, 1778.
<P>
<center>26</center>
<P>
in his reply the "Yes, but" theology, which thereafter, for more than
three generations, while it took, itself, the most various modifications,
imagined that it had finally got rid of Reimarus and his discovery.
<P>
Reimarus — so ran the watchword of the guerrilla warfare which
Semler waged against him — cannot be right, for he is one-sided. Jesus
and His disciples employed two methods of teaching: one sensuous, pictorial, drawn from the sphere of Jewish ideas, by which they adapted
their meaning to the understanding of the multitude, and endeavoured to
raise them to a higher way of thinking; and alongside of that a purely
spiritual teaching which was independent of that kind of imagery. Both
methods of teaching continued to be used side by side, because there
were always contemporary representatives of the two degrees of capability and the two kinds of temperament. "This is historically so certain
that the Fragmentist's attack must inevitably be defeated at this point,
because he takes account only of the sensuous representation." But his
attack was not defeated. What happened was that, owing to the respect
in which Semler was held, and the absolute incapacity of contemporary
theology to overtake the long stride forward made by Reimarus, his work
was neglected, and the stimulus which it was capable of imparting failed
to take effect. He had no predecessors; neither had he any disciples. His
work is one of those supremely great works which pass and leave no
trace, because they are before their time; to which later generations pay
a just tribute of admiration, but owe no gratitude. Indeed it would be
truer to say that Reimarus hung a mill-stone about the neck of the rising
theological science of his time. He avenged himself on Semler by shaking
his faith in historical theology and even in the freedom of science in
general. By the end of the eighth decade of the century the Halle professor was beginning to retrace his steps, was becoming more and more
disloyal to the cause which he had formerly served; and he finally went
so far as to give his approval to Wollner's edict for the regulation of
religion (1788), His friends attributed this change of front to senility —
he died 1791.
<P>
Thus the magnificent overture in which are announced all the motifs
of the future historical treatment of the life of Jesus breaks off with a
sudden discord, remains isolated and incomplete, and leads to nothing
further.
