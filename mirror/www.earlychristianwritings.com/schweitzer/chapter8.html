<center><h2>STRAUSS'S FIRST "LIFE OF JESUS"</h2></center>
<P>

</blockquote>
<P>
CONSIDERED AS A LITERARY WORK, STRAUSS'S FIRST LIFE OF JESUS IS ONE
of the most perfect things in the whole range of learned literature. In
over fourteen hundred pages he has not a superfluous phrase; his analysis descends to the minutest details, but he does not lose his way among
them; the style is simple and picturesque, sometimes ironical, but always
dignified and distinguished.
<P>
In regard to the application of the mythological explanation to Holy
Scripture, Strauss points out that De Wette, Eichhorn, Gabler, and
others of his predecessors had long ago freely applied it to the Old
Testament, and that various attempts had been made to portray the life
of Jesus in accordance with the critical assumptions upon which his
undertaking was based. He mentions especially Usteri as one who had
helped to prepare the way for him. The distinction between Strauss and
those who had preceded him upon this path consists only in this, that
prior to him the conception of myth was neither truly grasped nor consistently applied. Its application was confined to the account of Jesus
coming into the world and of His departure from it, while the real kernel
of the evangelical tradition—the sections from the Baptism to the Resurrection—was left outside the field of its application. Myth formed, to
use Strauss's illustration, the lofty gateways at the entrance to, and at the
exit from, the Gospel history; between these two lofty gateways lay the
narrow and crooked streets of the naturalistic explanation.
<P>
The principal obstacle, Strauss continues, which barred the way to a
comprehensive application of myth, consisted in the supposition that two
of our Gospels, Matthew and John, were reports of eyewitnesses; and a
further difficulty was the offence caused by the word myth, owing to its
associations with the heathen mythology. But that any of our Evangelists
was an eyewitness, or stood in such relations with eyewitnesses as to
<P>
<center>79</center>
<P>
make the intrusion of myth unthinkable, is a thesis which there is no
extant evidence sufficient to prove. Even though the earthly life of the
Lord falls within historic times, and even if only a generation be assumed to have elapsed between His death and the composition of the
Gospels; such a period would be sufficient to allow the historical material
to become intermixed with myth. No sooner is a great man dead than
legend is busy with his life.
<P>
Then, too, the offence of the word myth disappears for any one who
has gained an insight into the essential character of religious myth. It is
nothing else than the clothing in historic form of religious ideas, shaped
by the unconsciously inventive power of legend, and embodied in a historic personality. Even on a priori grounds we are almost compelled to
assume that the historic Jesus will meet us in the garb of old Testament
Messianic ideas and primitive Christian expectations.
<P>
The main distinction between Strauss and his predecessors consisted
in the fact that they asked themselves anxiously how much of the historical life of Jesus would remain as a foundation for religion if they
dared to apply the conception of myth consistently, while for him this
question had no terrors. He claims in his preface that he possessed one
advantage over all the critical and learned theologians of his time without which nothing can be accomplished in the domain of history—the
inner emancipation of thought and feeling in regard to certain religious
and dogmatic prepossessions which he had early attained as a result of
his philosophic studies. Hegel's philosophy had set him free, giving him
a clear conception of the relationship of idea and reality, leading him to
a higher plane of Christological speculation, and opening his eyes to
the mystic interpenetration of finitude and infinity, God and man.
<P>
God-manhood, the highest idea conceived by human thought, is actually realised in the historic personality of Jesus. But while conventional
thinking supposes that this phenomenal realisation must be perfect, true
thought, which has attained by genuine critical reasoning to a higher
freedom, knows that no idea can realise itself perfectly on the historic
plane, and that its truth does not depend on the proof of its having
received perfect external representation, but that its perfection comes
about through that which the idea carries into history, or through the
way in which history is sublimated into idea. For this reason it is in the
last analysis indifferent to what extent God-manhood has been realised
in the person of Jesus; the important thing is that the idea is now alive
in the common consciousness of those who have been prepared to receive
it by its manifestation in sensible form, and of whose thought and imagination that historical personality took such complete possession, that for
them the unity of Godhood and manhood assumed in Him enters into
the common consciousness, and the "moments" which constitute the out-
<P>
<center>80</center>
<P>
ward course of His life reproduce themselves in them in a spiritual
fashion.
<P>
A purely historical presentation of the life of Jesus was in that first
period wholly impossible; what was operative was a creative reminiscence acting under the impulse of the idea which the personality of
Jesus had called to life among mankind. And this idea of God-manhood,
the realisation of which in every personality is the ultimate goal of
humanity, is the eternal reality in the Person of Jesus, which no criticism
can destroy.
<P>
However far criticism may go in providing the reaction of the idea
upon the presentment of the historical course of the life of Jesus, the
fact that Jesus represented that idea and called it to life among mankind
is something real, something that no criticism can annul. It is alive
thenceforward—to this day, and forever more.
<P>
It is in this emancipation of spirit, and in the consciousness that
Jesus as the creator of the religion of humanity is beyond the reach of
criticism, that Strauss goes to work, and batters down the rubble, assured
that his pick can make no impression on the stone. He sees evidence that
the time has come for this undertaking in the condition of exhaustion
which characterised contemporary theology. The supernaturalistic explanation of the events of the life of Jesus liad been followed by the
rationalistic, the one making everything supernatural, the other setting
itself to make all the events intelligible as natural occurrences. Each
had said all that it had to say. From their opposition now arises a new
solution—the mythological interpretation. This is a characteristic example of the Hegelian method—the synthesis of a thesis represented by
the supernaturalistic explanation with an antithesis represented by the
rationalistic interpretation.
<P>
Strauss's Life of Jesus is, therefore, like Schleiermacher's, the product
of antithetic conceptions. But whereas in the latter the antitheses
Docetism and Ebionism are simply limiting conceptions, between which
his view is statically suspended, the synthesis with which Strauss operates
represents a composition of forces, of which his view is the dynamic
resultant. The dialectic is in the one case descriptive, in the other creative. This Hegelian dialectic determines the method of the work. Each
incident of the life of Jesus is considered separately; first as supernaturally explained, and then as rationalistically explained, and the one
explanation is refuted by the other. "By this means," says Strauss in his
preface, "the incidental advantage is secured that the work is fitted to
serve as a repertory of the leading views and discussions of all parts of
the Gospel history."
<P>
In every case the whole range of representative opinions is reviewed.
Finally the forced interpretations necessitated by the naturalistic ex-
<P>
<center>81</center>
<P>
planation of the narrative under discussion drives the reader back upon
the supernaturalistic. That had been recognized by Hase and Schleiermacher, and they had felt themselves obliged to make a place for inexplicable supernatural elements alongside of the historic elements of the
life of Jesus. Contemporaneously there had sprung up in all directions
new attempts to return by the aid of a mystical philosophy to the supernaturalistic point of view of our forefathers. But in these Strauss recognises only the last desperate efforts to make the past present and to conceive the inconceivable; and in direct opposition to the reactionary ineptitudes by means of which critical theology was endeavouring to work
its way out of rationalism, he sets up the hypothesis that these inexplicable elements are mythical.
<P>
In the stories prior to the baptism, everything is myth. The narratives
are woven on the pattern of Old Testament prototypes, with modifications due to Messianic or messianically interpreted passages. Since
Jesus and the Baptist came into contact with one another later, it is
felt necessary to represent their parents as having been connected. The
attempts to construct Davidic genealogies for Jesus, show us that there
was a period in the formation of the Gospel History during which the
Lord was simply regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, otherwise
genealogical studies of this kind would not have been undertaken. Even
in the story of the twelve-year-old Jesus in the temple, there is scarcely
more than a trace of historical material.
<P>
In the narrative of the baptism we may take it as certainly unhistorical that the Baptist received a revelation of the Messianic dignity
of Jesus, otherwise he could not later have come to doubt this. Whether his message to Jesus is historical must be left an open question; its possibility depends on whether the nature of his confinement admitted of
such communication with the outer world. Might not a natural reluctance to allow the Baptist to depart this life without at least a dawning
recognition of the Messiahship of Jesus have here led to the insertion
of a legendary trait into the tradition? If so, the historical residuum
would be that Jesus was for a time one of the adherents of the Baptist,
and was baptized by him, and that He soon afterwards appeared in
Galilee with the same message which John had proclaimed, and even
when He had outgrown his influence, never ceased to hold John in high
esteem, as is shown by the eulogy which He pronounced upon him. But
if the baptism of John was a baptism of repentance with a view to "him
who was to come," Jesus cannot have held Himself to be sinless when
He submitted to it. Otherwise we should have to suppose that He did it
merely for appearance' sake. Whether it was in the moment of the baptism that the consciousness of His Messiahship dawned upon Him, we
cannot tell. This only is certain, that the conception of Jesus as having
<P>
<center>82</center>
<P>
been endowed with the Spirit at His baptism, was independent of, and
earlier than, that other conception which held Him to have been supernaturally born of the Spirit. We have, therefore, in the Synoptists several
different strata of legend and narrative, which in some cases intersect
and in some are superimposed one upon the other.
<P>
The story of the temptation is equally unsatisfactory, whether it be
interpreted as supernatural, or as symbolical either of an inward struggle
or of external events (as for example in Venturini's interpretation of
it, where the part of the Tempter is played by a Pharisee) ; it is simply
primitive Christian legend, woven together out of Old Testament suggestions.
<P>
The call of the first disciples cannot have happened as it is narrated,
without their having known anything of Jesus beforehand; the manner
of the call is modelled upon the call of Elisha by Elijah. The further
legend attached to it—Peter's miraculous draught of fishes—has arisen
out of the saying about "fishers of men," and the same idea is reflected,
at a different angle of refraction, in John xxi. The mission of the seventy
is unhistorical.
<P>
Whether the cleansing of the temple is historical, or whether it arose
out of a Messianic application of the text, "My house shall be called a
house of prayer," cannot be determined. The difficulty of forming a clear
idea of the circumstances is not easily to be removed. How freely the
historical material has been worked up, is seen in the groups of stories
which have grown out of a single incident; as, for example, the anointing
of Jesus at Bethany by an unknown woman, out of which Luke has made
an anointing by a penitent sinner, and John an anointing by Mary of
Bethany.
<P>
As regards the healings, some of them are certainly historical, but not
in the form in which tradition has preserved them. The recognition of
Jesus as Messiah by the demons immediately arouses suspicion. It is
doubtless rather to be ascribed to the tendency which grew up later to
represent Him as receiving, in His Messianic character, homage even
from the world of evil spirits, than to any advantage in respect of
clearness of insight which distinguished the mentally deranged, in comparison with their contemporaries. The cure of the demoniac in the
synagogue at Capernaum may well be historical, but, in other cases, the
procedure is so often raised into the region of the miraculous that a
psychical influence of Jesus upon the sufferer no longer suffices to explain
it; the creative activity of legend must have come in to confuse the
account of what really happened.
<P>
One cure has sometimes given rise to three or four narratives. Sometimes we can still recognise the influences which have contributed to
mould a story. When, for example, the disciples are unable to heal the
<P>
<center>83</center>
<P>
lunatic boy during Jesus' absence on the Mount of Transfiguration, we
are reminded of 2 Kings iv., where Elisha's servant Gehazi tries in vain
to bring the dead boy to life by using the staff of the prophet. The immediate healing of leprosy has its prototype in the story of Naaman the
Syrian. The story of the ten lepers shows so clearly a didactic tendency
that its historic value is thereby rendered doubtful.
<P>
The cures of blindness all go back to the case of the blind man at
Jericho. But who can say how far this is itself historical? The cures of
paralytics, too, belong rather to the equipment of the Messiah than to
history. The cures through touching clothes, and the healings at a distance, have myth written on their foreheads. The fact is, the Messiah
must equal, nay, surpass, the deeds of the prophets. That is why raising
from the dead figure among His miracles.
<P>
The nature miracles, over a collection of which Strauss puts the heading "Sea-Stories and Fish-Stories," have a much larger admixture of the
mythical. His opponents took him severely to task for this irreverent
superscription.
<P>
The repetition of the story of the feeding of the multitude arouses
suspicion regarding the credibility of what is narrated, and at once invalidates the hypothesis of the apostolic authorship of the Gospel of
Matthew. Moreover, the incident was so naturally suggested by Old
Testament examples that it would have been a miracle if such a story
had not found its way into the Life of Jesus. An explanation on the
analogy of an expedited process of nature, is here, as in the case of the
miracle at Cana also, to be absolutely rejected. Strauss allows it to be
laughed out of court. The cursing of the fig-tree and its fulfilment go
back in some way or other to a parable of Jesus, which was afterwards
made into history.
<P>
More important than the miracles heretofore mentioned are those
which have to do with Jesus Himself and mark the crises of His history.
The transfiguration had to find a place in the life of Jesus, because of the
shining of Moses' countenance. In dealing with the narratives of the
resurrection it is evident that we must distinguish two different strata of
legend, an older one, represented by Matthew, which knew only of appearances in Galilee, and a later, in which the Galilaean appearances are
excluded in favour of appearances in Jerusalem. In both cases, however,
the narratives are mythical. In any attempt to explain them we are
forced on one horn of the dilemma or the other—if the resurrection
was real, the death was not real, and vice versa. That the ascension is
a myth is self-evident.
<P>
Such, and so radical, are the results at which Strauss's criticism of
the supernaturalistic and the rationalistic explanations of the life of
Jesus ultimately arrives.
<P>
<center>84</center>
<P>
In reading Strauss's discussions one is not so much struck with their
radical character, because of the admirable dialectic skill with which he
shows the total impossibility of any explanation which does not take
account of myth. On the whole, the supernaturalistic explanation, which
at least represents the plain sense of the narratives, comes off much better
than the rationalistic, the artificiality of which is everywhere remorselessly exposed.
<P>
The sections which we have summarized are far from having lost
their significance at the present day. They marked out the ground which
is now occupied by modern critical study. And they filled in the death-certificates of a whole series of explanations which, at first sight, have all
the air of being alive, but are not really so. If these continue to haunt
present-day theology, it is only as ghosts, which can be put to flight by
simply pronouncing the name of David Friedrich Strauss, and which
would long ago have ceased to "walk," if the theologians who regard
Strauss's book as obsolete would only take the trouble to read it.
<P>
The results so far considered do not represent the elements of the life
of Jesus which Strauss was prepared to accept as historical. He sought
to make the boundaries of the mythical embrace the widest possible area;
and it is clear that he extended them too far.
<P>
For one thing, he overestimates the importance of the Old Testament
motives in reference to the creative activity of the legend. He does not
see that while in many cases he has shown clearly enough the source of
the form of the narrative in question, this does not suffice to explain its
origin. Doubtless, there is mythical material in the story of the feeding
of the multitude. But the existence of the story is not explained by referring to the manna in the desert, or the miraculous feeding of a multitude
by Elisha. [1] The story in the Gospel has far too much individuality for
that, and stands, moreover, in much too closely articulated an historical
connexion. It must have as its basis some historical fact. It is not a
myth, though there is myth in it. Similarly with the account of the
transfiguration. The substratum of historical fact in the life of Jesus is
much more extensive than Strauss is prepared to admit. Sometimes he
fails to see the foundations, because he proceeds like an explorer who,
in working on the ruins of an Assyrian city, should cover up the most
valuable evidence with the rubbish thrown out from another portion
of the excavations.
<P>
Again, he sometimes rules out statements by assuming their impossibility on purely dialectical grounds, or by playing off the narratives one
against another. The Baptist's message to Jesus is a case in point. This
is connected with the fact that he often fails to realise the strong con-
<P>
[1] 2 Kings iv, 42-44.
<P>
<center>85</center>
<P>
armation which the narratives derive from their connexion with the
preceding and following context.
<P>
That, however, was only to be expected. Who ever discovered a true
principle without pressing its application too far?
<P>
What really alarmed his contemporaries was not so much the comprehensive application of the mythical theory, as the general mining and
sapping operations which they were obliged to see brought to bear upon
the Gospels.
<P>
In section after section Strauss cross-examines the reports on every
point, down to the minutest detail, and then pronounces in what proportion an alloy of myth enters into each of them. In every case the
decision is unfavourable to the Gospel of John. Strauss was the first to
take this view. It is true that, at the end of the eighteenth century, many
doubts as to the authenticity of this Gospel had been expressed, and
Bretschneider, the famous General Superintendent at Gotha (1776-1848), had made a tentative collection of them in his Probabilia. [1] The
essay made some stir at the time. But Schleiermacher threw the aegis of
his authority over the authenticity of the Gospel, and it was the favourite
Gospel of the rationalists because it contained fewer miracles than the
others. Bretschneider himself declared that he had been brought to a
better opinion through the controversy.
<P>
After this episode the Johannine question had been shelved for fifteen
years. The excitement was, therefore, all the greater when Strauss re-opened the discussion. He was opposing a dogma of critical theology,
which, even at the present day, is wont to defend its dogmas with a
tenacity beyond that of the Church itself.
<P>
The luminous haze of apparent circumstantiality which had hitherto
prevented men from recognising the true character of this Gospel is completely dissipated. Strauss shows that the Johannine representation of
the life of Jesus is dominated by a theory, and that its portraiture shows
the further development of the tendencies which are perceptible even in
the Synoptists. He shows this, for example, in the case of the Johannine
narrative of the baptism of Jesus, in which critics had hitherto seen the
most credible account of what occurred, pointing out that it is just in this
pseudo-simplicity that the process of bringing Jesus and the Baptist
into the closest possible relations reaches its limit. Similarly, in regard
to the call of the first disciples, it is, according to Strauss, a later postulate that they came from the Baptist's following and were brought by
him to the Lord. Strauss does not scruple even to assert that John introduces imaginary characters. If this Gospel relates fewer miracles, the
miracles which it retains are proportionately greater; so great, indeed,
<P>
[1] <i>Probabilia de evangelii et epistolarum loannis Apostoli indole et origine
cruditorum iudiciis modeste subjecit C. Th. Bretschneider</i>. Leipzig, 1820.
<P>
<center>86</center>
<P>
that their absolutely miraculous character is beyond the shadow of
doubt; and, moreover, a moral or symbolical significance is added.
<P>
Here, therefore, it is no longer the unconscious action of legend which
selects, creates, or groups the incidents, but a clearly-determined apologetic and dogmatic purpose.
<P>
The question regarding the different representations of the locality
and chronology of the life of Jesus, had always been decided, prior to
Strauss, in favour of the Fourth Gospel. De Wette makes it an argument
against the genuineness of Matthew's Gospel that it mistakenly confines
the ministry of Jesus to Galilee. Strauss refuses to decide the question
by simply weighing the chronological and geographical statements one
against the other, lest he should be as one-sided in his own way as the
defenders of the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel were in theirs. On
this point, he contents himself with remarking that if Jesus had really
taught in Jerusalem on several occasions, it is absolutely unintelligible
how all knowledge of this could have so completely disappeared from
the Synoptic tradition; for His going up to the Passover at which He
met His death is there represented as His sole journey to Jerusalem. On
the other hand, it is quite conceivable that if Jesus had only once been
in Jerusalem there would be a tendency for legend gradually to make
several journeys out of this one, on the natural assumption that He regularly went up to the Feasts, and that He would proclaim His Gospel not
merely in the remote province, but also in the capital.
<P>
From the triumphal entry to the resurrection, the difference between
the Synoptic and Johannine narratives is so great that all attempts to
harmonise them are to be rejected. How are we to reconcile the statement
of the Synoptists that the ovation at the triumphal entry was offered by
Galilaeans who accompanied him, with that of John, according to which
it was offered by a multitude from Jerusalem which came out to welcome
Jesus—who, moreover, according to John, was not coming from Galilee
and Jericho—and escorted Him into the city. To suppose that there were
two different triumphal entries is absurd.
<P>
But the decision between John and the Synoptists is not based solely
upon their representation of the facts; the decisive consideration is
found in the ideas by which they are respectively dominated. John represents a more advanced stage of the mythopoeic process, inasmuch as he
has substituted for the Jewish Messianic conception, the Greek metaphysical conception of the Divine Sonship, and, on the basis of his
acquaintance with the Alexandrian Logos doctrine, even makes Jesus
apply to Himself the Greek speculative conception of pre-existence. The
writer is aware of an already existing danger from the side of a Gnostic
docetism, and has himself an apologetic Christology to propound, thus
fighting the Gnostics as a Gnostic of another kind. That he is free from
<P>
<center>87</center>
<P>
eschatological conceptions is not, from the historical point of view, an
advantage, but very much the reverse. He is not unacquainted with
eschatology, but deliberately transforms it, endeavouring to substitute
for the expectation of the Second Coming of Christ, as an external event
of the future, the thought of His inward presence.
<P>
The most decisive evidence of all is found in the farewell discourses-and in the absence of all mention of the spiritual struggle in Gethsemane.
The intention here is to show that Jesus not only had a foreknowledge of
His death, but had long overcome it in anticipation, and went to meet
His tragic fate with perfect inward serenity. That, however, is no historical narrative, but the final stage of reverent idealisation.
<P>
The question is decided. The Gospel of John is inferior to the Synoptics as a historical source just in proportion as it is more strongly
dominated than they by theological and apologetic interests. It is true
that the assignment of the dominant motives for Strauss's criticism
mainly a matter of conjecture. He cannot define in detail the attitude
and tendency of this Gospel, because the development of dogma in the
second century was still to a great extent obscure. He himself admits-
that it was only subsequently, through the labours of Baur, that the posi-
tions which he had taken up in 1835 were rendered impregnable. And
yet it is true to say that Johannine study has added in principle nothing
new to what was said by Strauss. He recognised the decisive point. With
critical acumen he resigned the attempt to base a decision on a comparison of the historical data, and allowed the theological character of
the two lines of tradition to determine the question. Unless this is done
the debate is endless, for an able man who has sworn allegiance to John
will always find a thousand ways in which the Johannine data can be
reconciled with those of the Synoptists, and is finally prepared to stake
his life upon the exact point at which the missing account of the institution of the Lord's Supper must be inserted into the narrative.
<P>
This changed estimate of John carries with it a reversal of the order
in which the Gospels are supposed to have originated. Instead of John,
Luke, Matthew, we have Matthew, Luke, and John—the first is last, and
the last first. Strauss's unsophisticated instinct freed Matthew from the
humiliating vassalage to which Schleiermacher's aesthetic had consigned
him. The practice of differentiating between John and the Synoptists,
which in the hands of Schleiermacher and Hase had been an elegant
amusement, now received unexpected support, and it at last became possible for the study of the life of Jesus to go forward.
<P>
But no sooner had Strauss opened up the way than he closed it again,
by refusing to admit the priority of Mark. His attitude towards this
Gospel at once provokes opposition. For him Mark is an epitomising
narrator, a mere satellite of Matthew with no independent light. His terse
<P>
<center>88</center>
<P>
and graphic style makes on Strauss an impression of artificiality. He
refuses to believe this Evangelist when he says that on the first day at
Capernaum "the whole town" (Mark i. 33) came together before Peter's
door, and that, on other occasions (Mark iii. 20, vi. 31), the press was
so great that Jesus and His disciples had no leisure so much as to eat.
"All very improbable traits," he remarks, "the absence of which in Matthew is entirely to his advantage for what else are they than legendary
exaggerations?" In this criticism he is at one with Schleiermacher, who
in his essay on Luke [1] speaks of the unreal vividness of Mark "which
often gives his Gospel an almost apocryphal aspect."
<P>
This prejudice against Mark has a twofold cause. In the first place,
this Gospel with its graphic details had rendered great service to the
rationalistic explanation of miracle. Its description of the cure of the
blind man at Bethsaida (Mark viii. 22-26)—whose eyes Jesus first
anointed with spittle, whereupon he at first saw things dimly, and then,
after he had felt the touch of the Lord's hand upon his eyes a second
time, saw more clearly—was a veritable treasure-trove for rationalism.
As Strauss is disposed to deal much more peremptorily with the ration-
alists than with the supernaturalists, he puts Mark upon his trial, as
their accessory before the fact, and pronounces upon him a judgment
which is not entirely unprejudiced. Moreover, it is not until the Gospels
are looked at from the point of view of the plan of the history and the
inner connexion of events that the superiority of Mark is clearly realised.
But this way of looking at the matter does not enter into Strauss's purview. On the contrary, he denies that there is any traceable connexion
of events at all, and confines his attention to determining the proportion
if myth in the content of each separate narrative.
<P>
Of the Synoptic question he does not, strictly speaking, take any
account. That was partly due to the fact that when he wrote it was in a
thoroughly unsatisfactory position. There was a confused welter of the
most various hypotheses. The priority of Mark, which had had earlier
champions in Koppe, [2] Storr, [3] Gratz, [4] and Herder, [5] was now maintained
by Credner and Lachmann, who saw in Matthew a combination of the
logia-document with Mark. The "primitive Gospel" hypothesis of Eichhorn, according to which the first three Gospels went back to a common

source, not identical with any of them, had become somewhat discredited. There had been much discussion and various modifications of
Griesbach's "dependence theory," according to which Mark was pieced
together out of Matthew and Luke, and Schleiermacher's <i>Diegesentheorie</i>, [1] which saw the primary material not in a gospel, but in unconnected notes; from these, collections of narrative passages were afterwards formed, which in the post-apostolic period coalesced into continuous descriptions of the life of Jesus such as the three which have
been preserved in our Synoptic Gospels.
<P>
In this matter Strauss is a sceptical eclectic. In the main he may be
said to combine Griesbach's theory of the secondary origin of Mark with
Schleiermacher's <i>Diegesentheorie</i>, the latter answering to his method of
treating the sections separately. But whereas Schleiermacher had used
the plan of John's Gospel as a framework into which to fit the independent narratives, Strauss's rejection of the Fourth Gospel left him
without any means of connecting the sections. He makes a point, indeed,
of sharply emphasising this want of connexion; and it was just this that
made his work appear so extreme.
<P>
The Synoptic discourses, like the Johannine, are composite structures,
created by later tradition out of sayings which originally belonged to
different times and circumstances, arranged under certain leading ideas
so as to form connected discourses. The sermon on the mount, the discourse at the sending forth of the twelve, the great parable-discourse,
the polemic against the Pharisees, have all been gradually formed like
geological deposits. So far as the original juxtaposition may be supposed to have been here and there preserved, Matthew is doubtless the
most trustworthy authority for it. "From the comparison which we have
been making," says Strauss in one passage, "we can already see that
the hard grit of these sayings of Jesus (die kornigen Reden Jesu) has
not indeed been dissolved by the flood of oral tradition, but they have
often been washed away from their original position and like rolling
pebbles (Gerolle) have been deposited in places to which they do not
properly belong." [2] And, moreover, we find this distinction between the
first three Evangelists, viz. that Matthew is a skilful collector who, while
he is far from having been able always to give the original connexion,
has at least known how to bring related passages aptly together, whereas
in the other two many fragmentary sayings have been left exactly where
chance had deposited them, which was generally in the interstices be-

tween the larger masses of discourse. Luke, indeed, has in some cases
made an effort to give them an artistic setting, which is, however, by no
means a satisfactory substitute for the natural connexion.
<P>
It is in his criticism of the parables that Strauss is most extreme. He
Starts out from the assumption that they have mutually influenced one
another, and that those which may possibly be genuine have only been
preserved in a secondary form. In the parable of the marriage supper
of the king's son, for example, he confidently assumes that the conduct
of the invited guests, who finally ill-treated and slew the messengers, and
the question why the guest is not wearing a wedding-garment are secondary features.
<P>
How external he supposes the connexion of the narratives to be is
clear from the way in which he explains the juxtaposition of the story
of the transfiguration with the "discourse while descending the mountain." They have, he says, really nothing to do with one another. The
disciples on one occasion asked Jesus about the coming of Elijah as
forerunner; Elijah also appears in the story of the transfiguration:
accordingly tradition simply grouped the transfiguration and the discourse together under the heading "Elijah," and, later on, manufactured
a connexion between them.
<P>
The tendency of the work to purely critical analysis, the ostentatious
avoidance of any positive expression of opinion, and not least, the man-
ner of regarding the Synoptists as mere bundles of narratives and discourses, make it difficult—indeed, strictly speaking, impossible—to determine Strauss's own distinctive conception of the life of Jesus, to
discover what he really thinks is moving behind the curtain of myth.
According to the view taken in regard to this point his work becomes
either a negative or a positive life of Jesus. There are, for instance, a
number of incidental remarks which contain the suggestion of a positive construction of the life of Jesus. If they were taken out of their context and brought together they would yield a picture which would have
points of contact with the latest eschatological view. Strauss, however,
deliberately restricts his positive suggestions to these few detached remarks. He follows out no line to its conclusion. Each separate problem
is indeed considered, and light is thrown upon it from various quarters
with much critical skill. But he will not venture on a solution of any of
them. Sometimes, when he thinks he has gone too far in the way of
positive suggestion, he deliberately wipes it all out again with some expression of scepticism.
<P>
As to the duration of the ministry he will not even offer a vague conjecture. As to the connexion of certain events, nothing can, according
to him, be known, since the Johannine outline cannot be accepted and
the Synoptists arrange everything with an eye to analogies and associa-
<P>
<center>91</center>
<P>
tion of ideas, though they flattered themselves that they were giving a
chronologically arranged narrative. From the contents of the narratives,
however, and from the monotonous recurrence of certain formulae of
connexion, it is evident that no clear view of an organically connected
whole can be assumed to be present in their work. We have no fixed
points to enable us to reconstruct even in a measure the chronological
order.
<P>
Especially interesting is his discussion of the title "Son of Man." In
the saying "the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath day" (Matt.
xii. 8), the expression might, according to Strauss, simply denote "man."
In other passages one gets the impression that Jesus spoke of the Son of
Man as a supernatural person, quite distinct from Himself, but identified
with the Messiah. This is the most natural explanation of the passage
in Matt. x. 23, where he promises the disciples, in sending them forth,
that they shall not have gone over the cities of Israel before the Son of
Man shall come. Here Jesus speaks of the Messiah as if He Himself were
his forerunner. These sayings would, therefore, fall in the first period,
before He knew Himself to be the Messiah. Strauss does not suspect the
significance of this incidental remark; it contains the germ of the solution of the problem of the Son of Man on the lines of Johannes Weiss.
But immediately scepticism triumphs again. How can we tell, asks
Strauss, where the title Son of Man is genuine in the sayings of Jesus,
and where it has been inserted without special significance, merely from
habit?
<P>
Not less insoluble, in his opinion, is the question regarding the point
of time at which Jesus claimed the Messianic dignity for Himself.
"Whereas in John," Strauss remarks, "Jesus remains constant in His
avowal, his disciples and followers constant in their conviction, that He
is the Messiah; in the Synoptics, on the other hand, there are, so to
speak, relapses to be observed; so that, in the case of the disciples and
the people generally, the conviction of Jesus' Messiahship expressed on
earlier occasions, sometimes, in the course of the narrative, disappears
again and gives place to a much lower view of Him; and even Jesus
Himself, in comparison with His earlier unambiguous declaration, is
more reserved on later occasions." The account of the confession of the
Messiahship at Caesarea Philippi, where Jesus pronounces Peter blessed
because of his confession, and at the same time forbids the Twelve to
speak of it, is unintelligible, since according to this same Gospel His
Messiahship had been mooted by the disciples on several previous occasions, and had been acknowledged by the demoniacs. The Synoptists,
therefore, contradict themselves. Then there are the further cases in
which Jesus forbids the making known of His Messiahship, without any
reason whatever. It would, no doubt, be historically possible to assume
<P>
<center>92</center>
<P>
that it only gradually dawned upon Him that He was the Messiah—in
any case not until after His baptism by John, as otherwise He would
have to be supposed to have made a pretence upon that occasion—and
that as often as the thought that He might be the Messiah was aroused in
others by something that occurred, and was suggested to Him from
without. He was immediately alarmed at hearing spoken, aloud and
definitely, that which He Himself had scarcely dared to cherish as a
possibility, or in regard to which He had only lately attained to a clear
conviction.
<P>
From these suggestions one thing is evident, namely, that for Strauss
the Messianic consciousness of Jesus was an historical fact, and is not
to be referred, as has sometimes been supposed, to myth. To assert that
Strauss dissolved the life of Jesus into myth is, in fact, an absurdity
which, however often it may be repeated by people who have not read
his book, or have read it only superficially, does not become any the less
absurd by repetition.
<P>
To come to detail, Jesus thought of His Messiahship, according to
Strauss, in the form that He, although of human parentage, should after
His earthly life be taken up into heaven, and thence should come again
to bring in His Kingdom. "As, moreover, in the higher Jewish theology,
immediately after the time of Jesus, the idea of the pre-existence of the
Messiah was present, the conjecture naturally suggests itself that it was
also present at the time when Jesus' thoughts were being formed, and
that consequently, if He once began to think of Himself as the Messiah,
He might also have referred to Himself this feature of the Messianic conception. Whether Jesus had been initiated, as Paul was, into the wisdom
of the schools in such a way that He could draw this conception from
it, is no doubt open to question."
<P>
In his treatment of the eschatology Strauss makes a valiant effort to
escape from the dilemma "either spiritual or political" in regard to the
Messianic plans of Jesus, and to make the eschatological expectation
intelligible as one which did not set its hopes upon human aid, but on
Divine intervention. This is one of the most important contributions to
a real understanding of the eschatological problem. Sometimes one almost seems to be reading Johannes Weiss; as, for example, when Strauss
explains that Jesus could promise His followers that they should sit on
thrones without thinking of a political revolution, because He expected
a reversal of present conditions to be brought about by God, and referred
this judicial authority and kingly rule to the time of the <font face="Symbol">paliggenesia</font>.
"Jesus, therefore, certainly expected to restore the throne of David, and,
with His disciples, to rule over a people freed from political bondage,
but in this expectation He did not set His hopes on the sword of human
followers (Luke xxii. 38, Matt. xxvi. 52), but upon the legions of angels
<P>
<center>93</center>
<P>
which His heavenly Father could give Him (Matt. xxvi. 53). When He
speaks of the coming of His Messianic glory, it is with angels and
heavenly powers that He surrounds Himself (Matt. xvi. 27, xxiv. 30 ff.,
xxv. 31). Before the majesty of the Son of Man coming in the clouds of
heaven the nations will submit without striking a blow, and at the sound
of the angel's trumpet-blast will, with the dead who shall then arise,
range themselves before Him and His disciples for judgment. All this
Jesus did not purpose to bring about by any arbitrary action of His own,
but left it to His heavenly Father, who alone knew the right moment for
this catastrophic change (Mark xiii. 32), to give Him the signal of its
coming; and He did not waver in His failh even when death came upon
Him before its realisation. Any one who shrinks from adopting this
view of the Messianic background of Jesus' plans, because he fears by
so doing to make Jesus a visionary enthusiast, must remember how exactly these hopes corresponded to the long-cherished Messianic expectation of the Jews; and how easily, on the supernaturalislic assump-
tions of the period and among a people which preserved so strict an isolation as the Jews, an ideal which was in itself fantastic, if it were the
national ideal and had some true and good features, could take posses-
sion of the mind even of one who was not inclined to fanaticism."
<P>
One of the principal proofs that the preaching of Jesus was eschatologically conditioned is the Last Supper. "When," says Strauss, "He
concluded the celebration with the saying, 'I will not drink henceforth
of the fruit of the vine until I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom,' He would seem to have expected that in the Messianic kingdom the
Passover would be celebrated with peculiar solemnity. Therefore, in
assuring them that they shall next partake of the Feast, not in the present
age, but in the new era. He evidently expects that within a year's time
the pre-Messianic dispensation will have come to an end and the Messianic age will have begun." But it must be admitted, Strauss immediately
adds, that the definite assurance which the Evangelists put into His mouth
may after all only have been in reality an expression of pious hope. In a
similar way he qualifies his other statements regarding the eschatological ideas of Jesus by recalling that we cannot determine the part which
the expectations of primitive Christianity may have had in moulding
these sayings.
<P>
Thus, for example, the opinions which he expresses on the great
Parousia discourse in Matt. xxiv. are extremely cautious. The detailed
prophecies regarding the Second Coming which the Synoptists put into
the mouth of Jesus cannot be derived from Jesus Himself. The question
suggests itself, however, whether He did not cherish the hope, and make
the promise, that He would one day appear in glory as the Messiah?
"If in any period of His life He held Himself to be the Messiah—and
<P>
<center>94</center>
<P>
that there was a period when He did so there can be no doubt—and if
He described Himself as the Son of Man, He must have expected the coming in the clouds which Daniel had ascribed to the Son of Man; but it
may be questioned whether He thought of this as an exaltation which
should take place even in His lifetime, or as something which was only
to take place after His death. Utterances like Matt. x. 23, xvi. 28 rather
suggest the former, but the possibility remains that later, when He had
begun to feel that His death was certain, His conception took the latter
form, and that Matt. xxvi. 64 was spoken with this in view." Thus, even
for Strauss, the problem of the Son of Man is already the central problem in which are focused all the questions regarding the Messiahship
and eschatology.
<P>
From all this it may be seen how strongly he had been influenced by
Reimarus, whom, indeed, he frequently mentions. It would be still more
evident if he had not obscured his historical views by constantly bringing the mythological explanation into play.
<P>
The thought of the supernatural realisation of the Kingdom of God
must also, according to Strauss, be the starting-point of any attempt to
understand Jesus' attitude towards the Law and the Gentiles, so far as
that is possible in view of the conflicting data. The conservative passages
must carry most weight. They need not necessarily fall at the beginning
of His ministry, because it is questionable whether the hypothesis of a
later period of increasing liberality in regard to the law and the Gentiles
can be made probable. There would be more chance of proving that the
conservative sayings are the only authentic ones, for unless all the indications are misleading the terminus a quo for this change of attitude
is the death of Jesus. He no doubt looked forward to the abolition of
the Law and the removal of the barriers between Jew and Gentile, but
only in the future Kingdom. "If that be so," remarks Strauss, "the difference between the views of Jesus and of Paul consisted only in this,
that while Jesus expected these limitations to fall away when, at His
second coming, the earth should be renewed, Paul believed himself justified in doing away with them in consequence of the first coming of the
Messiah, upon the still unregenerated earth."
<P>
The eschatological passages are therefore the most authentic of all.
If there is anything historic about Jesus, it is His assertion of the claim
that in the coming Kingdom He would be manifested as the Son of Man.
<P>
On the other hand, in the predictions of the passion and resurrection
we are on quite uncertain ground. The detailed statements regarding the
manner of the catastrophe place it beyond doubt that we have here
<i>vaticinia ex eventu</i>. Otherwise the despair of the disciples when the
events occurred could not be explained. Yet it is possible that Jesus had
a prevision of His death. Perhaps the resolve to die was essential to His
<P>
<center>95</center>
<P>
conception of the Messiahship and He was not forced thereto by circumstances. This we might be able to determine with certainty if we had
more exact information regarding the conception of the suffering Messiah in contemporary Jewish theology; which is, however, not available.
We do not even know whether the conception had ever existed in
Judaism. "In the New Testament it almost looks as if no one among the
Jews had ever thought of a suffering or dying Messiah." The conception
can, however, certainly be found in later passages of Rabbinic literature.
<P>
The question is therefore insoluble. We must be content to work with
possibilities. The result of a full discussion of the resolve to suffer and
the significance attached to the suffering is summed up by Strauss in the
following sentences. "In view of these considerations it is possible that
Jesus might, by a natural process of thought, have come to see how
greatly such a catastrophe would contribute to the spiritual development of His disciples, and in accordance with national conceptions, interpreted in the light of some Old Testament passages, might have arrived
at the idea of an atoning power in His Messianic death. At the same
time the explicit utterance which the Synoptists attribute to Jesus describing His death as an atoning sacrifice, might well belong rather to
the system of thought which grew up after the death of Jesus, and the
saying which the Fourth Gospel puts into His mouth regarding the relation of His death to the coming of the Paraclete might seem to be
prophecy after the event. So that even in these sayings of Jesus regarding
ths purpose of His death, it is necessary to distinguish between the particular and the general."
<P>
Strauss's "Life of Jesus" has a different significance for modern theology from that which it had for his contemporaries. For them it was
the work which made an end of miracle as a matter of historical belief,
and gave the mythological explanation its due.
<P>
We, however, find in it also an historical aspect of a positive character, inasmuch as the historic Personality which emerges from the mist
of myth is a Jewish claimant of the Messiahship, whose world of thought
is purely eschatological. Strauss is, therefore, no mere destroyer of untenable solutions, but also the prophet of a coming advance in knowledge.
<P>
It was, however, his own fault that his merit in this respect was not
recognised in the nineteenth century, because in his "Life of Jesus for
the German People" (1864), where he undertook to draw a positive
historic picture of Jesus, he renounced his better opinions of 1835,
eliminated eschatology, and, instead of the historic Jesus, portrayed the
Jesus of liberal theology.
