<P>
"MY HOPE IS," WRITES STRAUSS IN CONCLUDING THE PREFACE OF HIS NEW
Life of Jesus, "that I have written a book as thoroughly well adapted for
Germans as Renan's is for Frenchmen." He was mistaken; in spite
<P>
<center>194</center>
<P>
of its title the book was not a book for the people. It had nothing new
to offer, and what it did offer was not in a form calculated to become
popular. It is true Strauss, like Renan, was an artist, but he did not
write, like an imaginative novelist, with a constant eye to effect. His
art was unpretentious, even austere, appealing to the few, not to the
many. The people demand a complete and vivid picture. Renan had
given them a figure which was theatrical no doubt, but full of life and
movement, and they had been grateful to him for it. Strauss could not
do that.
<P>
Even the arrangement of the work is thoroughly unfortunate. In the
first part, which bears the title "The Life of Jesus," he attempts to
combine into a harmonious portrait such of the historical data as have some
claim to be considered historical; in the second part he traces the
"Origin and Growth of the Mythical History of Jesus." First, therefore,
he tears down from the tree the ivy and the rich growth of creepers
laying bare the worn and corroded bark; then he fastens the faded
growths to the stem again, and describes the nature, origin, and
characteristics of each distinct species.
<P>
How vastly different, how much more full of life, had been the work
of 1835! There Strauss had not divided the creepers from the stem.
The straining strength which upheld this wealth of creepers was but
vaguely suspected. Behind the billowy mists of legend we caught from
time to time a momentary glimpse of the gigantic figure of Jesus, as
though lit up by a lightning-flash. It was no complete and harmonious
picture, but it was full of suggestions, rich in thoughts thrown out
carelessly, rich in contradictions even, out of which the imagination
could create a portrait of Jesus. It is just this wealth of suggestion that
is lacking in the second picture. Strauss is trying now to give a definite
portrait. In the inevitable process of harmonising and modelling to
scale he is obliged to reject the finest thoughts of the previous work
because they will not fit in exactly; some of them are altered out of
recognition, some are filed away.
<P>
There is wanting, too, that perfect freshness as of the spring which
is only found when thoughts have but newly come into flower. The
writing is no longer spontaneous; one feels that Strauss is setting forth
thoughts which have ripened with his mind and grown old with it, and
now along with their definiteness of form have taken on a certain
stiffness. There are now no hinted possibilities, full of promise, to dance
gaily through the movement of his dialectic; all is sober reason--a
thought too sober. Renan had one advantage over Strauss in that he
wrote when the material was fresh to him-one might almost say
strange to him-and was capable of calling up in him the response of
vivid feeling.
<P>
<center>195</center>
<P>
For a popular book, too, it lacks that living interplay of reflection
with narration without which the ordinary reader fails to get a grip
of the history. The first Life of Jesus had been rich in this respect,
since it had been steeped in the Hegelian theory regarding the
realisation of the Idea. In the meantime Strauss had seen the Hegelian
philosophy fall from its high estate, and himself had found no way of
reconciling history and idea, so that his present Life of Jesus was a
mere objective presentment of the history. It was, therefore, not adapted
to make any impression upon the popular mind.
<P>
In reality it is merely an exposition, in more or less popular form,
of the writer's estimate of what had been done in the study of the
subject during the past thirty years, and shows what he had learnt and
what he had failed to learn.
<P>
As regards the Synoptic question he had learnt nothing. In his
opinion the criticism of the Gospels has "run to seed." He treats with
a pitying contempt both the earlier and the more recent defenders of
the Marcan hypothesis. Weisse is a dilettante; Wilke had failed to
make any impression on him; Holtzmann's work was as yet unknown to
him. But in the following year he discharged the vials of his wrath upon
the man who had both strengthened the foundations and put on the
coping-stone of the new hypothesis. "Our lions of St. Mark, older and
younger," he says in the appendix to his criticism of Schleiermacher's
Life of Jesus, "may roar as loud as they like, so long as there are six
solid reasons against the priority of Mark to set against every one of
their flimsy arguments in its favour-and they themselves supply us
with a store of counter-arguments in the shape of admissions of later
editing and so forth. The whole theory appears to me a temporary
aberration, like the 'music of the future' or the anti-vaccination movement;
and I seriously believe that it is the same order of mind which, in
different circumstances, falls a victim to the one delusion or the other."
But he must not be supposed, he says, to take the critical mole-hills
thrown up by Holtzmann for veritable mountains.
<P>
Against such opponents he does not scruple to seek aid from
Schleiermacher, whose unbiased but decided opinion had ascribed a tertiary
character to Mark. Even Gfrorer's view that Mark adapted his Gospel
he needs of the Church by leaving out everything which was open
to objection in Matthew and Luke, is good enough to be brought to
bear against the bat-eyed partisans of Mark. F. C. Baur is reproached
for having given too much weight to the "tendency" theory in his
criticism of the Gospels; and also for having taken suggestions of
Strauss's and worked them out, supposing that he was offering
something new when he was really only amplifying. In the end he had only
given a criticism of the Gospels, not of the Gospel history.
<P>
<center>196</center>
<P>
But this irritation against his old teacher is immediately allayed
when he comes to speak of the Fourth Gospel. Here the teacher has
carried to a successful issue the campaign which the pupil had begun.
Strauss feels compelled to "express his gratitude for the work done by
the Tubingen school on the Johannine question." He himself had only
been able to deal with the negative side of the question-to show that
the Fourth Gospel was not an historical source, but a theological invention;
they had dealt with it positively, and had assigned the document
to its proper place in the evolution of Christian thought. There is
only one point with which he quarrels. Baur had made the Fourth
Gospel too completely spiritual, "whereas the fact is," says Strauss,
"that it is the most material of all." It is true, Strauss explains, that
the Evangelist starts out to interpret miracle and eschatology symbolically;
but he halts half-way and falls back upon the miraculous,
enhancing the professed fact in proportion as he makes it spiritually
more significant. Beside the spiritual return of Jesus in the Paraclete
he places His return in a material body, bearing the marks of the
wounds; beside the inward present judgment, a future outward judgment;
and the fact that he sees the one in the other, finds the one
present and visible in the other, is just what constitutes the mystical
character of his Gospel. This mysticism attracts the modern world.
"The Johannine Christ, who in His descriptions of Himself seems to
be always out-doing Himself, is the counterpart of the modern believer,
who in order to remain a believer must continually out-do himself; the
Johannine miracles which are always being interpreted spiritually, and
at the same time raised to a higher pitch of the miraculous, which are
counted and documented in every possible way, and yet must not be
considered the true ground of faith, are at once miracles and no
miracles. We must believe them, and yet can believe without them; in
short they exactly meet the taste of the present day, which delights to
involve itself in contradictions and is too lethargic and wanting in
courage for any clear insight or decided opinion on religious matters.
<P>
Strictly speaking, however, the Strauss of the second Life of Jesus
has no right to criticise the Fourth Gospel for sublimating the history,
for he himself gives what is nothing else than a spiritualisation of the
Jesus of the Synoptics. And he does it in such an arbitrary fashion that
one is compelled to ask how far he does it with a good conscience. A
typical case is the exposition of Jesus' answer to the Baptist's message-"Is it possible,"
Jesus means, "that you fail to find in Me the miracles
which you expect from the Messiah? And yet I daily open the eyes of
the spiritually blind and the ears of the spiritually deaf, make the lame
walk erect and vigorous, and even give new life to those who are morally
dead. Any one who understands how much greater these spiritual
<P>
<center>197</center>
<P>
miracles are, will not be offended at the absence of bodily miracles;
only such an one can receive, and is worthy of, the salvation which I
am bringing to mankind."
<P>
Here the fundamental weakness of his method is clearly shown. The
vaunted apparatus for the evaporation of the mythical does not work
quite satisfactorily. The ultimate product of this process was expected
to be a Jesus who should be essential man; the actual product, however,
is Jesus the historical man, a being whose looks and sayings are strange
and unfamiliar. Strauss is too purely a critic, too little of the creative
historian, to recognise this strange being. That Jesus really lived in a
world of Jewish ideas and held Himself to be Messiah in the Jewish
sense is for the writer of the Life of Jesus an impossibility. The deposit
which resists the chemical process for the elimination of myth, he must
therefore break up with the hammer.
<P>
How different from the Strauss of 1835! He had then recognised
eschatology as the most important element in Jesus' world of thought,
and in some incidental remarks had made striking applications of it.
He had, for example, proposed to regard the Last Supper not as the
institution of a feast for coming generation, but as a Paschal meal,
at which Jesus declared that He would next partake of the Paschal
bread and Paschal wine along with His disciples in the heavenly kingdom.
In the second Life of Jesus this view is given up; Jesus did found
a feast. "In order to give a living centre of unity to the society which it
was His purpose to found, Jesus desired to institute this distribution of
bread and wine as a feast to be constantly repeated." One might be
reading Renan. This change of attitude is typical of much else.
<P>
Strauss is not in the least disquieted by finding himself at one with
Schleiermacher in these attempts to spiritualise. On the contrary, he
appeals to him. He shares, he says, Schleiermacher's conviction "that
the unique self-consciousness of Jesus did not develop as a consequence
of His conviction that He was the Messiah; on the contrary, it was a
consequence of His self-consciousness that He arrived at the view that
the Messianic prophecies could point to no one but Himself." The
moment eschatology entered into the consciousness of Jesus it came in
contact with a higher principle which over-mastered it and gradually
dissolved it.  "Had Jesus applied the Messianic idea to Himself before He had
had a profound religious consciousness to which to relate it, doubtless
it would have taken possession of Him so powerfully that He could never have escaped
its influence."  We must suppose the ideality, the concentration upon that which was inward, the determination
to separate religion, on the one hand, from politics, and on the other,
from ritual, the serene consciousness of being able toa ttain to peace
with God and with Himself by purely spiritual means - all this we must
<P>
<center>198</center>
<P>
suppose to have reached a certain ripeness, a certain security in th
mind of Jesus, before He permitted Himself to entertain the thought
of His Messiahship, and this we may believe is the reason why He
grasped it in so independent and individual a fashion. In this, therefore
Strauss has become the pupil of Weisse.
<P>
Even in the Old Testament prophecies, he explains, we find two
conceptions, a more ideal and a more practical. Jesus holds consistently
to the first, He describes Himself as the Son of Man because this designation
"contains the suggestion of humility and lowliness, of the human
and natural." At Jerusalem, Jesus, in giving His interpretation of
Psalm cx., "made merry over the Davidic descent of the Messiah." He
desired "to be Messiah in the sense of a patient teacher exercising a
quiet influence." As the opposition of the people grew more intense
He took up some of the features of Isaiah liii. into His conception of
the Messiah.
<P>
Of His resurrection, Jesus can only have spoken in a metaphorical
sense. It is hardly credible that one who was pure man could have
arrogated to himself the position of judge of the world. Strauss would
like best to ascribe all the eschatology to the distorting medium of early
Christianity, but he does not venture to carry this through with logical
consistency. He takes it as certain, however, that Jesus, even though it
sometimes seems as if He did not expect the Kingdom to be realised in
the present, but in a future, world-era, and to be brought about by God
in a supernatural fashion, nevertheless sets about the establishment of
the Kingdom by purely spiritual influence.
<P>
With this end in view He leaves Galilee, when He judges the time
to be ripe, in order to work on a larger scale. "In case of an unfavourable
issue, He reckons on the influence which a martyr-death has never
failed to exercise in giving momentum to a lofty idea." How far He
had advanced, when He entered on the fateful journey to Jerusalem, in
shaping His plan, and especially in organising the company of
adherents who had gathered about Him, it is impossible to determine with
anv exactness. He permitted the triumphal entry because He did not
desire to decline the role of the Messiah in every aspect of it.
<P>
Owing to this arbitrary spiritualisation of the Synoptic Jesus, Strauss's
picture is in essence much more unhistorical than Renan's. The latter
had not needed to deny that Jesus had done miracles, and he had been
able to suggest an explanation of how Jesus came in the end to fall back
upon the eschatological system of ideas. But at what a price! By portraying
Jesus as at variance with Himself, a hero broken in spirit. This
price is too high for Strauss. Arbitrary as his treatment of history is,
he never loses the intuitive feeling that in Jesus' self-consciousness there
is a unique absence of struggle; that He does not bear the scars which
<P>
<center>199</center>
<P>
are found in those natures which win their way to freedom and purity
through strife and conflict, that in Him there is no trace of the hardness,
harshness, and gloom which cleave to such natures throughout
life, but that He "is manifestly a beautiful nature from the first." Thus,
for all Strauss's awkward, arbitrary handling of the history he is greater
than the rival [1] who could manufacture history with such skill.
<P>
Nevertheless, from the point of view of theological science, this work
marks a standstill. That was the net result of the thirty years of critical
study of the life of Jesus for the man who had inaugurated it so impressively.
This was the only fruit which followed those blossoms so
full of promise of the first Life of Jesus.
<P>
It is significant that in the same year there appeared Schleiermacher's
lectures on the Life of Jesus, which had not seen the light for forty years,
because, as Strauss himself remarked in his criticism of the resurrected
work, it had neither anodyne nor dressing for the wounds which his
first Life of Jesus had made. [2] The wounds, however, had cicatrised in
the meantime. It is true Strauss is a just judge, and makes ample
acknowledgment of the greatness of Schleiermacher's achievement. [3] He
blames Schleiermacher for setting up his "presuppositions in regard to
Christ" as an historical canon, and considering it a proof that a statement
is unhistorical if it does not square with those presuppositions.
But does not the purely human, but to a certain extent unhistorical,
man, who is to be the ultimate product of the process of eliminating
myth, serve Strauss as his "theoretic Christ" who determines the presentment
of his historical Jesus? Does he not share with Schleiermacher
the erroneous, artificial, "double" construction of the consciousness of
<P>
[1] Strauss's second Life of Jesus appeared in French in 1864.
<P>
[2] "I can now say without incurring the reproach of self-glorification, and almost
without needing to fear contradiction, that if my Life of Jesus had not appeared in
the year after Schleiermacher's death, his would not have been withheld for so long.
Up to that time it would have been hailed by the theological world as a deliverer;
but for the wounds which my work inflicted on the theology of the day, it had
neither anodyne nor dressing; nay, it displayed the author as in a measure responsible
for the disaster, for the waters which he had admitted drop by drop were
now in defiance of his prudent reservations, pouring in like a flood."-From the
introduction to <i>The Christ of Faith and the Jesus of History</i>, 1865.
<P>
[3] "Now that Schleiermacher's Life of Jesus at last lies before us in print, all
parties can gather about it in heartfelt rejoicing. The appearance of a work by
Schleiermacher is always an enrichment to literature. Any product of a mind like
his cannot fail to shed light and life on the minds of others. And of works of this
kind our theological literature has certainly in these days no superfluity. Where the
living are for the most part as it were dead, it is meet that the dead should arise
and bear witness. These lectures of Schleiermacher's, when compared with the work
of his pupils, show clearly that the great theologian has let fall upon them only his
mantle and not his spirit."-<i>Ibid.</i>
<P>
<center>200</center>
<P>
Jesus? And what about their views of Mark? What fundamental difference
is there, when all is said, between Schleiermacher's de-rationalised
Life of Jesus and Strauss's? Certainly this second Life of Jesus would
not have frightened Schleiermacher's away into hiding for thirty years.
<P>
So Schleiermacher's Life of Jesus might now safely venture forth
into the light. There was no reason why it should feel itself a stranger
at this period, and it had no need to be ashamed of itself. Its rationalistic
birth-marks were concealed by its brilliant dialectic. [1] And the only real
advance in the meantime was the general recognition that the Life of
Jesus was not to be interpreted on rationalistic, but on historical lines.
All other, more definite, historical results had proved more or less
illusory; there is no vitality in them. The works of Renan, Strauss
Schenkel, Weizsacker, and Keim are in essence only different ways of
carrying out a single ground-plan. To read them one after another is
to be simply appalled at the stereotyped uniformity of the world of
thought in which they move. You feel that you have read exactly the
same thing in the others, almost in identical phrases. To obtain the
works of Schenkel and Weizsacker you only need to weaken down in
Strauss the sharp discrimination between John and the Synoptists so
far as to allow of the Fourth Gospel being used to some extent as an
historical source "in the higher sense," and to put the hypothesis of the
priority of Mark in place of the Tubingen view adopted by Strauss. The
latter is an external operation and does not essentially modify the
view of the Life of Jesus, since by admitting the Johannine scheme
the Marcan plan is again disturbed, and Strauss's arbitrary spiritualisation
of the Synoptics comes to something not very different from the
acceptance of that "in a higher sense historical Gospel" alongside of
them. The whole discussion regarding the sources is only loosely connected
with the process of arriving at the portrait of Jesus, since this
portrait is fixed from the first, being determined by the mental
atmosphere and religious horizon of the 'sixties. They all portray the Jesus
of liberal theology; the only difference is that one is a little more
conscientious in his colouring than another, and one perhaps has a little
more taste than another, or is less concerned about the consequences.

forms vol. ix. of his <i>Bibelwerk</i>. (Edited by Holtzmann, 1865.) He accepts the
Fourth Gospel as an historical source and treats the question of miracle as not yet
settled. Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen, born in 1791 at Korbach in Waldeck,
was Prussian ambassador at Rome, Berne, and London, and settled later in Heidelberg.
He was well read in theology and philology, and gradually came, in spite
of his friendly relations with Friedrich Wilhelm IV., to entertain more liberal views
on religion. The issue of his <i>Bibelwerk fur die Gemeinde</i> was begun in 1858. He
died in 1860. (Best known in England as the Chevalier Bunsen.)

Synoptists and John was native to the Marcan hypothesis. Weisse had
endeavored to effect this by distinguishing between the sources in the
Fourth Gospel. [1] Schenkel and Weizsacker are more modest. They do not
feel the need of any clear literary view of the Fourth Gospel, of any
critical discrimination between original and secondary elements in it;
they are content to use as historical whatever their instinct leads them
accept. "Apart from the fourth Gospel," says Schenkel, "we should
miss in the portrait of the Redeemer the unfathomable depths and the
inaccessible heights." "Jesus," to quote his aphorism, "was not always
thus in reality, but He was so in truth." Since when have historians had
the right to distinguish between reality and truth? That was one of the
bad habits which the author of this characterisation of Jesus brought
with him from his earlier dogmatic training.
<P>
Weizsacker [2] expresses himself with more circumspection. "We possess,"
he says, "in the Fourth Gospel genuine apostolic reminiscences as
much as in any part of the first three Gospels; but between the facts on
which the reminiscences are based and their reproduction in literary
form there lies the development of their possessor into a great mystic,
and the influence of a philosophy which here for the first time united
itself in this way with the Gospel; they need, therefore, to be critically
examined; and the historical truth of this gospel, great as it is, must
not be measured with a painful literality."
<P>
One wonders why both these writers appeal to Holtzmann, seeing
that they practically abandon the Marcan plan which he had worked
out at the end of his very thorough examination of this Gospel. They
do not accept as sufficient the controversy regarding the ceremonial
regulations in Mark vii. which, with the rejection at Nazareth, constitute, in Holtzmann's view, the turning-point of the Galilaean ministry,
but find the cause of the change of attitude on the part of the people
rather in the Johannine discourse about eating and drinking the flesh
and blood of the Son of Man. The section Mark x.-xv., which has a

<P>
certain unity, they interpret in the light of the Johannine tradition,
finding in it traces of a previous ministry of Jesus in Jerusalem and
interweaving with it the Johannine story of the Passion. According to
Schenkel the last visit to Jerusalem must have been of considerable
duration. When confronted with John, the admission may be wrung
from the Synoptists that Jesus did not travel straight through Jericho
to the capital, but worked first for a considerable time in Judaea. Strauss
tartly observes that he cannot see what the author of the "characterisation"
stood to gain by underwriting Holtzmann's Marcan hypothesis. [1]
<P>
Weizsacker is still bolder in making interpolations from the Johannine
tradition. He places the cleansing of the Temple, in contradiction
to Mark, in the early period of Jesus' ministry, on the ground that "it
bears the character of a first appearance, a bold deed with which to
open His career." He fails to observe, however, that if this act really
took place at this point of time, the whole development of the life of
Jesus which Holtzmann had so ingeniously traced in Mark, is at once
thrown into confusion. In describing the last visit to Jerusalem, Weizsacker
is not content to insert the Marcan stones into the Johannine
cement; he goes farther and expressly states that the great farewell discourses
of Jesus to His disciples agree with the Synoptic discourses to
the disciples spoken during the last days, however completely they of
all others bear the peculiar stamp of the Johannine diction.
<P>
Thus in the second period of the Marcan hypothesis the same spectacle
meets us as in the earlier. The hypothesis has a literary existence, indeed
it is carried by Holtzmann to such a degree of demonstration that
it can no longer be called a mere hypothesis, but it does not succeed
in winning an assured position in the critical study of the Life of Jesus.
It is common-land not yet taken into cultivation.
<P>
That is due in no small measure to the fact that Holtzmann did not
work out the hypothesis from the historical side, but rather on literary
lines, recalling Wilke-as a kind of problem in Synoptic arithmetic-and
in his preface expresses dissent from the Tubingen school, who desired
to leave no alternative between John on the one side and the
Synoptics on the other, whereas he approves the attempt to evade the
dilemma in some way or other, and thinks he can find in the didactic
narrative of the Fourth Gospel the traces of a development of Jesus
similar to that portrayed in the Synoptics, and has therefore no fundamental
objection to the use of John alongside of the Synoptics. In taking
up this position, however, he does not desire to be understood a
meaning that "it would be to the interests of science to throw Synoptic

<P>
and Johannine passages together indiscriminately and thus construct
a life of Jesus out of them." "It would be much better first to reconstruct
separately the Synoptic and Johannine pictures of Christ, composing
each of its own distinctive material. It is only when this has been done
that it is possible to make a fruitful comparison of the two." Exactly the
same position had been taken up sixty-seven years before by Herder.
In Holtzmann's case, however, the principle was stated with so many
qualifications that the adherents of his view read into it the permission
to combine, in a picture treated "in the grand style," Synoptic with
Johannine passages.
<P>
In addition to this, the plan which Holtzmann finally evolved out of
Mark was much too fine-drawn to bear the weight of the remainder of
the Synoptic material. He distinguishes seven stages in the Galilaean
ministry, [1] of which the really decisive one is the sixth, in which Jesus
leaves Galilee and goes northward, so that Schenkel and Weizsacker
are justified in distinguishing practically only two great Galilaean
periods, the first of which-down to the controversy about ceremonial
purity-they distinguish as the period of success, the second-down to
the departure from Judaea-as the period of decline. What attracted
these writers to the Marcan hypothesis was not so much the
authentification which it gave to the detail of Mark, though they were willing
enough to accept that, but the way in which this Gospel lent itself to
the a priori view of the course of the life of Jesus which they unconsciously
brought with them. They appealed to Holtzmann because
he showed such wonderful skill in extracting from the Marcan narrative
the view which commended itself to the spirit of the age as manifested in
the 'sixties.
<P>
Holtzmann read into this Gospel that Jesus had endeavoured in
Galilee to found the Kingdom of God in an ideal sense; that He concealed
His consciousness of being the Messiah, which was constantly
growing more assured, until His followers should have attained by inner
enlightenment to a higher view of the Kingdom of God and of the
Messiah; that almost at the end of His Galilaean ministry He declared Himself
to them as the Messiah at Caesarea Philippi; that on the same occasion
He at once began to picture to them a suffering Messiah, whose
lineaments gradually became more and more distinct in His mind amid
the growing opposition which He encountered, until finally. He communicated
to his disciples His decision to put the Messianic cause to the test in
the capital, and that they followed Him thither and saw how His fate fulfilled
itself.  It was this fundamental view which made the success of the
hypothesis. Holtzmann, not less than his followers, believed that he had

<center>204</center>
<P>
discovered it in the Gospel itself, although Strauss, the passionate opponent
of the Marcan hypothesis, took essentially the same view of the
development of Jesus' thought. But the way in which Holtzmann exhibited
this characteristic view of the 'sixties as arising naturally out
of the detail of Mark, was so perfect, so artistically charming, that this
view appeared henceforward to be inseparably bound up with the Marcan
tradition. Scarcely ever has a description of the life of Jesus exercised
so irresistible an influence as that short outline-it embraces
scarcely twenty pages-with which Holtzmann closes his examination
of the Synoptic Gospels. This chapter became the creed and catechism
of all who handled the subject during the following decades. The treatment
of the life of Jesus had to follow the lines here laid down until
the Marcan hypothesis was delivered from its bondage to that a priori
view of the development of Jesus. Until then any one might appeal to
the Marcan hypothesis, meaning thereby only that general view of the
inward and outward course of development in the life of Jesus, and
might treat the remainder of the Synoptic material how he chose, combining
with it, at his pleasure, material drawn from John. The victory,
therefore, belonged, not to the Marcan hypothesis pure and simple, but
to the Marcan hypothesis as psychologically interpreted by a liberal
theology.
<P>
The points of distinction between the Weissian and the new interpretation
are as follows:-Weisse is sceptical as regards the detail; the
new Marcan hypothesis ventures to base conclusions even upon incidental
remarks in the text. According to Weisse there were not distinct
periods of success and failure in the ministry of Jesus; the new Marcan
hypothesis confidently affirms this distinction, and goes so far as to
place the sojourn of Jesus in the parts beyond Galilee under the heading
"Flights and Retirements." [1] The earlier Marcan hypothesis ex-
pressly denies that outward circumstances influenced the resolve of
Jesus to die; according to the later, it was the opposition of the people,
and the impossibility of carrying out His mission on other lines which
forced Him to enter on the path of suffering. [2] The Jesus of Weisse's view

<P>
[2] "Thus the course of Jesus' life hastened forward to its tragic close, a close which
was foreseen and predicted by Jesus Himself with ever-growing clearness as the sole
possible close, but also that which alone was worthy of Himself, and which was
necessary as being foreseen and predetermined in the counsel of God. The hatred
of the Pharisees and the indifference of the people left from the first no other
prospect open. That hatred could not but be called forth in the fullest measure
by the ruthless severity with which Jesus exposed all that it was and implied - a
heart in which there was no room for love, a morality inwardly riddled with decay,
an outward show of virtue, a hypocritical arrogance. Between two such unyielding
opponents-a man who, to all appearance, aimed at using the Messianic expectations
of the people for his own ends, and a hierarchy as tenacious of its claims and
as sensitive to their infringement as any that has ever existed-it was certain that
the breach must soon become irreparable. It was easy to foresee, too, that even in
Galilee only a minority of the people would dare to face with Him the danger of
such a breach. There was only one thing that could have averted the death sentence
which had been early determined upon-a series of vigorous, unambiguous demonstrations
on the part of the people. In order to provoke such demonstrations Jesus
would have needed, if only for the moment, to take into His service the popular,
powerful, inflammatory Messianic ideas, or rather, would have needed to place
Himself at their service. His refusal to enter, by so much as a single step, upon this
course, which from any ordinary point of view of human policy would have been
legitimate, because the only practicable one, was the sole sufficient and all-explaining
cause of His destruction."-Holtzmann, <i>Die synoptischen Evangelien</i>, 1863, pp.
485, 486.

<center>205</center>
<P>
has completed His development at the time of His appearance; the Jesus
of the new interpretation of Mark continues to develop in the course
of His public ministry.
<P>
There is complete agreement, however, in the rejection of eschatology.
Fpr Holtzmann, Schenkel, and Weizsacker, as for Weisse, Jesus desires
"to found an inward kingdom of repentance." [1] It was Israel's duty,
according to Schenkel, to believe in the presence of the Kingdom which
Jesus proclaimed. John the Baptist was unable to believe in it, and it
was for this reason that Jesus censured him-for it is in this sense that
Schenkel understands the saying about the greatest among those born
of women who is nevertheless the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. "So
near the light and yet shutting his eyes to its beams-is there not some
blame here, an undeniable lack of spiritual and moral receptivity?"
<P>
Jesus makes Messianic claims only in a spiritual sense. He does not
grasp at super-human glory; it is His purpose to bear the sin of the
whole people, and He undergoes baptism "as a humble member of the
national community."
<P>
His whole teaching consists, when once He Himself has attained to
clear consciousness of His vocation, in a constant struggle to root out
from the hearts of His disciples their theocratic hopes and to effect a
transformation of their traditional Messianic ideas. When, on Simon's
hailing Him as the Messiah, He declares that flesh and blood has not
revealed it to him, He means, according to Schenkel, "that Simon has
at this moment overcome the false Messianic ideas, and has recognised
in Him the ethical and spiritual deliverer of Israel."
<P>
[1] "Ein innerliches Reich der Sinnesanderung." "Sinnesanderung" corresponds
more exactly than "repentance" to the Greek <font face="Symbol">metanoia</font> (change of mind, change of
attitude), but the <i>phrase</i> is no less elliptical in German than in English. The
meaning is doubtless "kingdom based upon repentance, consisting of those who have
fulfilled this condition."
<P>
<center>206</center>
<P>
"That Jesus predicted a personal, bodily, Second Coming in the
brightness of His heavenly splendour and surrounded by the heavenly
hosts, to establish an earthly kingdom, is not only not proved, it is absolutely
impossible." His purpose is to establish a community of which
His disciples are to be the foundation, and by means of this community
to bring about the coming of the Kingdom of God. He can, therefore
only have spoken of His return as an impersonal return in the Spirit.
The later exponents of the Marcan view were no doubt generally inclined
to regard the return as personal and corporeal. For Schenkel
however, it is historically certain that the real meaning of the eschatological
discourses is more faithfully preserved in the Fourth Gospel
than in the Synoptics.
<P>
In his anxiety to eliminate any enthusiastic elements from the representation
of Jesus, he ends by drawing a bourgeois Messiah whom he
might have extracted from the old-fashioned rationalistic work of the
worthy Reinhard. He feels bound to save the credit of Jesus by showing
that the entry into Jerusalem was not intended as a provocation to the
government. "It is only by making this supposition," he explains, "that
we avoid casting a slur upon the character of Jesus. It was certainly a
constant trait in His character that He never unnecessarily exposed
Himself to danger, and never, except for the most pressing reasons, did
He give any support to the suspicions which were arising against Him;
He avoided provoking His opponents to drastic measures by any overt
act directed against them." Even the cleansing of the Temple was not an
act of violence but merely an attempt at reform.
<P>
Schenkel is able to give these explanations because he knows the
most secret thoughts of Jesus and is therefore no longer bound to the
text. He knows, for example, that immediately after His baptism He attained
to the knowledge "that the way of the Law was no longer the
way of salvation for His people." Jesus cannot therefore have uttered
the saying about the permanence of the Law in Mark v. 18. In the controversies
about the Sabbath "He proclaims freedom of worship."
<P>
As time went on, He began to take the heathen world into the scope
of His purpose. "The hard saying addressed to the Canaanite woman
represents rather the proud and exclusive spirit of Pharisaism than the
spirit of Jesus." It was a test of faith, the success of which had a decisive
influence upon Jesus' attitude towards the heathen. Henceforth
it is obvious that He is favourably disposed towards them. He travels
through Samaria and establishes a community there. In Jerusalem He
openly calls the heathen to Him. At certain feasts which they had
arranged for that purpose, some of the leaders of the people set a trap
for Him, and betrayed Him into liberal sayings in regard to the Gentiles
which sealed His fate.
<P>
<center>207</center>
<P>
This was the course of development of the Master, who, according to
Schenkel "saw with a clear eye into the future history of the world,"
and knew that the fall of Jerusalem must take place in order to close
the theocratic era and give the Gentiles free access to the universal
community of Christians which He was to found. "This period He described
as the period of His coming, as in a sense His Second Advent
upon earth.
<P>
The same general procedure is followed by Weizsacker in his "Gospel
History," though his work is of a much higher quality than Schenkel's.
His account of the sources is one of the clearest that has ever been written.
In the description of the life of Jesus, however, the unhesitating
combination of material from the Fourth Gospel with that of the Synoptics
rather confuses the picture. And whereas Renan only offers the
results of the completed process, Weizsacker works out his, it might
almost be said, under the eyes of the reader, which makes the arbitrary
character of the proceeding only the more obvious. But in his attitude
towards the sources Weizsacker is wholly free from the irresponsible
caprice in which Schenkel indulges. From time to time, too, he gives a
hint of unsolved problems in the background. For example, in treating
of the declaration of Jesus to His judges that He would come as the
Son of Man upon the clouds of heaven, he remarks how surprising it
is that Jesus could so often have used the designation Son of Man on
earlier occasions without being accused of claiming the Messiahship.
It is true that this is a mere scraping of the keel upon a sandbank, by
which the steersman does not allow himself to be turned from his course,
for Weizsacker concludes that the name Son of Man, in spite of its use
in Daniel, "had not become a generally current or really popular designation
of the Messiah." But even this faint suspicion of the difficulty is
a welcome sign. Much emphasis, in fact, in practice rather too much
emphasis, is laid on the principle that in the great discourses of Jesus
the structure is not historical; they are only collections of sayings
formed to meet the needs of the Christian community in later times.
In this Weizsacker is sometimes not less arbitrary than Schenkel, who
represents the Lord's Prayer as given by Jesus to the disciples only in
the last days at Jerusalem. It was an axiom of the school that Jesus
could not have delivered discourses such as the Evangelists record.
<P>
If Schenkel's picture of Jesus' character attracted much more attention
than Weizsacker's work, that is mainly due to the art of lively
popular presentation by which it is distinguished. The writer knows
well how to keep the reader's interest awake by the use of exciting
headlines. Catchwords abound, and arrest the ear, for they are the
words about which the religious controversies of the time revolved.
There is never far to look for the moral of the history, and the Jesus
<P>
<center>208</center>
<P>
here portrayed can be imagined plunging into the midst of the debates
in any ministerial conference. The moralising, it must be admitted, sometimes
becomes the occasion of the feeblest ineptitudes. Jesus sent out
His disciples two and two; this is for Schenkel a marvellous exhibition
of wisdom. The Lord designed, thereby, to show that in His opinion
"nothing is more inimical to the interests of the Kingdom of God than
individualism, self-will, self-pleasing." Schenkel entirely fails to recognise
the superb irony of the saying that in this life all that a man gives
up for the sake of the Kingdom of God is repaid a hundredfold in persecutions,
in order that in the Coming Age he may receive eternal life as
his reward. He interpreted it as meaning that the sufferer shall be
compensated by love; his fellow-Christians will endeavour to make it
up to him, and will offer him their own possessions so freely that, in
consequence of this brotherly love, he will soon have, for the house
which he has lost, a hundred houses, for the lost sisters, brothers, and
so forth, a hundred sisters, a hundred brothers, a hundred fathers, a
hundred mothers, a hundred farms. Schenkel forgets to add that, if
this is to be the interpretation of the saying, the persecuted man must
also receive through this compensating love, a hundred wives. [1]
<P>
This want of insight into the largeness, the startling originality, the
self-contradictoriness, and the terrible irony in the thought of Jesus,
is not a peculiarity of Schenkel's; it is characteristic of all the liberal
Lives of Jesus from Strauss's down to Oskar Holtzmann's. [2] How could
it be otherwise? They had to transpose a way of envisaging the world
which belonged to a hero and a dreamer to the plane of thought of a
rational bourgeois religion. But in Schenkel's representation, with its
popular appeal, this banality is particularly obtrusive.
<P>
In the end, however, what made the success of the book was not its
popular characteristics, whether good or bad, but the enmity which it
drew down upon the author. The Basle Privat-Docent who, in his work
of 1839, had congratulated the Zurichers on having rejected Strauss,
now, as Professor and Director of the Seminary at Heidelberg, came
very near being adjudged worthy of the Martyr's crown himself. He
had been at Heidelberg since 1851, after holding for a short time De
Wette's chair at Basle. At his first coming a mildly reactionary theology
might have claimed him as its own. He gave it a right to do so by the
way in which he worked against the philosopher, Kuno Fischer, in tne
Higher Consistory. But in the struggles over the constitution of the
Church he changed his position. As a defender of the rights of the laity
he ranged himself on the more liberal side. After his great victory in
the General Synod of 1861, in which the new constitution of the Church
was established, he called a German Protestant assembly at Franktort,

<P>
<center>209</center>
<P>
in order to set on foot a general movement for Church reform. This
assembly met in 1863, and led to the formation of the Protestant Association.
<P>
When the <i>Charakterbild Jesu</i> appeared, friend and foe were alike
surprised at the thoroughness with which Schenkel advocated the more
liberal views. "Schenkel's book," complained Luthardt, in a lecture at
Leipzig, [1] "has aroused a painful interest. We had learnt to know him
in many aspects; we were not prepared for such an apostasy from his
own past. How long is it since he brought about the dismissal of Kuno
Fischer from Heidelberg because he saw in the pantheism of this philosopher
a danger to Church and State? It is still fresh in our memory that
it was he who in the year 1852 drew up the report of the Theological
Faculty of Heidelberg upon the ecclesiastical controversy raised by
Pastor Dulon at Bremen, in which he denied Dulon's Christianity on
the ground that he had assailed the doctrines of original sin, of justification
by faith, of a living and personal God, of the eternal Divine
Sonship of Christ, of the Kingdom of God, and of the credibility of the
holy Scriptures." And now this same Schenkel was misusing the Life
of Jesus as a weapon in "party polemics"!
<P>
The agitation against him was engineered from Berlin, where his
successful attack upon the illiberal constitution of the Church had not
been forgiven. One hundred and seventeen Baden clerics signed a protest
declaring the author unfitted to hold office as a theological teacher
in the Baden Church. Throughout the whole of Germany the pastors
agitated against him. It was especially demanded that he should be
immediately removed from his post as Director of the Seminary. A
counter-protest was issued by the Durlach Conference in the July of
1864, in which Bluntschli and Holtzmann vigorously defended him.
The Ecclesiastical Council supported him, and the storm gradually died
away, especially when Schenkel in two "Defences" skilfully softened
down the impression made by his work, and endeavoured to quiet the
public mind by pointing out that he had only attempted to set forth one
side of the truth. [2]

The position of the prospective martyr was not rendered any more
easy by Strauss. In an appendix to his criticism of Schleiermacher's
Life of Jesus he settled accounts with his old antagonist. [1] He recognises
no scientific value whatever in the work. None of the ideas developed
in it are new. One might fairly say, he thinks, "that the conclusions
which have given offence had been carried down the Neckar from
Tubingen to Heidelberg, and had there been salvaged by Herr Schenkel-in
a somewhat sodden and deteriorated condition, it must be admitted-and
incorporated into the edifice which he was constructing." Further
Strauss censures the book for its want of frankness, its half-and-half
character, which manifests itself especially in the way in which the
author clings to orthodox phraseology. "Over and over again he gives
criticism with one hand all that it can possibly ask, and then takes
back with the other whatever the interests of faith seem to demand; with
the constant result that what is taken back is far too much for criticism
and not nearly enough for faith." "In the future," he concludes, "it
will be said of the seven hundred Durlachers that they fought like
paladins to prevent the enemy from capturing a standard which was
really nothing but a patched dish-clout."
<P>
Schenkel died in 1885 after severe sufferings. As a critic he lacked
independence, and was, therefore, always inclined to compromises; in
controversy he was vehement. Though he did nothing remarkable in
theology, German Protestantism owes him a vast debt for acting as its
tribune in the 'sixties.
<P>
That was the last time that any popular excitement was aroused in
connexion with the critical study of the life of Jesus; and it was a mere
storm in a tea-cup. Moreover, it was the man and not his work that
aroused the excitement. Henceforth public opinion was almost entirely
indifferent to anything which appeared in this department. The great
fundamental question whether historical criticism was to be applied
to the life of Jesus had been decided in connexion with Strauss's first
work on the subject. If here and there indignation aroused by a Life
of Jesus brought inconveniences to the author and profit to the publisher,
that was connected in every case with purely external and incidental
circumstances. Public opinion was not disquieted for a moment
by Volkmar and Wrede, although they are much more extreme than
Schenkel.

lished during the 'sixties, variants of which the minute differences were
only discernible by theologians, and which were otherwise exactly alike
in arrangement and result. As a contribution to criticism, Keim's [1] "History of Jesus of Nazara" was the most important Life of Jesus which
appeared in a long period.
<P>
It is not of much consequence that he believes in the priority of
Matthew, since his presentment of the history follows the general lines
of the Marcan plan, which is preserved also in Matthew. He gives it as
his opinion that the life of Jesus is to be reconstructed from the Synoptics,
whether Matthew has the first place or Mark. He sketches the development
of Jesus in bold lines. As early as his inaugural address at
Zurich, delivered on the 17th of December 1860, which, short as it was,
made a powerful impression upon Holtzmann as well as upon others,
he had set up the thesis that the Synoptics "artlessly, almost against
their will, show us unconsciously in incidental, unobtrusive traits the
progressive development of Jesus as youth and man." [2] His later works
are the development of this sketch.

His grandiose style gave the keynote for the artistic treatment of the
portrait of Jesus in the 'sixties. His phrases and expressions became
classical. Every one follows him in speaking of the "Galilaean springtide"
in the ministry of Jesus.
<P>
On the Johannine question he takes up a clearly defined position,
denying the possibility of using the Fourth Gospel side by side with the
Synoptics as an historical source. He goes very far in finding special
significance in the details of the Synoptists, especially when he is
anxious to discover traces of want of success in the second period of
Jesus' ministry, since the plan of his Life of Jesus depends on the
sharp antithesis between the periods of success and failure. The whole
of the second half of the Galilaean period consists for him in "flights

and retirements." "Beset by constantly renewed alarms and hindrances
Jesus left the scene of His earlier work, left his dwelling-place at Capernaum,
and accompanied only by a few faithful followers, in the end
only by the Twelve, sought in all directions for places of refuse for
longer or shorter periods, in order to avoid and elude His enemies."
Keim frankly admits, indeed, that there is not a syllable in the Gospels
to suggest that these journeys are the journeys of a fugitive. But instead
of allowing that to shake his conviction, he abuses the narrators and
suggests that they desired to conceal the truth. "These flights," he says
"were no doubt inconvenient to the Evangelists. Matthew is here the
frankest, but in order to restore the impression of Jesus' greatness he
transfers to this period the greatest miracles. The later Evangelists are
almost completely silent about these retirements, and leave us to suppose
that Jesus made His journeys to Caesarea Philippi and the neighbourhood
of Tyre and Sidon in the middle of winter from mere pleasure
in travel, or for the extension of the Gospel, and that He made His
last journey to Jerusalem without any external necessity, entirely in
consequence of His free decision, even though the expectation of death
which they ascribe to Him goes far to counteract the impression of
complete freedom." Why do they thus correct the history? "The motive
was the same difficulty which draws from us also the question, 'Is it
possible that Jesus should flee?'" Keim answers "Yes." Here the liberal
psychology comes clearly to light. "Jesus fled," he explains, "because He
desired to preserve Himself for God and man, to secure the continuance
of His ministry to Israel, to defeat as long as possible the dark designs
of His enemies, to carry His cause to Jerusalem, and there, while
acting, as it was His duty to do, with prudence and foresight in his
relations with men, to recognise clearly, by the Divine silence or the
Divine action, what the Divine purpose really was, which could not be
recognised in a moment. He acts like a man who knows the duty both
of examination and action, who knows His own worth and what is due
to Him and His obligations towards God and man." [1]
<P>
In regard to the question of eschatology, however, Keim does justice
to the texts. [2] He admits that eschatology, "a Kingdom of God clothed
with material splendours," forms an integral part of the preaching of
Jesus from the first; "that He never rejected it, and therefore never by
a so-called advance transformed the sensuous Messianic idea into a
<P>
[1] Geschichte Jesu</i>. 2nd ed., 1875, pp. 228 and 229.                         ,
<P>
[2] The ultimate reason why Keim deliberately gives such prominence to the
eschatology is that he holds to Matthew, and is therefore more under the direct
impression of the masses of discourse in this Gospel, charged, as they are, with
eschatological ideas, than those writers who find their primary authority in Mark,
where these discourses are lacking.
<P>
<center>213</center>
purely spiritual one." "Jesus does not uproot from the minds of the
the sons of Zebedee their belief in the thrones on His right hand and His
left; He does not hesitate to make His entry into Jerusalem in the character
of the Messiah; He acknowledges His Messiahship before the
Council without making any careful reservations; upon the cross His
title is The King of the Jews; He consoles Himself and His followers
with the thought of His return as an earthly ruler, and leaves with His
disciples, without making any attempt to check it, the belief, which long
survived, in a future establishment or restoration of the Kingdom in
an Israel delivered from bondage." Keim remarks with much justice
"that Strauss had been wrong in rejecting his own earlier and more
correct formula," which combined the eschatological and spiritual elements
as operating side by side in the plan of Jesus.
<P>
Keim however, himself in the end allows the spiritual elements practically
to cancel the eschatological. He admits, it is true, that the expression
Son of Man which Jesus uses designated the Messiah in the
sense of Daniel's prophecy, but he thinks that these pictorial representations
in Daniel did not repel Jesus because He interpreted them
spiritually, and "intended to describe Himself as belonging to mankind
even in His Messianic office." To solve the difficulty Keim assumes a
development. Jesus' consciousness of His vocation had been strengthened
both by success and by disappointment. As time went on He
preached the Kingdom not as a future Kingdom, as at first, but as one
which was present in Him and with Him, and He declares His Messiahship
more and more openly before the world. He thinks of the
Kingdom as undergoing development, but not with an unlimited, infinite
horizon as the moderns suppose; the horizon is bounded by the
eschatology. "For however easy it may be to read modern ideas into
the parables of the draught of fishes, the mustard seed and the leaven,
which, taken by themselves, seem to suggest the duration contemplated
by the modern view, it is nevertheless indubitable that Jesus, like Paul,
by no means looks forward to so protracted an earthly development;
on the contrary, nothing appears more clearly from the sources than
that He thought of its term as rapidly approaching, and of His victory
as nigh at hand; and looked to the last decisive events, even to the day
of judgment, as about to occur during the lifetime of the existing generation,
including Himself and His apostles." "It was the overmastering
pressure of circumstances which held Him prisoner within the limitations
of this obsolete belief." When His confidence in the development
Kingdom came into collision with barriers which He could not
pass, when His belief in the presence of the Kingdom of God grew dim,
the purely eschatological ideas won the upper hand, "and if we may
suppose that it was precisely this thought of the imminent decisive action
<P>
<center>214</center>
<P>
of God, taking possession of His mind with renewed force at this point
which steeled His human courage, and roused Him to a passion of self-sacrifice
with the hope of saving from the judgment whatever might
still be saved, we may welcome His adoption of these narrower ideas as
in accordance with the goodwill of God, which could only by this means
maintain the failing strength of its human instrument and secure the
spoils of the Divine warfare-the souls of men subdued and conquered
by Him."
<P>
The thought which had hovered before the mind of Renan, but which
in his hands had become only the motive of a romance-<i>une ficelle de
roman</i> as the French express it-was realised by Keim. Nothing deeper
or more beautiful has since been written about the development of
Jesus.
<P>
Less critical in character is Hase's "History of Jesus," [1] which superseded
in 1876 the various editions of the Handbook on the Life of Jesus
which had first appeared in 1829.
<P>
The question of the use of John's Gospel side by side with the Synoptics
he leaves in suspense, and speaks his last word on the subject in
the form of a parable. "If I may be allowed to use an avowedly parabolic
form of speech, the relation of Jesus to the two streams of Gospel tradition
may be illustrated as follows. Once there appeared upon earth
a heavenly Being. According to His first three biographers He goes about
more or less incognito, in the long garment of a Rabbi, a forceful popular
figure, somewhat Judaic in speech, only occasionally, almost unmarked
by His biographers, pointing with a smile beyond this brief
interlude to His home. In the description left by His favourite disciple,
He has thrown off the <i>talar</i> of the Rabbi, and stands before us in His
native character, but in bitter and angry strife with those who took
offence at His magnificent simplicity, and then later-it must be confessed,
more attractively-in deep emotion at parting with those whom,
during His pilgrimage on earth, He had made His friends, though they
did not rightly understand His strange, unearthly speech."
<P>
This is Hase's way, always to avoid a final decision. The fifty years
of critical study of the subject which he had witnessed and taken part
in had made him circumspect, sometimes almost sceptical. But his
notes of interrogation do not represent a covert supernaturahsni like
those in the Life of Jesus of 1829. Hase had been penetrated by the

influence of Strauss and had adopted from him the belief that the true
life of Jesus lies beyond the reach of criticism. "It is not my business,"
he says to his students in an introductory lecture, "to recoil in horror
from this or that thought, or to express it with embarrassment as being
dangerous; I would not forbid even the enthusiasm of doubt and detruction
which makes Strauss so strong and Renan so seductive."
<P>
It is left uncertain whether Jesus' consciousness of His Messiahship
reaches back to the days of His childhood, or whether it arose in the
ethical development of His ripening manhood. The concealment of His
Messianic claims is ascribed, as by Schenkel and others, to paedagogic
motives; it was necessary that Jesus should first educate the people
and the disciples up to a higher ethical view of His office. In the stress
which he lays upon the eschatology Hase has points of affinity with
Keim, for whom he had prepared the way in his Life of Jesus of 1829,
in which he had been the first to assert a development in Jesus in the
course of which He at first fully shared the Jewish eschatological views,
but later advanced to a more spiritual conception. In his Life of Jesus
of 1876 he is prepared to make the eschatology the dominant feature
in the last period also, and does not hesitate to represent Jesus as dying
in the enthusiastic expectation of returning upon the clouds of heaven.
He feels himself driven to this by the eschatological ideas in the last
discourses. "Jesus' clear and definite sayings," he declares, "with the
whole context of the circumstances in which they were spoken and
understood, have been forcing me to this conclusion for years past."
<P>
"That lofty Messianic dream must therefore continue to hold its
place, since Jesus, influenced as much by the idea of the Messianic
glories taken over from the beliefs of His people as by His own religious
exaltation, could not think of the victory of His Kingdom except as
closely connected with His own personal action. But that was only a
misunderstanding due to the unconscious poesy of a high-ranging
religious imagination, the ethical meaning of which could only be realised
by a long historical development. Christ certainly came again as
the greatest power on earth, and His power, along with His word, is
constantly judging the world. He faced the sufferings which lay immediately
before Him with His eyes fixed upon this great future."

Beyschlag was born in 1823 at Frankfort-on-Main, and went to Halle as Professor
in 1860. His splendid eloquence made him one of the chief spokesmen of German
Protestantism. As a teacher he exercised a remarkable and salutary influence,
although his scientific works are too much under the dominance of an apologetic

<P>
cusses the problems, so that the narrative is disencumbered of all
explanations, and by virtue of the author's admirable style becomes a
pure work of art, which rivets the interest of the reader and almost
causes the want of a consistent historical conception to be overlooked.
The fact is, however, that in regard to the two decisive questions Beyschlag
is deliberately inconsistent. Although he recognises that the
Gospel of John has not the character of an essentially historical source
"being, rather, a brilliant subjective portrait," "a didactic, quite as much
as an historical work," he produces his Life of Jesus by "combining
and mortising together Synoptic and Johannine elements." The same
uncertainty prevails in regard to the recognition of the definitely
eschatological character of Jesus' system of ideas. Beyschlag gives a
very large place to eschatology, so that in order to combine the spiritual
with the eschatological view his Jesus has to pass through three stages
of development. In the first He preaches the Kingdom as something
future, a supernatural event which was to be looked forward to, much
as the Baptist preached it. Then the response which was called forth
on all hands by His preaching led Him to believe that the Kingdom was
in some sense already present, "that the Father, while He delays the
outward manifestation of the Kingdom, is causing it to come even now
in quiet and unnoticed ways by a humble gradual growth, and the great
thought of His parables, which dominates the whole middle period of
His public life, the resemblance of the Kingdom to mustard seed or
leaven, comes to birth in His mind." As His failure becomes more and
more certain, "the centre of gravity of His thought is shifted to the
World beyond the grave, and the picture of a glorious return to conquer
and to judge the world rises before Him."
<P>
The peculiar interweaving of Synoptic and Johannine ideas leads to
the result that, between the two, Beyschlag in the end forms no clear
conception of the eschatology, and makes Jesus think in a half-Johannine,
half-Synoptic fashion. "It is a consequence of Jesus' profound
conception of the Kingdom of God as something essentially growing
that He regards its final perfection not as a state of rest, but rather as
a living movement, as a process of becoming, and since He regards
this process as a cosmic and supernatural process in which history finds
its consummation, and yet as arising entirely out of the ethical and
historical process, He combines elements from each into the same
prophetic conception." An eschatology of this kind is not matter for
history.
<P>
In the acceptance of the "miracles" Beyschlag goes to the utmost
limits allowed by criticism; in considering the possibility of one or
another of the recorded raisings from the dead he even finds himself
within the borders of rationalist territory.

Whether Bernhard Weiss's [1] is to be numbered with the liberal Lives
of Jesus is a question to which we may answer "Yes; but along with
the faults of these it has some others in addition." Weiss shares with
the authors of the liberal "Lives" the assumption that Mark designed to
set forth a definite "view of the course of development of the public
ministry of Jesus," and on the strength of that believes himself justified
in giving a very far-reaching significance to the details offered by
this Evangelist. The arbitrariness with which he carries out this theory
is quite as unbounded as Schenkel's, and in his fondness for the
"argument from silence" he even surpasses him. Although Mark never allows
a single word to escape him about the motives of the northern journeys,
Weiss is so clever at reading between the lines that the motives are
"quite sufficiently" clear to him. The object of these journeys was,
according to his explanation, "that the people might have an oppor-

tunity, undistracted by the immediate impression of His words and actions, to make up their minds in regard to the questions which they
had put to Him so pressingly and inescapably in the last days of His
public ministry; they must themselves draw their own conclusions alike
from the declarations and from the conduct of Jesus. Only by Jesus'
removing Himself for a time from their midst could they come to a
clear decision as to their attitude to Jesus." This modern psychologising
however, is closely combined with a dialectic which seeks to show that
there is no irreconcilable opposition between the belief in the Son of
God and Son of Man which the Church of Christ has always confessed
and a critical investigation of the question how far the details of His
life have been accurately preserved by tradition, and how they are to
be historically interpreted. That means that Weiss is going to cover up
the difficulties and stumbling-blocks with the mantle of Christian charity
which he has woven out of the most plausible of the traditional sophistries. As a dialectical performance on these lines his Life of Jesus
rivals in importance any except Schleierroacher's. On points of detail
there are many interesting historical observations. When all is said, one
can only regret that so much knowledge and so much ability have been
expended in the service of so hopeless a cause.
<P>
What was the net result of these liberal Lives of Jesus? In the first
place the clearing up of the relation between John and the Synoptics.
That seems surprising, since the chief representatives of this school,
Holtzmann, Schenkel, Weizsacker, and Hase, took up a mediating position
on this question, not to speak of Beyschlag and Weiss, for whom the
possibility of reconciliation between the two lines of tradition is an
accepted datum for ecclesiastical and apologetic reasons. But the very
attempt to hold the position made clear its inherent untenability. The
defence of the combination of the two traditions exhausted itself in the
efforts of these its critical champions, just as the acceptance of the
supernatural in history exhausted itself in the-to judge from the approval
of the many-victorious struggle against Strauss. In the course
of time Weizsacker, like Holtzmann, [1] advanced to the rejection of any

Hase and Schenkel accepted this position in principle, but were careful to keep
open a line of retreat.
<P>
Towards the end of the 'seventies the rejection of the Fourth Gospel as an historical
source was almost universally recognised in the critical camp. It is taken for
granted in the Life of Jesus by Karl Wittichen (Jena, 1876, 397 pp.), which might
be reckoned one of the most clearly conceived works of this kind based on the
Marcan hypothesis if its arrangement were not so bad. It is partly in the form of
a commentary, inasmuch as the presentment of the life takes the form of a
discussion of sixty-seven sections. The detail is very interesting. It makes an impression
of <i>naivete</i> when we find a series of sections grouped under the title, "The
establishment of <i>Christianity</i> in Galilee." No stress is laid on the significance of
Jesus' journey to the north. Wittichen, also, misled by Luke, asserts, just as Weisse
had done, that Jesus had worked in Judaea for some time prior to the triumphal entry.
<P>
<center>219</center>
<P>
possibility of reconciliation, and gave up the Fourth Gospel as an historical
source. The second demand of Strauss's first Life of Jesus was
now-at last-conceded by scientific criticism.
<P>
That does not mean, of course, that no further attempts at reconciliation
appeared thenceforward. Was ever a street so closed by a cordon
that one or two isolated individuals did not get through? And to dodge
through needs, after all, no special intelligence, or special courage.
Must we never speak of a victory so long as a single enemy remains
alive? Individual attempts to combine John with the Synoptics which
appeared after this decisive point are in some cases deserving of special
attention, as for example, Wendt's [1] acute study of the "Teaching of
Jesus," which has all the importance of a full treatment of the "Life."
But the very way in which Wendt grapples with his task shows that the
main issue is already decided. All he can do is to fight a skilful and determined
rearguard action. It is not the Fourth Gospel as it stands, but
only a "ground-document" on which it is based, which he, in common
with Weiss, Alexander Schweizer, and Renan, would have to be recognised
"alongside of the Gospel of Mark and the Logia of Matthew as an
historically trustworthy tradition regarding the teaching of Jesus," and
which may be used along with those two writings in forming a picture
of the Life of Jesus. For Wendt there is no longer any question of an
interweaving and working up together of the individual sections of
John and the Synoptists. He takes up much the same standpoint as
Holtzmann occupied in 1863, but he provides a much more comprehensive
and well-tested basis for it.
<P>
In the end there is no such very great difference between Wendt and
the writers who had advanced to the conviction of the irreconcilability
ot the two traditions. Wendt refuses to give up the Fourth Gospel altogether;
they, on their part, won only a half victory because they did
not as a matter of fact escape from the Johannine interpretation of the

<P>
Synoptics. By means of their psychological interpretation of the first
three Gospels they make for themselves an ideal Fourth Gospel, in the
interests of which they reject the existing Fourth Gospel. They will hear
nothing of the spiritualised Johannine Christ, and refuse to acknowledge
even to themselves that they have only deposed Him in order to
put in His place a spiritualised Synoptic Jesus Christ, that is, a man
who claimed to be the Messiah, but in a spiritual sense. All the development
which they discover in Jesus is in the last analysis only an evidence
of the tension between the Synoptics, in their natural literal sense
and the "Fourth Gospel" which is extracted from them by an artificial
interpretation.
<P>
The fact is, the separation between the Synoptics and the Fourth
Gospel is only the first step to a larger result which necessarily follows
from it-the complete recognition of the fundamentally eschatological
character of the teaching and influence of the Marcan and Matthaean
Jesus. Inasmuch as they suppressed this consequence, Holtzmann, Schenkel,
Hase, and Weizsacker, even after their critical conversion, still lay
under the spell of the Fourth Gospel, of a modern, ideal Fourth Gospel.
It is only when the eschatological question is decided that the problem
of the relation of John to the Synoptics is finally laid to rest. The liberal
Lives of Jesus grasped their incompatibility only from a literary point
of view, not in its full historical significance.
<P>
There is another result in the acceptance of which the critical school
had stopped half-way. If the Marcan plan be accepted, it follows that,
setting aside the references to the Son of Man in Mark ii. 10 and 28,
Jesus had never, previous to the incident at Caesarea Philippi, given
Himself out to be the Messiah or been recognised as such. The perception
of this fact marks one of the greatest advances in the study of the
subject. This result, once accepted, ought necessarily to have suggested
two questions: in the first place, why Jesus down to that moment had
made a secret of His Messiahship even to His disciples; in the second
place, whether at any time, and, if so, when and how, the people were
made acquainted with His Messianic claims. As a fact, however, by the
application of that ill-starred psychologising both questions were
smothered; that is to say, a sham answer was given to them. It was
regarded as self-evident that Jesus had concealed His Messiahship from
His disciples for so long in order in the meantime to bring them, without
their being aware of it, to a higher spiritual conception of the
Messiah; it was regarded as equally self-evident that in the last weeks
the Messianic claims of Jesus could no longer be hidden from the people,
but that He did not openly avow them, but merely allowed them to be
divined, in order to lead up the multitude to the recognition of the
higher spiritual character of the office which He claimed for Himself.
<P>
<center>221</center>
<P>
These ingenious psychologists never seemed to perceive that there is
not a word of all this in Mark; but that they had read it all into some
of the most contradictory and inexplicable facts in the Gospels, and had
thus created a Messiah who both wished to be Messiah and did not wish
it and who in the end, so far as the people were concerned, both was
and was not the Messiah. Thus these writers had only recognised the importance
of the scene at Caesarea Philippi, they had not ventured to
attack the general problem of Jesus' attitude in regard to the Messiahship,
and had not reflected further on the mutually contradictory facts
that Jesus purposed to be the Messiah and yet did not come forward
publicly in that character.
<P>
Thus they had side-tracked the study of the subject, and based all
their hopes of progress on an intensive exegesis of the detail of Mark.
They thought they had nothing to do but to occupy a conquered territory,
and never suspected that along the whole line they had only won
a half victory, never having thought out to the end either the eschatological
question or the fundamental historical question of the attitude
of Jesus to the Messiahship.
<P>
They were not disquieted by the obstinate persistence of the discussion
on the eschatological question. They thought it was merely a
skirmish with a few unorganised guerillas; in reality it was the advance-guard
of the army with which Reimarus was threatening their flank,
and which under the leadership of Johannes Weiss was to bring them
to so dangerous a pass. And while they were endeavouring to avoid this
turning movement they fell into the ambush which Bruno Bauer had
laid in their rear: Wrede held up the Marcan hypothesis and demanded
the pass-word for the theory of the Messianic consciousness and
claims of Jesus to which it was acting as convoy.
<P>
The eschatological and the literary school, finding themselves thus
opposed to a common enemy, naturally formed an alliance. The object
of their combined attack was not the Marcan outline of the life of Jesus,
which, in fact, they both accept, but the modern "psychological" method
of reading between the lines of the Marcan narrative. Under the cross fire
of these allies that idea of development which had been the strongest
entrenchment of the liberal critical Lives of Jesus, and which they had
been desperately endeavouring to strengthen down to the very last, was
finally blown to atoms.
<P>
But the striking thing about these liberal critical Lives of Jesus was
that they unconsciously prepared the way for a deeper historical view
which could not have been reached apart from them. A deeper understanding
of a subject is only brought to pass when a theory is carried
to its utmost limit and finally proves its own inadequacy.
<P>
There is this in common between rationalism and the liberal critical
<P>
<center>222</center>
<P>
method, that each had followed out a theory to its ultimate consequences.
The liberal critical school had carried to its limit the explanation of
the connexion of the actions of Jesus, and of the events of His life, by
a "natural" psychology; and the conclusions to which they had been
driven had prepared the way for the recognition that the natural psychology
is not here the historical psychology, but that the latter must
be deduced from certain historical data. Thus through the meritorious
and magnificently sincere work of the liberal critical school the a priori
"natural" psychology gave way to the eschatological. That is the net
result, from the historical point of view, of the study of the life of Jesus
in the post-Straussian period.
<P>
