<P>
<center><h2>DAVID FRIEDRICH STRAUSS - THE MAN AND HIS FATE</h2></center>
<P>
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND STRAUSS ONE MUST LOVE HIM. HE WAS NOT THE
greatest, and not the deepest, of theologians, but he was the most absolutely sincere. His insight and his errors were alike the insight and the
errors of a prophet. And he had a prophet's fate. Disappointment and
suffering gave his life its consecration. It unrolls itself before us like a
tragedy, in which, in the end, the gloom is lightened by the mild radiance
which shines forth from the nobility of the sufferer.
<P>
Strauss was born in 1808 at Ludwigsburg. His father was a merchant,
whose business, however, was unsuccessful, so that his means steadily
declined. The boy took his ability from his mother, a good, self-controlled, sensible, pious woman, to whom he raised a monument in his
"Memorial of a Good Mother" written in 1858, to be given to his
daughter on her confirmation-day.
<P>
From 1821 to 1825 he was a pupil at the "lower seminary" at Blaubeuren, along with Friedrich Vischer, Pfizer, Zimmermann, Marklin, and
Binder. Among their teachers was Ferdinand Christian Baur, whom they
were to meet with again at the university.
<P>
His first year at the university was uninteresting, as it was only in the
following year that the reorganisation of the theological faculty took
place, in consequence of the appointment of Baur. The instruction in
the philosophical faculty was almost equally unsatisfactory, so that the
friends would have gained little from the two years of philosophical
propaedeutic which formed part of the course prescribed for theological
students, if they had not combined to prosecute their philosophical
studies for themselves. The writings of Hegel began to exercise a power
ful influence upon them. For the philosophical faculty, Hegel's philosophy was as yet non-existent.
<P>
These student friends were much addicted to poetry. Two journeys
which Strauss made along with his fellow-student Binder to Weinsberg
to see Justinus Kerner made a deep impression upon him. He had to
<P>
<center>69</center>
<P>
make a deliberate effort to escape from the dream-world of the "Prophetess of Prevorst." Some years later, in a Latin note to Binder, he speaks
of Weinsberg as "Mecca nostra." [1]
<P>
According to Vischer's picture of him, the tall stripling made an impression of great charm, though he was rather shy except with intimates.
He attended lectures with pedantic regularity.
<P>
Baur was at that time still immersed in the prolegomena to his system; but Strauss already suspected the direction which the thoughts of
his young teacher were to take.
<P>
When Strauss and his student friends entered on their duties as clergymen, the others found great difficulty in bringing their theological views
into line with the popular beliefs which they were expected to preach.
Strauss alone remained free from inner struggles. In a letter to Binder [2]
of the year 1831, he explains that in his sermons — he was then assistant
at Klein-Ingersheim near Ludwigsburg — he did not use "representative
notions" (Vorstellungen, used as a philosophical technicality) such as
that of the Devil, which the people were already prepared to dispense
with; but others which still appeared to be indispensable, such as those
of an eschatological character, he merely endeavoured to present in
such a way that the "intellectual concept" (Begriff) which lay behind,
might so far as possible shine through. "When I considered," he continues, "how far even in intellectual preaching the expression is inadequate to the true essence of the concept, it does not seem to me to matter
much if one goes even a step further. I at least go about the matter without the least scruple, and cannot ascribe this to a mere want of sincerity in myself."
<P>
That is Hegelian logic.
<P>
After being for a short time Deputy-professor at Maulbronn, he took
his doctor's degree with a dissertation on the <font face="Symbol">apokatastasiV pantwn</font> (restoration of all things. Acts iii. 21). This work is lost. From his letters it
appears that he treated the subject chiefly from the religious-historical
point of view. [3]
<P>
When Binder took his doctorate with a philosophical thesis on the immortality of the soul, Strauss, in 1832, wrote to him expressing the opin-
<P>
[1] See Theobald Ziegler, "Zur Biographie von David Friedrich Strauss." (Materials
for the Biography of D. F. S.), in the <i>Deutsche Revue</i>, May, June, July 1905. The
hitherto unpublished letters to Binder throw some light on the development of
Strauss during the formative years before the publication of the Life of Jesus.
<P>
Binder, later Director of the Board of Studies at Stuttgart, was the friend who
delivered the funeral allocution at the grave of Strauss. This last act of friendship
exposed him to enmity and calumny of all kinds. For the text of his short address,
see the <i>Deutsche Revue</i>, 1905, p. 107.

<P>
ion that the belief in personal immortality could not properly be regarded as a consequence of the Hegelian system, since, according to
Hegel, it was not the subjective spirit of the individual person, but only
the objective Spirit, the self-realising Idea which constantly embodies
itself in new creations, to which immortality belongs. [1]
<P>
In October 1831 he went to Berlin to hear Hegel and Schleiermacher.
On the 14th of November Hegel, whom he had visited shortly before,
was carried off by cholera. Strauss heard the news in Schleiermacher's
house, from Schleiermacher himself, and is said to have exclaimed, with
a certain want of tact, considering who his informant was: "And it was
to hear him that I came to Berlin!"
<P>
There was no satisfactory basis for a relationship between Schleiermacher and Strauss. They had nothing in common. That did not prevent Strauss's Life of Jesus being sometimes described by opponents of
Schleiermacher as a product of the latter's philosophy of religion. Indeed, as late as the 'sixties, Tholuck thought it necessary to defend the
memory of the great theologian against this reproach.
<P>
As a matter of fact, the plan of the Life of Jesus arose during Strauss's
intercourse with Vatke, to whom he felt himself strongly drawn. Moreover, what was first sketched out was not primarily the plan of a Life of
Jesus, but that of a history of the ideas of primitive Christianity, intended to serve as a standard by which to judge ecclesiastical dogma.
The Life of Jesus was originally designed, it might almost be said, as a
mere prologue to this work, the plan of which was subsequently carried
out under the title, "Christian Theology in its Historical Development
and in its Antagonism with Modern Scientific Knowledge" (published
in 1840-1841).
<P>
When in the spring of 1832 he returned to Tubingen to take up the
position of "Repetent" [2] in the theological college (Stift), these plans
were laid on the shelf in consequence of his preoccupation with philosophy, and if things had gone according to Strauss's wishes, they would
perhaps never have come to fulfilment. The "Repetents" had the right
to lecture upon philosophy. Strauss felt himself called upon to come forward as an apostle of Hegel, and lectured upon Hegel's logic with
tremendous success. Zeiler, who attended these lectures, records the unforgettable impression which they made on him. Besides championing
Hegel, Strauss also lectured upon Plato, and upon the hiiitory of modern
philosophy. These were three happy semesters.
<P>
"In my theology," he writes in a letter of 1833, [3] "philosophy occupies
such a predominant position that my theological views can only be

<P>
worked out to completeness by means of a more thorough study of phi-
losophy, and this course of study I am now going to prosecute uninter-
ruptedly and without concerning myself whether it leads me back to
theology or not." Further on he says: "If I know myself rightly, my
position in regard to theology is that what interests me in theology causes
offence, and what does not cause offence is indifferent to me. For this
reason I have refrained from delivering lectures on theology."
<P>
The philosophical faculty was not altogether pleased at the success
of the apostle of Hegel, and wished to have the right of the "Repetents"
to lecture on philosophy curtailed. The latter, however, took their stand
upon the tradition. Straus was desired to intermit his lectures until the
matter should be settled. He would have liked best to end the situation
by entering the philosophical faculty. The other "Repetents," however,
begged him not to do so, but to continue to champion their rights. It is
possible also that obstacles were placed in the way of his plan by the
philosophical faculty. However that may be, it was in any case not
carried through. Strauss was forced back upon theology.
<P>
According to Hase, [1] Strauss began his studies for the Life of Jesus
by writing a detailed critical review of his (Hase's) text-book. He sent
this to Berlin to the Jahrbucher fur wissenschaftliche Kritik, which, however, refused it. His resolve to publish first, instead of the general work
on the genesis of Christian doctrine, a critical study on the life of Jesus
was doubtless determined by Schleiermacher's lectures on this subject.
When in Berlin he had procured a copy of a lecture note-book, and the
reading of it incited him to opposition.
<P>
Considering its character, the work was rapidly produced. He wrote it
sitting at the window of the Repetents' room, which looks out upon the
gateway-arch. When its two volumes appeared in 1835 the name of the
author was wholly unknown, except for some critical studies upon the
Gospels. This book, into which he had poured his youthful enthusiasm,
rendered him famous in a moment—and utterly destroyed his prospects.
Among his opponents the most prominent was Steudel, a member of the
theological faculty, who, as president of the Stift, made representations
against him to the Ministry, and succeeded in securing his removal from
the post of "Repetent." The hopes which Strauss had placed upon his
friends were disappointed. Only two or three at most dared to publish
anything in his defence.
<P>
He first accepted a transfer to the post of Deputy-professor at Ludwigsburg, but in less than a year he was glad to give it up, and he then
returned to Stuttgart. There he lived for several years, busying himself
<P>

Life of Jesus.
<P>
<center>72</center>
<P>
lit the preparation of new editions of the Life of Jesus, and in writing
answers to the attacks which were made upon him.
<P>
Towards the end of the 'thirties he became conscious of a growing impulse towards more positive views. The criticisms of his opponents had
made some impression upon him. The second volume of polemics was laid
aside. In its place appeared the third edition of the Life of Jesus, 1838-1839, containing a series of amazing concessions. Strauss explains that
in consequence of reading De Wette's commentary and Neander's Life
of Jesus he had begun to feel some hesitation about his former doubts
regarding the genuineness and credibility of the Fourth Gospel. The
historic personality of Jesus again began to take on intelligible outlines
for him. These inconsistencies he removed in the next edition, acknowledging that he did not know how he could so have temporarily vacillated
in his point of view. The matter admits, however, of a psychological
explanation. He longed for peace, for he had suffered more than his
enemies suspected or his friends knew. The ban of the outlaw lay heavy
upon his soul. In this spirit he composed in 1839 the monologues entitled
<i>Vergangliches und Bleibendes im Christentum</i> ("Transient and Perma-
nent Elements in Christianity"), which appeared again in the following
year under the title <i>Friedliche Blatter</i> ("Leaves of Peace").
<P>
For a moment it seemed as though his rehabilitation would be accomplished. In January 1839 the noble-minded Hitzig succeeded in getting
him appointed to the vacant chair of dogmatics in Zurich. But the orthodox and pietist parties protested so vehemently that the Government was
obliged to revoke the appointment. Strauss was pensioned off, without
ever entering on his office.
<P>
About that time his mother died. In 1841 he lost his father. When the
estate came to be settled up, it was found that his affairs were in a less
unsatisfactory condition than had been feared. Strauss was secure
against want. The success of his second great work, his "Christian Theology" (published in 1840-41), compensated him for his disappointment
at Zurich. In conception it is perhaps even greater than the Life of
Jesus; and in depth of thought it is to be classed with the most im-
portant contributions to theology. In spite of that it never attracted so
much attention as the earlier work. Strauss continued to be known as the
author of the Life of Jesus. Any further ground of offence which he
might give was regarded as quite subsidiary.
<P>
And the book contains matter for offence in no common degree. The
point to which Strauss applies his criticism is the way in which the
Christian theology which grew out of the ideas of the ancient world has
been brought into harmony with the Christianity of rationalism and of
speculative philosophy. Either, to use his own expression, both are so
finely pulverised in the process—as in the case of Schleiermacher's corn-
<P>
<center>73</center>
<P>
bination of Spinozism with Christianity—that it needs a sharp eye to
rediscover the elements of the mixture; or the two are shaken together
like water and oil, in which case the semblance of combination is only
maintained so long as the shaking continues. For this crude procedure
he desires to substitute a better method, based upon a preliminary historical criticism of dogma, in order that thought may no longer have to
deal with the present form of Church theology, but with the ideas which
worked as living forces in its formation.
<P>
This is brilliantly worked out in detail. The result is not a positive, but
a negative Hegelian theology. Religion is not concerned with supra-mundane beings and a divinely glorious future, but with present spiritual
realities which appear as "moments" in the eternal being and becoming
of Absolute Spirit. At the end of the second volume, where battle is
joined on the issue of personal immortality, all these ideas play their part
in the struggle. Personal immortality is finally rejected in every form,
for the critical reasons which Strauss had already set forth in the letters
of 1832. Immortality is not something which stretches out into the future,
but simply and solely the present quality of the spirit, its inner universality, its power of rising above everything finite to the Idea. Here the
thought of Hegel coincides with that of Schleiermacher. "The saying of
Schleiermacher, 'In the midst of finitude to be one with the Infinite, and
to be eternal in a moment,' is all that modern thought can say about
immortality." But neither Schleiermacher nor Hegel was willing to draw
the natural inferences from their ultimate position, or at least they did
not give them any prominence.
<P>
It is not the application of the mythological explanation to the Gospel
history which irrevocably divides Strauss from the theologians, but the
question of personal immortality. It would be well for them if they
had only to deal with the Strauss of the Life of Jesus, and not with the
thinker who posed this question with inexorable trenchancy. They might
then face the future more calmly, relieved of the anxiety lest once more
Hegel and Schleiermacher might rise up in some pious but critical spirit,
not to speak smooth things, but to ask the ultimate questions, and might
force theology to fight its battle with Strauss all over again.
<P>
At the very time when Strauss was beginning to breathe freely once
more, had turned his back upon all attempts at compromise, and reconciled himself to giving up teaching; and when, after settling his father's
affairs, he had the certainty of being secure against penury; at that very
time he sowed for himself the seeds of a new, immitigable suffering by
his marriage with Agnese Schebest, the famous singer.
<P>
They were not made for one another. He could not look to her for any
sympathy with his plans, and she on her part was repelled by the
pedantry of his disposition. Housekeeping difficulties and the trials of
<P>
<center>74</center>
<P>
a limited income added another element of discord. They removed to
Sontheim near Heilbronn with the idea of learning to adapt themselves
to one another far from the distractions of the town; but that did not
better matters. They lived apart for a time, and after some years they
procured a divorce, custody of the children being assigned to the father.
The lady took up her residence in Stuttgart, and Strauss paid her an
allowance up to her death in 1870.
<P>
What he suffered may be read between the lines in the passage in "The
Old Faith and the New" where he speaks of the sacredness of marriage
and the admissibility of divorce. The wound bled inwardly. His mental
powers were disabled. At this time he wrote little. Only in the apologue
"Julian the Apostate, or the Romanticist on the throne of the Caesars"—that brilliant satire upon Frederic William IV., written in 1847—is there
a flash of the old spirit.
<P>
But in spite of his antipathy to the romantic disposition of the King
of Prussia he entered the lists in 1848 on behalf of the efforts of the
smaller German states to form a united Germany, apart from Austria,
under the hegemony of Prussia. He did not suffer his political acumen
to be blunted either by personal antipathies or by particularism. The
citizens of Ludwigsburg wished to have him as their representative in
the Frankfort parliament, but the rural population, who were pietistic in
sympathies, defeated his candidature. Instead, his native town sent him
to the Wiirtemberg Chamber of Deputies. But here his philistinism
came to the fore again. The phrase-mongering revolutionary party in
the chamber disgusted him. He saw himself more and more forced to
the "rights," and was obliged to act politically with men whose reactionary sympathies he was far from sharing. His constituents, meanwhile,
were thoroughly discontented with his attitude. In the end the position
became intolerable. It was also painful to him to have to reside in Stuttgart, where he could not avoid meeting the woman who had brought so
much misery into his life. Further—he himself mentions this point in his
memoirs—he had no practice in speaking without manuscript, and cut
a poor figure as a debater. Then came the "Blum Case." Robert Blum,
a revolutionary, had been shot by court martial in Vienna. The Wiirtemberg Chamber desired to vote a public celebration of his funeral. Strauss
did not think there was any ground for making a hero of this agitator,
merely because he had been shot, and was not inclined to blame the
Austrian Government very severely for meting out summary justice to a
disturber of the peace. His attitude brought on him a vote of censure
from his constituents. When, subsequently, the President of the Chamber
called him to order for asserting that a previous speaker had "concealed
by sleight of hand" (wegeskamotiert, "juggled away") an important
point in the debate, he refused to accept the vote of censure, resigned his
<P>
<center>75</center>
<P>
membership, and ceased to attend the diets. As he himself put it, he
"jumped out of the boat." Then began a period of restless wandering,
during which he beguiled his time with literary work. He wrote, inter
alia, upon Lessing, Hutten, and Reimarus, rediscovering the last-named
for his fellow-countrymen.
<P>
At the end of the 'sixties he returned once more to theology. His "Life
of Jesus adapted for the German People" appeared in 1864. In the
preface he refers to Renan, and freely acknowledges the great merits
of his work.
<P>
The Prusso-Austrian war placed him in a difficult position. His historical insight made it impossible for him to share the particularism of
his friends; on the contrary, he recognised that the way was now being
prepared for the realisation of his dream of 1848—an alliance of the
smaller German States under the hegemony of Prussia. As he made no
secret of his opinions, he had the bitter experience of receiving the cold
shoulder from men who had hitherto loyally stood by him.
<P>
In the year 1870 it was granted to him to become the spokesman of
the German people; through a publication on Voltaire which had appeared not long before he had become acquainted with Renap In a
letter to Strauss, written after the first battles, Renan mad" a passing
allusion to these great events. Strauss seized the opportunity to explain
to him, in a vigorous "open letter" of the 12th of August, Germany's
reason and justification for going to war. Receiving an answer from
Renan, he then, in a second letter, of the 29th of September, took occasion to defend Germany's right to demand the cession of Alsace, not on
the ground of its having formerly been German territory, but for the
defence of her natural frontiers. The resounding echo evoked by these
words, inspired, as they were, by the enthusiasm of the moment, compensated him for much of the obloquy which he had had to bear.
<P>
His last work, "The Old Faith and the New," appeared in 1872. Once
more, as in the work on theology published in 1840-1841, he puts to
himself the question. What is there of permanence in this artificial compound of theology and philosophy, faith and thought? But he puts the
question with a certain bitterness, and shows himself too much under
the influence of Darwinism, by which his mind was at that time dominated. The Hegelian system of thought, which served as a firm basis for
the work of 1840, has fallen in ruins. Strauss is alone with his own
thoughts, endeavouring to raise himself above the new scientific worldview. His powers of thought, never, for all his critical acumen, strong
on the creative side, and now impaired by age, were unequal to the task.
There is no force and no greatness in the book.
<P>
To the question, "Are we still Christians?" he answers, "No." But to
his second question, "Have we still a religion?" he is prepared to give
<P>
<center>76</center>
<P>
an affirmative answer, if the assumption is granted that the feeling of
dependence, of self-surrender, of inner freedom, which has sprung from
the pantheistic world-view, can be called religion. But instead of developing the idea of this deep inner freedom, and presenting religion in the
form in which he had experienced it, he believes himself obliged to offer
some new construction based upon Darwinism, and sets himself to
answer the two questions, "How are we to understand the world?" and
"How are we to regulate our lives?"—the form of the latter is somewhat lacking in distinction—in a quite impersonal way. It is only the
schoolmaster and pedant in him—who was always at the elbow of the
thinker even in his greatest works—that finds expression here.
<P>
It was a dead book, in spite of the many editions which it went
through, and the battle which raged over it was, like the fiercest of the
Homeric battles, a combat over the dead.
<P>
The theologians declared Strauss bankrupt, and felt themselves rich
because they had made sure of not being ruined by a similar unimaginative honesty. Friedrich Nietzsche, from the height of his would-be Schopenhauerian pessimism, mocked at the fallen hero.
<P>
Before the year was out Strauss began to suffer from an internal ulcer.
For many months he bore his sufferings with quiet resignation and
inner serenity, until on the 8th of February 1874, in his native town of
Ludwigsburg, death set him free.
<P>
A few weeks earlier, on the 29th of December 1873, his sufferings and
his thoughts received illuminating expression in the following poignant
verses:—
<P>
<blockquote>
Wem ich dieses klage,<BR>
Weiss, ich klage nicht;<BR>
Der ich dieses sage,<BR>
Fiihit, ich zage nicht.<BR>
<P>
Heute heisst's verglimmen,<BR>
Wie ein Licht verglimmt,<BR>
In die Luft verschwimmen,<BR>
Wie ein Ton verschwimmt.<BR>
<P>
Moge schwach wie immer,<BR>
Aber hell und rein,<BR>
Dieser letzte Schimmer<BR>
Dieser Ton nur sein.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
He was buried on a stormy February day.
<P>
<blockquote>
He to whom my plaint is<BR>
Knows I shed no tear;<BR>
She to whom I say this<BR>
Feels I have no fear.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
<center>77</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
Time has come for fading,<BR>
Like a glimmering ray,<BR>
Or a sense-evading<BR>
Strain that floats away.<BR>
<P>
May, though fainter, dimmer,<BR>
Only, clear and pure,<BR>
To the last the glimmer<BR>
And the strain endure.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
The persons alluded to in the first verse are his son, who, as a physician, attended
him in his illness, and to whom he was deeply attached, and a very old friend to
whom the verses were addressed.—TRANSLATOR.
