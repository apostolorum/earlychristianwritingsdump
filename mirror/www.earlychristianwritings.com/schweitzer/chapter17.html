ONLY SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF DALMAN'S GRAMMAR OF JEWISH PALESTINIAN Aramaic in 1894 have we really known what was the dialect in
which the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount were spoken. This
work closes a discussion which had been proceeding for centuries on a
line parallel to that of theology proper, and which, according to the
<P>
<center>271</center>
<P>
clear description of Arnold Meyer, ran its course somewhat as follows. [1]
<P>
The question regarding the language spoken by Jesus had been
rigorously discussed in the sixteenth century. Up till that time no one
had known what to make of the tradition recorded by Eusebius that the
speech of the apostles had been "Syrian" since the distinction between
Syrian Hebrew, and "Chaldee" was not understood and all three designations were used indiscriminately. Light was first thrown upon ths
question by Joseph Justus Scaliger (l609). In the year 1555, Job.
Alb. Widmanstadt, Chancellor of Ferdinand I., had published the Syriac
translation of the Bible in fulfilment of the wishes of an old scholar of
Bologna, Theseus Ambrosius, who had left him the manuscript as a
sacred legacy. He himself and his contemporaries believed that in this
they had the Gospel in the mother-tongue of Jesus, until Scaliger, in one
of his letters, gave a clear sketch of the Syrian dialects, distinguished
Syriac from Chaldee, and further drew a distinction between the Babylonian
Chaldee and Jewish Chaldee of the Targums, and in the language
of the Targums itself distinguished an earlier from a later stratum. The
apostles spoke, according to Scaliger, a Galilaean dialect of Chaldaic, or
according to the more correct nomenclature introduced later, following
a suggestion of Scaliger's, a dialect of Aramaic, and, in addition to that,
the Syriac of Antioch. Next, Hugo Grotius put in a strong plea for a
distinction between Jewish and Antiochian Syriac. Into the confusion
caused at that time by the use of the term "Hebrew" some order was
introduced by the Leyden Calvinistic professor Claude Saumaise, who,
writing in French, emphasised the point that the New Testament, and
the Early Fathers, when they speak of Hebrew, mean Syriac, since
Hebrew had become completely unknown to the Jews of that period.
Brian Walton, the editor of the London polyglot, which was completed
in 1657, supposed that the dialect of Onkelos and Jonathan was the
language of Jesus, being under the impression that both these Targums
were written in the time of Jesus.
<P>
The growing knowledge of the distinction between Hebrew and
Aramaic did not prevent the Vienna Jesuit Inchofer (l648) from maintaining
that Jesus spoke-Latin! The Lord cannot have used any other
language upon earth, since this is the language of the saints in heaven.
On the Protestant side, Vossius, opposing Richard Simon, endeavoured
to establish the thesis that Greek was the language of Jesus, being partly
inspired by the apologetic purpose of preventing the authenticity of the
discourses and sayings of Jesus from being weakened by supposing them
to have been translated from Aramaic into Greek, but also rightly
recognising the importance which the Greek language must have assumed
<P>

at that time in northern Palestine, through which there passed such
important trade routes.
<P>
This view was brought up again by the Neapolitan legal scholar
Dominicus Diodati, in his book <i>De Christo Craece loquente</i>, 1767, who
added some interesting material concerning the importance of the Greek
language at the period and in the native district of Jesus. But five years
later, in 1772, this view was thoroughly refuted by Giambernardo de
Rossi, [1] who argued convincingly that among a people so separate and
so conservative as the Jews the native language cannot possibly have
been wholly driven out. The apostles wrote Greek for the sake of foreign
readers. In the year 1792, Johann Adrian Bolten, "first collegiate pastor
at the principal church in Altona" (l807), made the first attempt to
re-translate the sayings of Jesus into the original tongue. [2]
<P>
The certainly original Greek of the Epistles and the Johannine literature
was a strong argument against the attempt to recognise no language
save Aramaic as known to Jesus and His disciples. Paulus the rationalist,
therefore, sought a middle path, and explained that while the Aramaic
dialect was indeed the native language of Jesus, Greek had become so
generally current among the population of Galilee, and still more of
Jerusalem, that the founders of Christianity could use this language
when they found it needful to do so. His Catholic contemporary. Hug,
came to a similar conclusion.
<P>
In the course of the nineteenth century Aramaic-known down to
the time of Michaelis as "Chaldee" [3]-was more thoroughly studied.
The various branches of this language and the history of its progress
became more or less clearly recognisable. Kautzsch's grammar of Biblical Aramaic [4] (1884) and Dalman's [5] work embody the result of these

performance.                                                                ,
<P>
[3] The name Chaldee was due to the mistaken belief that the language in which
parts of Daniel and Ezra were written was really the vernacular of Babylonia. [1] That
vernacular, now known to us from cuneiform tablets and inscriptions, is a Semitic
language, but quite different from Aramaic.-F. C. B.
<P>
[4] Emil Friedrich Kautzsch was born in 1841 at Plauen in Saxony, and studied in
Leipzig, where he became Privat-Docent in 1869. In 1872 he was called as as Professor to Basle, in 1880 to Tubingen, in 1888 to Halle.

<P>
studies. "The Aramaic language," explains Meyer, "is a branch of the
North Semitic, the linguistic stock to which also belong the Assyrio-Babylonian
language in the East, and the Canaanitish languages, including Hebrew,
in the West, while the South Semitic languages-the
Arabic and Aethiopic-form a group by themselves. The users of these
languages, the Aramaeans, were seated in historic times between the
Babylonians and Canaanites, the area of their distribution extending
from the foot of Lebanon and Hermon in a north-easterly direction as
far as Mesopotamia, where "Aram of the two rivers" forms their eastern-most
province. Their immigration into these regions forms the third
epoch of the Semitic migrations, which probably lasted from 1600 B.C.
down to 600.
<P>
The Aramaic states had no great stability. The most important of
them was the kingdom of Damascus, which at a certain period was so
dangerous an enemy to northern Israel. In the end, however, the Aramaean dynasties were crushed, like the two Israelitish kingdoms, between
the upper and nether millstones of Babylon and Egypt. In the time of
the successors of Alexander, there arose in these regions the Syrian
kingdom; which in turn gave place to the Roman power.
<P>
But linguistically the Aramaeans conquered the whole of Western Asia.
In the course of the first millennium B.C. Aramaic became the language
of commerce and diplomacy, as Babylonian had been during the second.
It was only the rise of Greek as a universal language which put a term
to these conquests of the Aramaic.
<P>
In the year 701 B.C. Aramaic had not yet penetrated to Judaea. When
the <i>rabshakeh</i> (officer) sent by Sennacherib addressed the envoys of
Hezekiah in Hebrew, they begged him to speak Aramaic in order that
the men upon the wall might not understand. [1] For the post-exilic period
the Aramaic edicts in the Book of Ezra and inscriptions on Persian coins
show that throughout wide districts of the new empire Aramaic had
made good its position as the language of common intercourse. Its
domain extended from the Euxine southwards as far as Egypt, and
even into Egypt itself. Samaria and the Hauran adopted it. Only the
Greek towns and Phoenicia resisted.
<P>
The influence of Aramaic upon Jewish literature begins to be noticeable
about the year 600. Jeremiah and Ezekiel, writing in a foreign land
in an Aramaic environment, are the first witnesses to its supremacy. In
the northern part of the country, owing to the immigration of foreign
colonists after the destruction of the northern kingdom, it had already
gained a hold upon the common people. In the Book of Daniel, written
<P>
[1] 2 Kings xviii. 26 ff.
<P>
<center>274</center>
<P>
in the year 167 B.C., the Hebrew and Aramaic languages alternate. Perhaps, indeed, we ought to assume an Aramaic ground-document as the
basis of this work.
<P>
At what time Aramaic became the common popular speech in the
post-exilic community we cannot exactly discover. Under Nehemiah
"Judaean," that is to say, Hebrew, was still spoken in Jerusalem; in the
time of the Maccabees Aramaic seems to have wholly driven out the
ancient national language. Evidence for this is to be found in the occurrence
of Aramaic passages in the Talmud, from which it is evident
that the Rabbis used this language in the religious instruction of the
people. The provision that the text, after being read in Hebrew, should
be interpreted to the people, may quite well reach back into the time
of Jesus. The first evidence for the practice is in the Mishna, about
A.D. 150.
<P>
In the time of Jesus three languages met in Galilee-Hebrew, Aramaic,
and Greek. In what relation they stood to each other we do not know,
since Josephus, the only writer who could have told us, fails us in this
point, as he so often does elsewhere. He informs us that when acting as
an envoy of Titus he spoke to the people of Jerusalem in the ancestral
language, and the word he uses is <font face="Symbol">ebraizwn</font>. But the very thing we
should like to know-whether, namely, this language was Aramaic or
Hebrew, he does not tell us. We are left in the same uncertainty by the
passage in Acts (xxii. 2) which says that Paul spoke to the people
<font face="Symbol">'Ebraidi dialektw</font>, thereby gaining their attention, for there is no indication whether the language was Aramaic or Hebrew. For the writers
of that period "Hebrew" simply means Jewish.
<P>
We cannot, therefore, be sure in what relation the ancient Hebrew
sacred language and the Aramaic of ordinary intercourse stood to one
another as regards religious writings and religious instruction. Did the
ordinary man merely learn by heart a few verses, prayers, and psalms?
Or was Hebrew, as the language of the cultus, also current in wider
circles?
<P>
Dalman gives a number of examples of works written in Hebrew in
the century which witnessed the birth of Christ: "A Hebrew original,
he says, "must be assumed in the case of the main part of the Aethiopic
book of Enoch, the Assumption of Moses, the Apocalypse of Baruch,
Fourth Ezra, the Book of Jubilees, and for the Jewish ground-document
of the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, of which M. Gaster has discovered
a Hebrew manuscript." The first Rook of Maccabees, too, seems
to him to go back to a Hebrew original. Nevertheless, he holds it to
impossible that synagogue discourses intended for the people can have
been delivered in Hebrew, or that Jesus taught otherwise than in
Aramaic.
<P>
<center>275</center>
<P>
Franz Delitzsch's view, on the other hand, is that Jesus and the disciples
taught in Hebrew; and that is the opinion of Resch also. Adolf
Neubauer, [1] Reader in Rabbinical Hebrew at Oxford, attempted a compromise.
It was certainly the case, he thought, that in the time of Jesus
Aramaic was spoken throughout Palestine; but whereas in Galilee this
language had an exclusive dominance, and the knowledge of Hebrew
was confined to texts learned by heart, in Jerusalem Hebrew had
renewed itself by the adoption of Aramaic elements, and a kind of Neo-Hebraic language had arisen. This solution at least testifies to the
difficulty of the question. The fact is that from the language of the New
Testament it is often difficult to make out whether the underlying words
are Hebrew or Aramaic. Thus, for instance, Dalman remarks-with
reference to the question whether the statement of Papias refers to a
Hebrew or an Aramaic "primitive Matthew"-that it is difficult "to
produce proof of an Aramaic as distinct from a Hebrew source, because
it is often the case in Biblical Hebrew, and still more often in the idiom
of the Mishna, that the same expressions and forms of phrase are possible as in Aramaic." Delitzsch's [2] "retranslation" of the New Testament
into Hebrew is therefore historically justified.
<P>
But the question about the language of Jesus must not be confused
with the problem of the original language of the primitive form of Matthew's Gospel.
In reference to the latter, Dalman thinks that the tradition
of the Early Church regarding an earlier Aramaic form of
the Gospel must be considered as lacking confirmation. "It is only
in the case of Jesus' own words that an Aramaic original form is undeniable,
and it is only for these that Early Church tradition asserted
the existence of a Semitic documentary source. It is, therefore, the right
and duty of Biblical scholarship to investigate the form which the sayings
of Jesus must have taken in the original and the sense which in
this form they must have conveyed to Jewish hearers."
<P>
That Jesus spoke Aramaic, Meyer has shown by collecting all the
Aramaic expressions which occur in His preaching. [3] He considers the

Hebraische ubersetzt</i>. 1877. (The Books of the N.T. translated from Greek into
Hebrew.) This work has been circulated by thousands among Jews throughout the
whole world.
<P>
Delitzsch was born in 1813 at Leipzig and became Privat-Docent there in 1842,
went to Rostock as Professor in 1846, to Erlangen in 1850, and returned in 1867 to
Leipzig. By conviction he was a strict Lutheran in theology. He was one of the
leading experts in Late-Jewish and Talmudic literature. He died in 1890.

<P>
"Abba" in Gethsemane decisive, for this means that Jesus prayed in
Aramaic in His hour of bitterest need. Again the cry from the cross
was, according to Mark xv. 34, also Aramaic: <font face="Symbol">'Elwi, elwi, lama sabacqanei</font>.
The Old Testament was therefore most familiar to Him in
an Aramaic translation, otherwise this form of the Psalm passage would
not have come to His lips at the moment of death.
<P>
It is a quite independent question whether Jesus could speak, or at
least understand, Greek. According to Josephus the knowledge of Greek
in Palestine at that time, even among educated Jews, can only have been
of a quite elementary character. He himself had to learn it laboriously
in order to be able to write in it. His "Jewish War" was first written in
Aramaic for his fellow-countrymen; the Greek edition was, by his own
avowal, not intended for them. In another passage, it is true, he seems
to imply a knowledge of, and interest in, foreign languages even among
people in humble life. [1]
<P>
An analogy, which is in many respects very close, to the linguistic
conditions in Palestine was offered by Alsace under French rule in the
'sixties of the nineteenth century. Here, too, three languages met in the
same district. The High-German of Luther's translation of the Bible
was the language of the Church, the Alemannic dialect was the usual
speech of the people, while French was the language of culture and of
government administration. This remarkable analogy would be rather in
favour-if analogy can be admitted to have any weight in the question-of
Delitzsch and Resch, since the Biblical High-German, although
never spoken in social intercourse, strongly influenced the Alemannic
dialect-although this was, on the other hand, quite uninfluenced by
Modern High-German-but did not allow it to penetrate into Church or
school, there maintaining for itself an undivided sway. French made
some progress, but only in certain circles, and remained entirely excluded
from the religious sphere. The Alsatians of the poorer classes
who could at that time have repeated the Lord's Prayer or the Beatitudes
in French would not have been difficult to count. The Lutheran translation
still holds its own to some extent against the French translation
with the older generation of the Alsatian community in Paris, which has
in other respects become completely French-so strong is the influence
of a former ecclesiastical language even among those who have left
their native home. There is one factor, however, which is not represented
in the analogy; the influence of the Greek-speaking Jews of the
Diaspora, who gathered to the Feasts at Jerusalem, upon the extension
of the Greek language in the mother-country.
<P>
Jesus, then, spoke Galilaean Aramaic, which is known to us as
<P>
[1] See Meyer, p. 61 ff.
<P>
<center>277</center>
<P>
a separate dialect from writings of the fourth to the seventh century.
For the Judaean dialect we have more and earlier evidence. We have
literary monuments in it from the first to the third century. "It is very
probable," Dalman thinks, "that the popular dialect of Northern Palestine,
after the final fall of the Judaean centre of the Aramaic-Jewish
culture which followed on the Bar-Cochba rising, spread over almost
the whole of Palestine."
<P>
The retranslations into Aramaic are therefore justified. After J. A.
Bolten's attempt had remained for nearly a hundred years the only
one of its kind, the experiment has been renewed in our own time by
J. T. Marshall, E. Nestle, J. Wellhausen, Arnold Meyer, and Gustaf
Dalman; in the case of Marshall and Nestle with the subsidiary purpose
of endeavouring to prove the existence of an Aramaic documentary
source. These retranslations first attracted their due meed of attention
from theologians in connexion with the Son-of-Man question. Rarely,
if ever, have theologians experienced such a surprise as was sprung upon
them by Hans Lietzmann's essay in 1896. [1] Jesus had never, so ran the
thesis of the Bonn candidate in theology, applied to Himself the title
Son of Man, because in the Aramaic the title did not exist, and on
linguistic grounds could not have existed. In the language which He
used, [Son of Man in Aramaic] was merely a periphrasis for "a man." That Jesus meant
Himself when He spoke of the Son of Man, none of His hearers could
have suspected.
<P>
Lietzmann had not been without predecessors. [2] Gilbert Genebrard,
who died Archbishop of Aix as long ago as 1597, had emphasised the
point that the term Son of Man should not be interpreted with reference
solely to Christ, but to the race of mankind. Hugo Grotius maintained
the same position even more emphatically. With a quite modern one-sidedness, Paulus the rationalist maintained in his commentaries and
in his Life of Jesus that according to Ezek. ii. 1 "Barnash" meant man
in general. Jesus, he thought, whenever He used the expression the Son
of Man, pointed to Himself and thus gave it the sense of "this man."
In taking this line he gives up the general reference to mankind as a
whole for which Mark ii. 28 is generally cited as the classical passage.
The suggestion that the term Son of Man in its apocalyptic signification
was first attributed to Jesus at a later time and that the passages where
it occurs in this sense are therefore suspicious, was first put forward by
Fr. Aug. Fritzsche. He hoped in this way to get rid of Matt. x. 23. De
Lagarde, like Paulus, emphatically asserted that Son of Man only meant

very meritorious work in the publication of Early Christian writings.

man. But instead of the clumsy explanation of the rationalist he save
another and a more pleasing one, namely, that Jesus by choosing this
title designed to ennoble mankind. Wellhausen, in his "History of Israel
and of the Jews" (1894), remarked on it as strange that Jesus should
have called Himself "the Man." B. D. Eerdmans, taking the apocalyptic
significance of the term as his starting-point, attempted to carry out
consistently the theory of the later interpolation of this title into the savings of Jesus. [1]
<P>
Thus Lietzmann had predecessors; but they were not so in any real
sense. They had either started out from the Marcan passage where the
Son of Man is described as the Lord of the Sabbath, and endeavoured
arbitrarily to interpret all the Son-of-Man passages in the same sense-or they assumed without sufficient grounds that the title Son of Man
was a later interpolation. The new idea consisted in combining the two
attempts, and declaring the passages about the Son of Man to be linguistically and historically impossible, seeing that, on linguistic grounds,
"son of man" means "man."
<P>
Arnold Meyer and Wellhausen expressed themselves in the same sense
as Lietzmann. The passages where Jesus uses the expression in an unmistakably Messianic sense are, according to them, to be put down to
the account of Early Christian theology. The only passages which in their
opinion are historically tenable are the two or three in which the expression denotes man in general, or is equivalent to the simple "I."
These latter were felt to be a difficulty by the Church when it came to
think in Greek, since this way of speaking of oneself was strange to
them; consequently the expression appeared to them deliberately enigmatic and only capable of being interpreted in the sense which it bears
in Daniel. The Son-of-Man conception, argued Lietzmann, when he again
approached the question two years later, had arisen in a Hellenistic environment, [2] on the basis of Dan. vii. 13; N. Schmidt, [3] too, saw in the
apocalyptic Bar-Nasha passages which follow the revelation of the
Messiahship at Caesarea Philippi an interpolation from the later apocalyptic theology. On the other hand, P. Schmiedel still wished to make it
a Messianic designation, and to take it as being historical in this sense
even in passages in which the term man "gave a possible sense." [4] H.

Gunkel thought that it was possible to translate Bar-Nasha simply by
"man," and nevertheless hold to the historicity of the expression as a
self-designation of Jesus. Jesus, he suggests, had borrowed this enigmatic
term, which goes back to Dan. vii. 13, from the mystical apocalyptic
literature, meaning thereby to indicate that He was the Man of
God in contrast to the Man of Sin. [1]
<P>
Holtzmann felt a kind of relief in handing over to the philologists the
obstinate problem which since the time of Baldensperger and Weiss had
caused so much trouble to theologians, and wanted to postpone the
historical discussion until the Aramaic experts had settled the linguistic
question. That happened sooner than was expected. In 1898 Dalman
declared in his epoch-making work (<i>Die Worte Jesu</i>) that he could not
admit the linguistic objections to the use of the expression Son of Man
by Jesus. "Biblical Aramaic," he says, "does not differ in this respect
from Hebrew. The simple [Man] and not [Son of Man] is the term for man." . . .
It was only later that the Jewish-GaIilaean dialect, like the Palestinian-
Christian dialect, used [Son of Man] for man, though in both idioms the simple
[Man] occurs in the sense of "some one." "In view of the whole facts of
the case," he continues, "what has to be said is that Jewish-Palestinian
Aramaic of the earlier period used [Man] for 'man,' and occasionally to
designate a plurality of men makes use of the expression [Sons of Man]. The
singular [Son of Man] was not current, and was only used in imitation of the
Hebrew text of the Bible, where [Son of MAn] belongs to the poetic diction, and
is, moreover, not of very frequent occurrence." "It is," he says else-
where, "by no means a sign of a sound historical method, instead of
working patiently at the solution of the problem, to hasten like Oort
and Lietzmann to the conclusion that the absence of the expression in
the New Testament Epistles is a proof that Jesus did not use it either,
but that there was somewhere or other a Hellenistic community in the
Early Church which had a predilection for this name, and often made
Jesus speak of Himself in the Gospel narrative in the third person, in
order to find an opportunity of bringing it in."

bilities were reduced by the way in which Lietzmann had posed the
problem, since the interpretations according to which Jesus had used
it in a veiled ethical Messianic sense, to indicate the ethical and spiritual
transformation of all the eschatological conceptions, were now manifestly
incapable of offering any convincing argument against the radical
denial of the use of the expression. Baldensperger rightly remarked
in a review of the whole discussion that the question which was ultimately
at stake in the combat over the title Son of Man was the question
whether Jesus was the Messiah or no, and that Dalman, by his
proof of its linguistic possibility, had saved the Messiahship of Jesus. [1]
<P>
But what kind of Messiahship? Is it any other kind than the future
Messiahship of the apocalyptic Son of Man which Johannes Weiss had
asserted? Did Jesus mean anything different by the Son of Man from
that which was meant by the apocalyptic writers? To put it otherwise:
behind the Son-of-Man problem there lies the general question whether
Jesus can have described Himself as a present Messiah; for the fundamental
difficulty is that He, a man upon earth, should give Himself out
to be the Son of Man, and at the same time apparently give to that title
a quite different sense from that which it previously possessed.
<P>
The champion of the linguistic possibility of this self-designation made
the last serious attempt to render the transformation of the conception
historically conceivable. He argues that Jesus cannot have used it as a
mere meaningless expression, a periphrasis for the simple I. [2] On the
other hand, the term cannot have been understood by the disciples as
an exalted title, or at least only in the sense that the title indicative of
exaltation is paradoxically connected with the title indicative of humility.
"We shall be justified in saying, that, for the Synoptic Evangelists,

[1] Dalman's reputation as an authority upon Jewish Aramaic is so deservedly high
that it is necessary to point out that his solution did not, as Dr. Schweitzer seems to
say, entirely dispose of the linguistic difficulties raised by Lietzmann as to the meaning
and use of <i>barnash</i> and <i>barnasha</i> in Aramaic. The English reader will find the
linguistic facts well put in sections 4 and 32 of N. Schmidt's article "Son of Man"
in <i>Encyclopedia Biblica</i> (cols. 4708, 4723), or he may consult Prof. Bevan's review
of Dalman's <i>Worte Jesu</i> in the <i>Critical Review</i> for 1899, p. 148 ff. The main point
is that <font face="Symbol">o anqrwpoV</font> and <font face="Symbol">o uioV tou anqrwpou</font> are equally legitimate translations of
<i>barnasha</i>. Thus the contrast in the Greek between <font face="Symbol">o anqrwpoV</font> and <font face="Symbol">o uioV tou anqrwpou</font> in Mark ii. 27 and 28, or again in Mark viii. 36 and 38, disappears on
retranslation into the dialect spoken by Jesus. Whether this linguistic fact makes
the sayings in which <font face="Symbol">o uioV tou anqrwpou</font> occurs unhistorical is a further question
upon which scholars can take, and have taken, opposite opinions.-F. C. B.

'Man's Son' was no title of honour for the Messiah, but-as it must
necessarily appear to a Hellenist-a veiling of His Messiahship under
a name which emphasises the humanity of its bearer." For them it was
not the references to the sufferings of "Man's Son" that were paradoxical,
but the references to His exaltation: that "Man's Son" should
be put to death is not wonderful; what is wonderful is His "coming
again upon the clouds of heaven."
<P>
If Jesus called Himself the Son of Man, the only conclusion which
could be drawn by those that heard Him was, "that for some reason or
other He desired to describe Himself as a Man par excellence." There
is no reason to think of the Heavenly Son of Man of the Similitudes of
Enoch and Fourth Ezra; that conception could hardly be present to the
minds of His auditors. "How was one who was now walking upon earth,
to come from heaven? He would have needed first to be translated
thither. One who had died or been rapt away from earth might be
brought back to earth again in this way, or a being who had never before
been upon earth, might be conceived as descending thither."
<P>
But if, on the one hand, the title Son of Man was not to be understood apart from the reference to the passage in Daniel, while on the
other Jesus so designated Himself as a man actually present upon
earth, "what was really implied was that He was the man in whom
Daniel's vision of 'one like unto a Son of Man' was being fulfilled." He
could not certainly expect from His hearers a complete understanding
of the self-designation. "We are doubtless justified in saying that in
using it, He intentionally offered them an enigma which challenged
further reflection upon His Person."
<P>
According to Peter's confession the name was intelligible to the disciples as coming from Dan. vii. 13, and obviously indicating Him who
was destined to the sovereignity of the world. Jesus calls Himself the Son
of Man, "not as meaning the lowly one, but as a scion of the human
race with its human weakness, whom nevertheless God will make Lord
of the world; and it is very probable that Jesus found the Son of Man
of Dan. vii. in Ps. viii. 5 ff. also." Sayings regarding humiliation and
suffering could be attached to the title just as well as references to exaltation. For since the "Child of Man" has placed Himself upon the
throne of God, He is in reality no longer a mere man, but ruler over
heaven and earth, "the Lord."
<P>
This attempt of Dalman's has the same significance in regard to the
question of the Messiahship as Bousset's had for the ethical question.
Just as ln Bousset's view the Kingdom of God was, in a paradoxical way,
after all proclaimed as present, so here the self-designation "Son of
Man" is retained by a paradox as conveying the sense of a present Messiahship.
But the documents do not give any support to this assumption;
<P>
<center>282</center>
<P>
on the contrary they contradict it at every point. According to Dalman
it was not the predictions of the passion of the Son of Man which
sounded paradoxical to the disciples, but the predictions of His exaltation.
But we are distinctly told that when He spoke of His passion they
did not understand the saying. The predictions of His exaltation, however,
they understood so well that without troubling themselves further
about the predictions of the sufferings, they began to dispute who should
be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, and who should have his throne
closest to the Son of Man. And if it is once admitted that Jesus took the
designation from Daniel, what ground is there for asserting that the
purely eschatological transcendental significance which the term had
taken on in the Similitudes of Enoch and retains in Fourth Ezra had no
existence for Jesus? Thus, by a long round-about, criticism has come
back to Johannes Weiss. [1] His eschatological solution of the Son-of-Man
question-the elements of which are to be found in Strauss's first Life
of Jesus-is the only possible one. Dalman expresses the same idea in
the form of a question. "How could one who was actually walking the
earth come down from heaven? He would have needed first to be translated thither.
One who had died or been rapt away from earth might
possibly be brought back to earth in this way." Having reached this
point we have only to observe further that Jesus, from the "confession
of Peter" onwards, always speaks of the Son of Man in connexion with
death and resurrection. That is to say, that once the disciples know in
what relation He stands to the Son of Man, He uses this title to suggest
the manner of His return: as the sequel to His death and resurrection
He will return to the world again as a superhuman Personality. Thus the
purely transcendental use of the term suggested by Dalman as a possibility turns out to be the historical reality.

<P>
In the second edition, of 1900, p. 160 ff., he allows himself to be led astray by
the "chiefest apostles" of modern theology to indulge in the subtleties of fine spun
psychology, and explain Jesus' way of speaking of Himself in the third person as
the Son of Man as due to the "extreme modesty of Jesus," a modesty which did
not forsake Him in the presence of His judges. This recent access of psychologist
exegesis has not conduced to clearness of presentation, and the preference for
Lucan narrative does not so much contribute to throw light on the facts as to
discover in the thoughts of Jesus subtleties of which the historical Jesus never
dreamt. If the Lord always used the term Son of Man when speaking of His
Messiahship, the reason was that this was the only way in which He could speak
at all, since the Messiahship was not yet realised, but was only to be so at the
appearing of the Son of Man. For a consistent, purely historical, non-psychological
exposition of the Son-of-Man passages see Albert Schweitzer, <i>Das Messianitats- und
Leidensgeheimnis</i>. (The Secret of the Messiahship and the Passion.) A sketch of
the Life of Jesus. Tubingen, 1901.

<center>283</center>
<P>
Broadly speaking, therefore, the Son-of-Man problem is both historically
solvable and has been solved. The authentic passages are those
in which the expression is used in that apocalyptic sense which goes back
to Daniel. But we have to distinguish two different uses of the term according
to the degree of knowledge assumed in the hearers. If the secret
of Jesus is unknown to them, then in that case they understand simply
that Jesus is speaking of the "Son of Man" and His coming without having
any suspicion that He and the Son of Man have any connexion. It
would be thus, for instance, when in sending out the disciples in Matt. x.
23 He announced the imminence of the appearing of the Son of Man; or
when He pictured the judgment which the Son of Man would hold
(Matt. xxv. 31-46), if we may imagine it to have been spoken to the
people at Jerusalem. Or, on the other hand, the secret is known to the
hearers. In that case they understand that the term Son of Man points
to the position to which He Himself is to be exalted when the present
era passes into the age to come. It was thus, no doubt, in the case of
the disciples at Caesarea Philippi, and of the High Priest to whom Jesus,
after answering his demand with the simple "Yea" (Mark xiv. 62), goes
on immediately to speak of the exaltation of the Son of Man to the
right hand of God, and of His coming upon the clouds of heaven.
<P>
Jesus did not, therefore, veil His Messiahship by using the expression
Son of Man, much less did He transform it, but He used the expression
to refer, in the only possible way, to His Messianic office as destined
to be realised at His "coming," and did so in such a manner that only
the initiated understood that He was speaking of His own coming, while
others understood Him as referring to the coming of a Son of Man
who was other than Himself.
<P>
The passages where the title has not this apocalyptic reference, or
where, previous to the incident at Caesarea Philippi, Jesus in speaking
to the disciples equates the Son of Man with His own "ego," are to be
explained as of literary origin. This set of secondary occurrences of the
title has nothing to do with "Early Church theology"; it is merely a
question of phenomena of translation and tradition. In the saying about
the Sabbath in Mark ii. 28, and perhaps also in the saying about the
right to forgive sins in Mark ii. 10, Son of Man doubtless stood in the
original in the general sense of "man," but was later, certainly by our
Evangelists, understood as referring to Jesus as the Son of Man. In
other passages tradition, following the analogy of those passages in
which the title is authentic, put in place of the simple I-expressed in
Aramaic by "the man"-the self-designation "Son of Man," as we
can clearly show by comparing Matt. xvi. 13, "Who do men say that the
the Son of Man is?" with Mark viii. 27, "Who do men say that I am?"
<P>
Three passages call for special discussion. In the statement that a
<P>
<center>284</center>
<P>
man may be forgiven for blasphemy against the Son of Man but not
for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, in Matt. xii. 32, the "Son of
Man" may be authentic. But of course it would not, even in that case,
give any hint that "Son of Man designates the Messiah in His humiliation"
as Dalman wished to infer from the passage, but would mean that
Jesus was speaking of the Son of Man, here as elsewhere, in the third
person without reference to Himself, and was thinking of a contemptuous
denial of the Parousia such as might have been uttered by a Sadducee.
But if we take into account the parallel in Mark iii. 28 and 29
where blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is spoken of without any mention
of blasphemy against the Son of Man, it seems more natural to take
the mention of the Son of Man as a secondary interpolation, derived
from the same line of tradition, perhaps from the same hand, as the
"Son of Man" in the question to the disciples at Caesarea Philippi.
<P>
The two other sayings, the one about the Son of Man "who hath not
where to lay His head," Matt. viii. 20, and that about the Son of Man
who must submit to the reproach of being a glutton and a wine-bibber
Matt. xi. 19, belong together. If we assume it to be possible, in conformity
with the saying about the purpose of the parables in Mark iv.
11 and 12, that Jesus sometimes spoke words which He did not intend
to be understood, we may-if we are unwilling to accept the supposition
of a later periphrasis for the ego, which would certainly be the most
natural explanation-recognise in these sayings two obscure declarations
regarding the Son of Man. They would then be supposed to have
meant in the original form, which is no longer clearly recognisable, that
the Son of Man would in some way justify the conduct of Jesus of
Nazareth. But the way in which this idea is expressed was not such as
to make it easy for His hearers to identify Him with the Son of Man.
Moreover, it was for them a conception impossible to realise, since Jesus
was a natural, and the Son of Man a supernatural, being; and the eschatological
scheme of things had not provided for a man who at the end
of the existing era should hint to others that at the great transformation
of all things He would be manifested as the Son of Man. This case presented
itself only in the course of history, and it created a preparatory
stage of eschatology which does not answer to any traditional scheme.
<P>
That act of the self-consciousness of Jesus by which He recognised
Himself in His earthly existence as the future Messiah is the act in which
eschatology supremely affirms itself. At the same time, since it brings,
spiritually, that which is to come, into the unaltered present, into the
existing era, it is the end of eschatology. For it is its "spiritualisation,"
a spiritualisation of which the ultimate consequence was to be that all
its "supersensuous" elements were to be realised only spiritually in the
present earthly conditions, and all that is affirmed as supersensuous in
<P>
<center>285</center>
<P>
the transcendental sense was to be regarded as only the ruined remains
of an eschatological world-view. The Messianic secret of Jesus is the
basis of Christianity, since it involves the de-nationalising and the
spiritualisation of Jewish eschatology.
<P>
Yet more. It is the primal fact, the starting-point of a process which
manifests itself, indeed, in Christianity, but cannot fully work itself out
even here, of a movement in the direction of inwardness which brings
all religious magnitudes into the one indivisible spiritual present, and
which Christian dogmatic has not ventured to carry to its completion.
The Messianic consciousness of the uniquely great Man of Nazareth sets
up a struggle between the present and the beyond, and introduces that
resolute absorption of the beyond by the present, which in looking back
we recognise as the history of Christianity, and of which we are conscious
in ourselves as the essence of religious progress and experience
-a process of which the end is not yet in sight.
<P>
In this sense Jesus did "accept the world" and did stand in conflict
with Judaism. Protestantism was a step-a step on which hung weighty
consequences-in the progress of that "acceptance of the world" which
was constantly developing itself from within. By a mighty revolution
which was in harmony with the spirit of that great primal act of the
consciousness of Jesus, though in opposition to some of the most certain
of His sayings, ethics became world-accepting. But it will be a mightier
revolution still when the last remaining ruins of the supersensuous
other-worldly system of thought are swept away in order to clear the
site for a new spiritual, purely real and present world. All the inconsistent
compromises and constructions of modern theology are merely
an attempt to stave off the final expulsion of eschatology from religion,
an inevitable but a hopeless attempt. That proleptic Messianic consciousness
of Jesus, which was in reality the only possible actualisation of the
Messianic idea, carries these consequences with it inexorably and unfailingly.
At that last cry upon the cross the whole eschatological supersensuous
world fell in upon itself in ruins, and there remained as a
spiritual reality only that present spiritual world, bound as it is to sense,
which Jesus by His all-powerful word had called into being within
the world which He contemned. That last cry, with its despairing abandonment
of the eschatological future, is His real acceptance of the world.
The "Son of Man" was buried in the ruins of the falling eschatological
world; there remained alive only Jesus "the Man." Thus these two
Aramaic synonyms include in themselves, as in a symbol of reality, all
that was to come.
<P>
If theology has found it so hard a task to arrive at an historical comprehension
of the secret of this self-designation, this is due to the fact that
the question is not a purely historical one. In this word there lies
<P>
<center>286</center>
<P>
the transformation of a whole system of thought, the inexorable consequence
of the elimination of eschatology from religion. It was only in
this future form, not as actual, that Jesus spoke of His Messiahship.
Modern theology keeps on endeavouring to discover in the title of Son
of Man, which is bound up with the future, a humanised present Messiahship.
It does so in the conviction that the recognition of a purely
future reference in the Messianic consciousness of Jesus would lead
in the last result to a modification of the historic basis of our faith
which has itself become historical, and therefore true and self-justifying.
The recognition of the claims of eschatology signifies for our dogmatic
a burning of the boats by which it felt itself able to return at any moment
from the time of Jesus direct to the present.
<P>
One point that is worthy of notice in this connexion is the trustworthiness
of the tradition. The Evangelists, writing in Greek, and the Greek-speaking
Early Church, can hardly have retained an understanding of
the purely eschatological character of that self-designation of Jesus. It
had become for them merely an indirect method of self-designation. And
nevertheless the Evangelists, especially Mark, record the sayings of
Jesus in such a way that the original significance and application of the
designation in His mouth is still clearly recognisable, and we are able to
determine with certainty the isolated cases in which this self-designation
in His discourses is of a secondary origin.
<P>
Thus the use of the term Son of Man-which, if we admitted the
sweeping proposal of Lietzmann and Wellhausen to cancel it everywhere
as an interpolation of Greek Early Church theology, would throw
doubt on the whole of the Gospel tradition-becomes a proof of the
certainty and trustworthiness of that tradition. We may, in fact, say that
the progressive recognition of the eschatological character of the teaching
and action of Jesus carries with it a progressive justification of the
Gospel tradition. A series of passages and discourses which had been
endangered because from the modern theological point of view which
had been made the criterion of the tradition they appeared to be without
meaning, are now secured. The stone which the critics rejected has become
the corner-stone of the tradition.
<P>
If Aramaic scholarship appears in regard to the Son-of-Man question
among the opponents of the thorough-going eschatological view, it takes
no other position in connexion with the retranslations and in the application
of illustrative parallels from the Rabbinic literature.
<P>
In looking at the earlier works in this department, one is struck with
the smallness of the result in proportion to the labour expended. The

Delitzsch, Carl Siegfried, and A. Wunsche. [1] But even a work like F.
Weber's <i>System der altsynagogalen palastinensischen Theologie</i>, [2] which
does not confine itself to single sayings and thoughts, but aims at exhibiting
the Rabbinic system of thought as a whole, throws, in the main,
but little light on the thoughts of Jesus. The Rabbinic parables supply,
according to Julicher, but little of value for the explanation of the parables
of Jesus. [3] In this method of discourse, Jesus is so pre-eminently
original, that any other productions of the Jewish parabolic literature
are like stunted undergrowth beside a great tree; though that has not
prevented His originality from being challenged in this very department,
both in earlier times and at the present. As early as 1648, Robert
Sheringham, of Cambridge, [4] suggested that the parables in Matt. xx. 1
ff., xxv. 1 ft., and Luke xvi., were derived from Talmudic sources, an
opinion against which J. B. Carpzov, the younger, raised a protest; in
1839, F. Nork asserted, in his work on "Rabbinic Sources and Parallels
for the New Testament Writings," that the best thoughts in the discourses
of Jesus are to be attributed to His Jewish teachers; in 1880 the Dutch
Rabbi, T. Tal, maintained the thesis that the parables of the New Testament
are all borrowed from the Talmud. [8] Theories of this kind cannot
be refuted, because they lack the foundation necessary to any theory

which is to be capable of being rationally discussed-that of plain common sense. [1]
<P>
We possess, however, really scientific attempts to define more closely
the thoughts of Jesus by the aid of the Rabbinic language and Rabbinic
ideas in the works of Arnold Meyer and Dalman. It cannot indeed be
said that the obscure sayings which form the problem of present-day
exegesis are in all cases made clearer by them, much as we may admire
the comprehensive knowledge of these scholars. Sometimes, indeed,
they become more obscure than before. According to Meyer, for instance,
the question of Jesus whether His disciples can drink of His cup,
and be baptized with His baptism means, if put back into Aramaic, "Can
you drink as bitter a drink as I; can you eat as sharply salted meat as
I?" [2] Nor does Dalman's Aramaic retranslation help us much with the
saying about the violent who take the Kingdom of Heaven by force.
According to him, it is not spoken of the faithful, but of the rulers of this
world, and refers to the epoch of the Divine rule which has been introduced
by the imprisonment of the Baptist. No one can violently possess
himself of the Divine reign, and Jesus can therefore only mean that
violence is done to it in the person of its subjects.
<P>
On this it must be remarked, that if the saying really means this, it
is about as appropriate to its setting as a rock in the sky. Jesus is not
speaking of the imprisonment of the Baptist. By the days of John the
Baptist He means the time of his public ministry.
<P>
It is equally open to question whether in putting that crucial question
regarding the Messiah in Mark xii. 37 He really intended to show, as
Dalman thinks, "that physical descent from David was not of decisive
importance-it did not belong to the essence of the Messiahship."
<P>
But a point in regard to which Dalman's remarks are of great value
for the reconstruction of the life of Jesus is the entry into Jerusalem.
Dalman thinks that the simple "Hosanna, blessed be he that cometh in
the name of the Lord" (Mark xi. 9) was what the people really shouted
in acclamation, and that the additional words in Mark and Matthew are
simply an interpretative expansion. This acclamation did not itself contain
any Messianic reference. This explains "why the entry into Jeru-
<P>
[1] The question may be said to have been provisionally settled by Paul Fiebig's
work, <i>Altjudische Gleichnisse und die Gleichnisse Jesu</i> (Ancient Jewish Parables
and the Parables of Jesus), Tubingen, 1904, in which he gives some fifty Late-Jewish
parables, and compares them with those of Jesus, the final result being
show more clearly than ever the uniqueness and absoluteness of His creations.
<P>
[2] See the explanation by means of the Aramaic of a selection of the saying
Jesus in Meyer, pp. 72-90. A Judaism more under Parsee influence is assumed as 
explaining the origin of Christianity by E. Boklen, <i>Die Verviandschaft der judisch-christlichen mit der parsischen Eschatologie</i> (The Relation of Jewish-Christian to
Persian Eschatology), 1902, 510 ff.

<P>
salem was not made a count in the charge urged against Him before
Pilate." The events of "Palm Sunday" only received their distinctively
Messianic colour later. It was not the Messiah, but the prophet and
wonder-worker of Galilee whom the people hailed with rejoicing and
accompanied with invocations of blessing. [1]
<P>
Generally speaking, the value of Dalman's work lies less in the solutions
which it offers than in the problems which it raises. By its very
thorough discussions it challenges historical theology to test its most
cherished assumptions regarding the teaching of Jesus, and make sure
whether they are really so certain and self-evident. Thus, in opposition
to Schurer, he denies that the thought of the pre-existence in heaven of
all the good things belonging to the Kingdom of God was at all generally
current in the Late-Jewish world of ideas, and thinks that the occasional
references [2] to a pre-existing Jerusalem, which shall finally be brought
down to the earth, do not suffice to establish the theory. Similarly, he
thinks it doubtful whether Jesus used the terms "this world (age)," "the
world (age) to come" in the eschatological sense which is generally
attached to them, and doubts, on linguistic grounds, whether they can
have been used at all. Even the use of [Hebrew] or [Hebrew] for "world" cannot
be proved. In the pre-Christian period there is much reason to doubt
its occurrence, though in later Jewish literature it is frequent. The expression
<font face="Symbol">en th paliggenesia</font> in Matt. xix. 28, is specifically Greek and
cannot be reproduced in either Hebrew or Aramaic. It is very strange
that the use which Jesus makes of <i>Amen</i> is unknown in the whole of
Jewish literature. According to the proper idiom of the language "[Hebrew]
is never used to emphasise one's own speech, but always with reference
to the speech, prayer, benediction, oath, or curse of another." Jesus,
therefore, if He used the expression in this sense, must have given it
a new meaning as a formula of asseveration, in place of the oath which
He forbade.
<P>
All these acute observations are marked by the general tendency
which was observable in the interpretation of the term Son of Man,
that is, by the endeavour so to weaken down the eschatological conceptions
of the Kingdom and the Messiah, that the hypothesis of a making-present
and spiritualising of these conceptions in the teaching of
Jesus might appear inherently and linguistically possible and natural.
The polemic against the pre-existent realities of the Kingdom of God
is intended to show that for Jesus the Reign of God is a present benefit,
which can be sought after, given, possessed, and taken. Even before the

[1] The same view is expressed by Wellhausen, <i>Israelitische und judische Geschichte</i>, 3rd ed., p. 381, note 2; and by Albert Schweitzer, <i>Das Messianitats- und Leidensgekeimnis</i>, 1901.

<center>290</center>
<P>
time of Jesus, according to Dalman, a tendency had shown itself to lay
less emphasis, in connexion with the hope of the future, upon the national
Jewish element. Jesus forced this element still farther into the
background, and gave a more decided prominence to the purely religious
element. "For Him the reign of God was the Divine power
which from this time onward was steadily to carry forward the renewal
of the world, and also the renewed world, into which men shall one day
enter, which even now offers itself, and therefore can be grasped and
received as a present good." The supernatural coming of the Kingdom
is only the final stage of the coming which is now being inwardly spiritually
brought about by the preaching of Jesus. Though He may perhaps
have spoken of "this" world and the "world to come," these expressions
had in His use of them no very special importance. It is for Him less
a question of an antithesis between "then" and "now," than of establishing
a connexion between them by which the transition from one to
the other is to be effected.
<P>
It is the same in regard to Jesus' consciousness of His Messiahship.
"In Jesus' view," says Dalman, "the period before the commencement
of the Reign of God was organically connected with the actual period
of His Reign." He was the Messiah because He knew Himself to stand
in a unique ethico-religious relation to God. His Messiahship was not
something wholly incomprehensible to those about Him. If redemption
was regarded as being close at hand, the Messiah must be assumed to
be in some sense already present. Therefore Jesus is both directly and
indirectly spoken of as Messiah.
<P>
Thus the most important work in the department of Aramaic scholarship
shows clearly the anti-eschatological tendency which characterised
it from the beginning. The work of Lietzmann, Meyer, Wellhausen, and
Dalman, forms a distinct episode in the general resistance to eschatology.
That Aramaic scholarship should have taken up a hostile attitude
towards the eschatological system of thought of Jesus lies in the nature
of things. The thoughts which it takes as its standard of comparison
were only reduced to writing long after the period of Jesus, and, moreover,
in a lifeless and distorted form, at a time when the apocalyptic
temper no longer existed as the living counterpoise to the legal righteousness,
and this legal righteousness had allowed only so much of Apocalyptic
to survive as could be brought into direct connexion with it. In
fact, the distance between Jesus' world of thought and this form of
Judaism is as great as that which separates it from modern ideas. Thus
in Dalman modernising tendencies and Aramaic scholarship were able
to combine in conducting a criticism of the eschatology in the teaching
of Jesus in which the modern man thought the thoughts and the expert
in Aramaic formulated and supported them, yet without being able in
<P>
<center>291</center>
<P>
the end to make any impression upon the well-rounded whole formed by
Jesus' eschatological preaching of the Kingdom.
<P>
Whether Aramaic scholarship will contribute to the investigation of
the life and teaching of Jesus along other lines and in a direct and positive
fashion, only the future can show. But certainly if theologians will
give heed to the question-marks so acutely placed by Dalman, and recognise
it as one of their first duties to test carefully whether a thought or
a connexion of thought is linguistically or inherently Greek, and only
Greek, in character, they will derive a notable advantage from what has
already been done in the department of Aramaic study.
<P>
But if the service rendered by Aramaic studies has been hitherto
mainly indirect, no success whatever has attended, or seems likely to
attend, the attempt to apply Buddhist ideas to the explanation of the
thoughts of Jesus. It could only indeed appear to have some prospect
of success if we could make up our minds to follow the example of the
author of one of the most recent of fictitious lives of Christ in putting
Jesus to school to the Buddhist priests; in which case the six years
which Monsieur Nicolas Notowitsch allots to this purpose, would certainly
be none too much for the completion of the course. [1] If imagination
boggles at this, there remains no possibility of showing that Buddhist
ideas exercised any direct influence upon Jesus. That Buddhism
may have had some kind of influence upon Late Judaism and thus indirectly
upon Jesus is not inherently impossible, if we are prepared to
recognise Buddhistic influence on the Babylonian and Persian civilisations.
But it is unproved, unprovable, and unthinkable, that Jesus derived
the suggestion of the new and creative ideas which emerge in His
teaching from Buddhism. The most that can be done in this direction is
to point to certain analogies. For the parables of Jesus, Buddhist
parallels were suggested by Renan and Havet. [2]
<P>
How little these analogies mean in the eyes of a cautious observer is
evident from the attitude which Max Muller took up towards the question.
"That there are startling coincidences between Buddhism and
Christianity," he remarks in one passage, [3] "cannot be denied; and it
must likewise be admitted that Buddhism existed at least four hundred
years before Christianity. I go even further and say that I should be
extremely grateful if anybody would point out to me the historical
channels through which Buddhism had influenced early Christianity. I
have been looking for such channels all my life, but hitherto I have found
none. What I have found is that for some of the most startling coin-

<P>
<center>292</center>
<P>
cidences there are historical antecedents on both sides; and if we once
know these antecedents the coincidences become far less startling."
<P>
A year before Max Muller formulated his impression in these terms
Rudolf Seydel1 had endeavoured to explain the analogies which had
been noticed by supposing Christianity to have been influenced bv
Buddhism. He distinguishes three distinct classes of analogies:
<P>
1. Those of which the points of resemblance can without difficulty
be explained as due to the influence of similar sources and motives
in the two cases.
<P>
2. Those which show a so special and unexpected agreement that it
appears artificial to explain it from the action of similar causes, and
the dependence of one upon the other commends itself as the most
natural explanation.
<P>
3. Those in which there exists a reason for the occurrence of the idea
only within the sphere of one of the two religions, or in which at least
it can very much more easily be conceived as originating within the one
than within the other, so that the inexplicability of the phenomenon
within the one domain gives ground for seeking its source within the
other.
<P>
This last class demands a literary explanation of the analogy. Seydel
therefore postulates, alongside of primitive forms of Matthew and Luke,
a third source, "a poetic-apocalyptic Gospel of very early date which
fitted its Christian material into the frame of a Buddhist type of Gospel,
transforming, purifying, and ennobling the material taken from the
foreign but related literature by a kind of rebirth inspired by the Christian
Spirit." Matthew and Luke, especially Luke, follow this poetic
Gospel up to the point where historic sources become more abundant,
and the primitive form of Mark begins to dominate their narrative. But
even in later parts the influence of this poetical source, which as an independent
document was subsequently lost, continued to make itself felt.
<P>
The strongest point of support for this hypothesis, if a mere con-

Buddha Legend and the Teaching of Buddha, with constant reference to other

jecture can be described as such, is found by Seydel in the introductory
narratives in Luke. Now it is not inherently impossible that Buddhist
legends which in one form or another were widely current in the East,
may have contributed more or less to the formation of the mythical
preliminary history. Who knows the laws of the formation of legend?
Who can follow the course of the wind which carries the seed over land
and sea? But in general it may be said that Seydel actually refutes the
hypothesis which he is defending. If the material which he brings
forward is all that there is to suggest a relation between Buddhism and
Christianity, we are justified in waiting until new discoveries are made
in that quarter before asserting the necessity of a Buddhist primitive
Gospel. That will not prevent a succession of theosophic Lives of Jesus
from finding their account in Seydel's classical work. Seydel indeed
delivered himself into their hands, because he did not entirely avoid the
rash assumption of theosophic "historical science" that Jewish eschatology
can be equated with Buddhistic.
<P>
Eduard von Hartmann, in the second edition of his work, "The Christianity
of the New Testament," [1] roundly asserts that there can be no
question of any relation of Jesus to Buddha, nor of any indebtedness
either in His teaching or in the later moulding of the story of His life,
but only of a parallel formation of myth.
