<center><h2>THE PROBLEM</h2></center>
<P>
WHEN, AT SOME FUTURE DAY, OUR PERIOD OF CIVILISATION SHALL LIE,
closed and completed, before the eyes of later generations, German
theology will stand out as a great, a unique phenomenon in the mental
and spiritual life of our time. For nowhere save in the German temperament can there be found in the same perfection the living complex of
conditions and factors — of philosophic thought, critical acumen, historical insight, and religious feeling — without which no deep theology
is possible.
<P>
And the greatest achievement of German theology is the critical investigation of the life of Jesus. What it has accomplished here has laid
down the conditions and determined the course of the religious thinking
of the future.
<P>
In the history of doctrine its work has been negative; it has, so to
speak, cleared the site for a new edifice of religious thought. In describing how the ideas of Jesus were taken possession of by the Greek spirit,
it was tracing the growth of that which must necessarily become strange
to us, and, as a matter of fact, has become strange to us.
<P>
Of its efforts to create a new dogmatic we scarcely need to have the
history written; it is alive within us. It is no doubt interesting to trace
how modern thoughts have found their way into the ancient dogmatic
system, there to combine with eternal ideas to form new constructions;
it is interesting to penetrate into the mind of the thinker in which this
process is at work; but the real truth of that which here meets us as
history we experience within ourselves. As in the monad of Leibnitz the
whole universe is reflected, so we intuitively experience within us, even
apart from any clear historical knowledge, the successive stages of the
progress of modern dogma, from rationalism to Ritschl. This experience
is true knowledge, all the truer because we are conscious of the whole
as something indefinite, a slow and difficult movement towards a goal
which is still shrouded in obscurity. We have not yet arrived at any
reconciliation between history and modern thought — only between half-way history and half-way thought. What the ultimate goal towards
<P>
<center>2</center>
<P>
which we are moving will be, what this something is which shall bring
new life and new regulative principles to coming centuries, we do not
know. We can only dimly divine that it will be the mighty deed of some
mighty original genius, whose truth and rightness will be proved by the
fact that we, working at our poor half thing, will oppose him might and
main — we who imagine we long for nothing more eagerly than a genius
powerful enough to open up with authority a new path for the world,
seeing that we cannot succeed in moving it forward along the track
which we have so laboriously prepared.
<P>
For this reason the history of the critical study of the life of Jesus is
of higher intrinsic value than the history of the study of ancient dogma
or of the attempts to create a new one. It has to describe the most tremendous thing which the religious consciousness has ever dared and
done. In the study of the history of dogma German theology settled its
account with the past; in its attempt to create a new dogmatic, it was
endeavouring to keep a place for the religious life in the thought of the
present; in the study of the life of Jesus it was working for the future —
in pure faith in the truth, not seeing whereunto it wrought.
<P>
Moreover, we are here dealing with the most vital thing in the world's
history. There came a Man to rule over the world; He ruled it for good
and for ill, as history testifies; He destroyed the world into which He was
born; the spiritual life of our own time seems like to perish at His hands,
for He leads to battle against our thought a host of dead ideas, a ghostly
army upon which death has no power, and Himself destroys again the
truth and goodness which His Spirit creates in us, so that it cannot rule
the world. That He continues, notwithstanding, to reign as the alone
Great and alone True in a world of which He denied the continuance, is
the prime example of that antithesis between spiritual and natural truth
which underlies all life and all events, and in Him emerges into the field
of history.
<P>
It is only at first sight that the absolute indifference of early Christianity towards the life of the historical Jesus is disconcerting. When
Paul, representing those who recognise the signs of the times, did not
desire to know Christ after the flesh, that was the first expression of the
impulse of self-preservation by which Christianity continued to be
guided for centuries. It felt that with the introduction of the historic
Jesus into its faith, there would arise something new, something which
had not been foreseen in the thoughts of the Master Himself, and that
thereby a contradiction would be brought to light, the solution of which
would constitute one of the great problems of the world.
<P>
Primitive Christianity was therefore right to live wholly in the future
with the Christ who was to come, and to preserve of the historic Jesus
only detached sayings, a few miracles, His death and resurrection. By
<P>
<center>3</center>
<P>
abolishing both the world and the historical Jesus it escaped the inner
division described above, and remained consistent in its point of view.
We, on our part, have reason to be grateful to the early Christians that,
in consequence of this attitude they have handed down to us, not biographies of Jesus but only Gospels, and that therefore we possess the Idea
and the Person with the minimum of historical and contemporary
limitations.
<P>
But the world continued to exist, and its continuance brought this
one-sided view to an end. The supra-mundane Christ and the historical
Jesus of Nazareth had to be brought together into a single personality at
once historical and raised above time. That was accomplished by Gnosticism and the Logos Christology. Both, from opposite standpoints,
because they were seeking the same goal, agreed in sublimating the his-
torical Jesus into the supra-mundane Idea. The result of this development, which followed on the discrediting of eschatology, was that the
historical Jesus was again introduced into the field of view of Christianity, but in such a way that all justification for, and interest in, the
investigation of His life and historical personality were done away with.
<P>
Greek theology was as indifferent in regard to the historical Jesus who
lives concealed in the Gospels as was the early eschatological theology.
More than that, it was dangerous to Him; for it created a new supernatural-historical Gospel, and we may consider it fortunate that the
Synoptics were already so firmly established that the Fourth Gospel
could not oust them; instead, the Church, as though from the inner
necessity of the antitheses which now began to be a constructive element
in her thought, was obliged to set up two antithetic Gospels alongside
of one another.
<P>
When at Chalcedon the West overcame the East, its doctrine of the
two natures dissolved the unity of the Person, and thereby cut off the last
possibility of a return to the historical Jesus. The self-contradiction was
elevated into a law. But the Manhood was so far admitted as to preserve,
in appearance, the rights of history. Thus by a deception the formula
kept the life prisoner and prevented the leading spirits of the Reformation from grasping the idea of a return to the historical Jesus.
<P>
This dogma had first to be shattered before men could once more go
out in quest of the historical Jesus, before they could even grasp the
thought of His existence. That the historic Jesus is something different
from the Jesus Christ of the doctrine of the Two Natures seems to us
now self-evident. We can, at the present day, scarcely imagine the long
agony in which the historical view of the life of Jesus came to birth. And
even when He was once more recalled to life. He was still, like Lazarus
of old, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes — the grave-clothes of the
dogma of the Dual Nature. Hase relates, in the preface to his first Life of
<P>
<center>4</center>
<P>
Jesus (1829), that a worthy old gentleman, hearing of his project, advised
him to treat in the first part of the human, in the second of the divine
Nature. There was a fine simplicity about that. But does not the simplicity cover a presentiment of the revolution of thought for which the
historical method of study was preparing the way — a presentiment which
those who were engaged in the work did not share in the same measure?
It was fortunate that they did not; for otherwise how could they have
had the courage to go on?
<P>
The historical investigation of the life of Jesus did not take its rise
from a purely historical interest; it turned to the Jesus of history as an
ally in the struggle against the tyranny of dogma. Afterwards when it
was freed from this <font face="Symbol">paqoV</font> it sought to present the historic Jesus in a
form intelligible to its own time. For Bahrdt and Venturini He was the
tool of a secret order. They wrote under the impression of the immense
influence exercised by the Order of the Illuminati[1] at the end of the
eighteenth century. For Reinhard, Hess, Paulus, and the rest of the
rationalistic writers He is the admirable revealer of true virtue, which
is coincident with right reason. Thus each successive epoch of theology
found its own thoughts in Jesus; that was, indeed, the only way in which
it could make Him live.
<P>
But it was not only each epoch that found its reflection in Jesus; each
individual created Him in accordance with his own character. There is
no historical task which so reveals a man's true self as the writing of a
Life of Jesus. No vital force comes into the figure unless a man breathes
into it all the hate or all the love of which he is capable. The stronger
the love, or the stronger the hate, the more life-like is the figure which
is produced. For hate as well as love can write a Life of Jesus, and the
greatest of them are written with hate: that of Reimarus, the Wolfenbiittel Fragmentist, and that of David Friedrich Strauss. It was not so
much hate of the Person of Jesus as of the supernatural nimbus with
which it was so easy to surround Him, and with which He had in fact
been surrounded. They were eager to picture Him as truly and purely
human, to strip from Him the robes of splendour with which He had
been apparelled, and clothe Him once more with the coarse garments in
which He had walked in Galilee.
<P>
And their hate sharpened their historical insight. They advanced the
study of the subject more than all the others put together. But for the
offence which they gave, the science of historical theology would not

[1] An order founded in 1776 by Professor Adam Weishaupt of Ingolstadt in
Bavaria. Its aim was the furtherance of rational religion as opposed to orthodox
dogma; its organisation was largely modelled on that of the Jesuits. At its most
flourishing period it numbered over 2000 members, including the rulers of several
German States.—TRANSLATOR.
<P>
<center>5</center>
<P>
have stood where it does to-day. "It must needs be that offences come;
but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh." Reimarus evaded that
woe by keeping the offence to himself and preserving silence during his
lifetime — his work, "The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples," was only
published after his death, by Lessing. But in the case of Strauss, who, as
a young man of twenty-seven, cast the offence openly in the face of the
world, the woe fulfilled itself. His "Life of Jesus" was his ruin. But he did
not cease to be proud of it in spite of all the misfortune that it brought
him. "I might well bear a grudge against my book," he writes twenty-five
years later in the preface to the "Conversations of Ulrich von Hutten," [1]
"for it has done me much evil ('And rightly so!' the pious will exclaim).
It has excluded me from public teaching in which I took pleasure and for
which I had perhaps some talent; it has torn me from natural relationships and driven me into unnatural ones; it has made my life a lonely
one. And yet when I consider what it would have meant if I had refused
to utter the word which lay upon my soul, if I had suppressed the doubts
which were at work in my mind — then I bless the book which has doubtless done me grievous harm outwardly, but which preserved the inward
health of my mind and heart, and, I doubt not, has done the same for
many others also."
<P>
Before him, Bahrdt had his career broken in consequence of revealing
his beliefs concerning the Life of Jesus; and after him, Bruno Bauer.
<P>
It was easy for them, resolved as they were to open the way even with
seeming blasphemy. But the others, those who tried to bring Jesus to
life at the call of love, found it a cruel task to be honest. The critical
study of the life of Jesus has been for theology a school of honesty. The
world had never seen before, and will never see again, a struggle for
truth so full of pain and renunciation as that of which the Lives of Jesus
of the last hundred years contain the cryptic record. One must lead the
successive Lives of Jesus with which Hase followed the course of the
study from the 'twenties to the 'seventies of the nineteenth century to get
an inkling of what it must have cost the men who lived through that decisive period really to maintain that "courageous freedom of investigation" which the great Jena professor, in the preface to his first Life of
Jesus, claims for his researches. One sees in him the marks of the struggle
with which he gives up, bit by bit, things which, when he wrote that
preface, he never dreamed he would have to surrender. It was fortunate
for these men that their sympathies sometimes obscured their critical
vision, so that, without becoming insincere, they were able to take white
clouds for distant mountains. That was the kindly fate of Hase and
Beyschlag.

<P>
The personal character of the study is not only due, however, to the
fact that a personality can only be awakened to life by the touch of a
personality; it lies in the essential nature of the problem itself. For the
problem of the life of Jesus has no analogue in the field of history. No
historical school has ever laid down canons for the investigation of this
problem, no professional historian has ever lent his aid to theology in
dealing with it. Every ordinary method of historical investigation proves
inadequate to the complexity of the conditions. The standards of ordinary historical science are here inadequate, its methods not immediately
applicable. The historical study of the life of Jesus has had to create its
own methods for itself. In the constant succession of unsuccessful attempts, five or six problems have emerged side by side which together
constitute the fundamental problem. There is, however, no direct method
of solving the problem in its complexity; all that can be done is to
experiment continuously, starting from definite assumptions; and in this
experimentation the guiding principle must ultimately rest upon historical intuition.
<P>
The cause of this lies in the nature of the sources of the life of Jesus,
and in the character of our knowledge of the contemporary religious
world of thought. It is not that the sources are in themselves bad. When
we have once made up our minds that we have not the materials for a
complete Life of Jesus, but only for a picture of His public ministry, it
must be admitted that there are few characters of antiquity about whom
we possess so much indubitably historical information, of whom we
have so many authentic, discourses. The position is much more favourable, for instance, than in the case of Socrates; for he is pictured to us
by literary men who exercised their creative ability upon the portrait.
Jesus stands much more immediately before us, because He was depicted
by simple Christians without literary gift.
<P>
But at this point there arises a twofold difficulty. There is first the fact
that what has just been said applies only to the first three Gospels, while
the fourth, as regards its character, historical data, and discourse material, forms a world of its own. It is written from the Greek standpoint,
while the first three are written from the Jewish. And even if one could
get over this, and regard, as has often been done, the Synoptics and the
Fourth Gospel as standing in something of the same relation to one another as Xenophon does to Plato as sources for the life of Socrates, yet
the complete irreconcilability of the historical data would compel the
critical investigator to decide from the first in favour of one source or
the other. Once more it is found true that "No man can serve two masters." This stringent dilemma was not recognised from the beginning;
its emergence is one of the results of the whole course of experiment.
<P>
The second difficulty regarding the sources is the want of any thread
<P>
<center>7</center>
<P>
of connexion in the material which they offer us. While the Synoptics
are only collections of anecdotes (in the best, historical sense of the
word), the Gospel of John — as stands on record in its closing words —
only professes to give a selection of the events and discourses.
<P>
From these materials we can only get a Life of Jesus with yawning
gaps. How are these gaps to be filled? At the worst with phrases, at the
best with historical imagination. There is really no other means of arriving at the order and inner connexion of the facts of the life of Jesus
than the making and testing of hypotheses. If the tradition preserved by
the Synoptists really includes all that happened during the time that
Jesus was with his disciples, the attempt to discover the connexion must
succeed sooner or later. It becomes more and more clear that this presupposition is indispensable to the investigation. If it is merely a fortuitous series of episodes that the Evangelists have handed down to us, we
may give up the attempt to arrive at a critical reconstruction of the life
of Jesus as hopeless.
<P>
But it is not only the events which lack historical connexion, we are
without any indication of a thread of connexion in the actions and discourses of Jesus, because the sources give no hint of the character of
His self-consciousness. They confine themselves to outward facts. We
only begin to understand these historically when we can mentally place
them in an intelligible connexion and conceive them as the acts of a
clearly defined personality. All that we know of the development of
Jesus and of His Messianic self-consciousness has been arrived at by a
series of working hypotheses. Our conclusions can only be considered
valid so long as they are not found incompatible with the recorded facts
as a whole.
<P>
It may be maintained by the aid of arguments drawn from the sources
that the self-consciousness of Jesus underwent a development during the
course of His public ministry; it may, with equally good grounds, be
denied. For in both cases the arguments are based upon little details in
the narrative in regard to which we do not know whether they are purely
accidental, or whether they belong to the essence of the facts. In each
case, moreover, the experimental working out of the hypothesis leads to
a conclusion which compels the rejection of some of the actual data of the
sources. Each view equally involves a violent treatment of the text.
<P>
Furthermore, the sources exhibit, each within itself, a striking contradiction. They assert that Jesus felt Himself to be the Messiah; and yet
from their presentation of His life it does not appear that He ever publicly claimed to be so. They attribute to Him, that is, an attitude which
has absolutely no connexion with the consciousness which they assume
that He possessed. But once admit that the outward acts are not the
natural expression of the self-consciousness and all exact historical
<P>
<center>8</center>
<P>
knowledge is at an end; we have to do with an isolated fact which is not
referable to any law.
<P>
This being so, the only way of arriving at a conclusion of any value
is to experiment, to test, by working them out, the two hypotheses — that
Jesus felt Himself to be the Messiah, as the sources assert, or that He did
not feel Himself to be so, as His conduct implies; or else to try to conjecture what kind of Messianic consciousness His must have been, if it
left His conduct and His discourses unaffected. For one thing is certain;
the whole account of the last days at Jerusalem would be unintelligible,
if we had to suppose that the mass of the people had a shadow of a suspicion that Jesus held Himself to be the Messiah.
<P>
Again, whereas in general a personality is to some extent defined by
the world of thought which it shares with its contemporaries, in the case
of Jesus this source of information is as unsatisfactory as the documents.
<P>
What was the nature of the contemporary Jewish world of thought?
To that question no clear answer can be given. We do not know whether
the expectation of the Messiah was generally current or whether it was
the faith of a mere sect. With the Mosaic religion as such it had nothing
to do. There was no organic connexion between the religion of legal observance and the future hope. Further, if the eschatological hope was
generally current, was it the prophetic or the apocalyptic form of that
hope? We know the Messianic expectations of the prophets; we know
the apocalyptic picture as drawn by Daniel, and, following him, by
Enoch and the Psalms of Solomon before the coming of Jesus, and by
the Apocalypses of Ezra and Baruch about the time of the destruction
of Jerusalem. But we do not know which was the popular form; nor,
supposing that both were combined into one picture, what this picture
really looked like. We know only the form of eschatology which meets
us in the Gospels and in the Pauline epistles; that is to say, the form
which it took in the Christian community in consequence of the coming
of Jesus. And to combine these three — the prophetic, the Late-Jewish
apocalyptic, and the Christian — has not proved possible.
<P>
Even supposing we could obtain more exact information regarding
the popular Messianic expectations at the time of Jesus, we should still
not know what form they assumed in the self-consciousness of One who
knew Himself to be the Messiah but held that the time was not yet come
for Him to reveal Himself as such. We only know their aspect from
without, as a waiting for the Messiah and the Messianic Age; we have no
clue to their aspect from within as factors in the Messianic self-consciousness. We possess no psychology of the Messiah. The Evangelists have
nothing to tell us about it, because Jesus told them nothing about it; the
sources for the contemporary spiritual life inform us only concerning
<P>
<center>9</center>
<P>
the eschatological expectation. For the form of the Messianic self-consciousness of Jesus we have to fall back upon conjecture.
<P>
Such is the character of the problem, and, as a consequence, historical experiment must here take the place of historical research. That
being so, it is easy to understand that to take a survey of the study of the
life of Jesus is to be confronted, at first sight, with a scene of the most
boundless confusion. A series of experiments are repeated with constantly varying modifications suggested by the results furnished by the
subsidiary sciences. Most of the writers, however, have no suspicion that
they are merely repeating an experiment which has often been made
before. Some of them discover this in the course of their work to their
own great astonishment — it is so, for instance, with Wrede, who recognises that he is working out, though doubtless with a clearer consciousness of his aim, an idea of Bruno Bauer's.[1] If old Reimarus were to come
back again, he might confidently give himself out to be the latest of the
moderns, for his work rests upon a recognition of the exclusive importance of eschatology, such as only recurs again in Johannes Weiss.
<P>
Progress, too, is curiously fitful, with long intervals of marking time
between the advances. From Strauss down to the 'nineties there was no
real progress, if one takes into consideration only the complete Lives of
Jesus which appeared. But a number of separate problems took a more
clearly defined form, so that in the end the general problem suddenly
moved forward, as it seemed, with a jerk.
<P>
There is really no common standard by which to judge the works with
which we have to do. It is not the most orderly narratives, those which
weave in conscientiously every detail of the text, which have advanced
the study of the subject, but precisely the eccentric ones, those that take
the greatest liberties with the text. It is not by the mass of facts that a
writer sets down alongside of one another as possible — because he
writes easily and there is no one there to contradict him, and because
facts on paper do not come into collision so sharply as they do in reality
— it is not in that way that he shows his power of reconstructing history,
but by that which he recognises as impossible. The constructions of
Reimarus and Bruno Bauer have no solidity; they are mere products of
the imagination. But there is much more historical power in their clear
grasp of a single definite problem, which has blinded them to all else,
than there is in the circumstantial works of Beyschlag and Bernard
Weiss.
<P>
But once one has accustomed oneself to look for certain definite landmarks amid this apparent welter of contusion one begins at last to dis-

cover in vague outline the course followed, and the progress made,
by the critical study of the life of Jesus.
<P>
It falls, immediately, into two periods, that before Strauss and that
after Strauss. The dominant interest in the first is the question of miracle. What terms are possible between a historical treatment and the
acceptance of supernatural events? With the advent of Strauss this problem found a solution, viz., that these events have no rightful place in the
history, but are simply mythical elements in the sources. The way was
thus thrown open. Meanwhile, alongside of the problem of the supernatural, other problems had been dimly apprehended. Reimarus had
drawn attention to the contemporary eschatological views; Hase, in his
first Life of Jesus (1829), had sought to trace a development in the self-consciousness of Jesus.
<P>
But on this point a clear view was impossible, because all the students
of the subject were still basing their operations upon the harmony of
the Synoptics and the Fourth Gospel; which means that they had not so
far felt the need of a historically intelligible outline of the life of Jesus.
Here, too, Strauss, was the lightbringer. But the transient illumination
was destined to be obscured by the Marcan hypothesis,[1] which now came
to the front. The necessity of choosing between John and the Synoptists
was first fully established by the Tubingen school; and the right relation
of this question to the Marcan hypothesis was subsequently shown by
Holtzmann.
<P>
While these discussions of the preliminary literary questions were in
progress the main historical problem of the life of Jesus was slowly
rising into view. The question began to be mooted: what was the significance of eschatology for the mind of Jesus? With this problem was
associated, in virtue of an inner connexion which was not at first suspected, the problem of the self-consciousness of Jesus. At the beginning of the 'nineties it was generally felt that, in the solution given to
this dual problem, and in some measure assured knowledge of the outward and inward course of the life of Jesus had been reached. At this
point Johannes Weiss revived the comprehensive claim of Reimarus on
behalf of eschatology; and scarcely had criticism adjusted its attitude
to this question when Wrede renewed the attempt of Bauer and Volkmar
to eliminate altogether the Messianic element from the life of Jesus.
<P>
We are now once more in the midst of a period of great activity in
the study of the subject. On the one side we are offered a historical solution, on the other a literary. The question at issue is: Is it possible to

[1] In the author's usage "the Marcan hypothesis" means the theory that the Gospel
of Mark is not only the earliest and most valuable source for the facts, but differs
from the other Gospels in embodying a more or less clear and historically intelligible
view of the connexion of events. See Chaps. X. and XIV. below.-TRANSLATOR.
<P>
<center>11</center>
<P>
explain the contradiction between the Messianic consciousness of Jesus
and His non-Messianic discourses and actions by means of a conception
of His Messianic consciousness which will make it appear that He could
not have acted otherwise than as the Evangelists describe; or must we
endeavour to explain the contradiction by taking the non-Messianic
discourses and actions as our fixed point, denying the reality of His
Messianic self-consciousness and regarding it as a later interpolation of
the beliefs of the Christian community into the life of Jesus? In the latter
case the Evangelists are supposed to have attributed these Messianic
claims to Jesus because the early Church held Him to be the Messiah,
but to have contradicted themselves by describing His life as it actually
was, viz., as the life of a prophet, not of one who held Himself to be
the Messiah. To put it briefly: Does the difficulty of explaining the
historical personality of Jesus lie in the history itself, or only in the way
in which it is represented in the sources?
<P>
This alternative will be discussed in all the critical studies of the next
few years. Once clearly posed it compels a decision. But no one can really
understand the problem who has not a clear notion of the way in which
it has shaped itself in the course of the investigation; no one can justly
criticise, or appraise the value of, new contributions to the study of this
subject unless he knows in what forms they have been presented before.
<P>
The history of the study of the life of Jesus has hitherto received surprisingly little attention. Hase, in his Life of Jesus of 1829, briefly
records the previous attempts to deal with the subject. Friedrich von
Ammon, himself one of the most distinguished students in this department, in his "Progress of Christianity," [l] gives some information regarding "the most notable biographies of Jesus of the last fifty years." In the
year 1865 Uhlhorn treated together the Lives of Jesus of Renan,
Schenkel, and Strauss; in 1876 Hase, in his "History of Jesus," gave the
only complete literary history of the subject; [2] in 1892 Uhlhorn extended
his former lecture to include the works of Keim, Deiff, Beyschlag, and
Weiss; [3] in 1898 Frentzen described, in a short essay, the progress of
the study since Strauss; [4] in 1899 and 1900 Baldensperger gave, in the
Theologische Rundschau, a survey of the most recent publications; [5]
Weinel's book, "Jesus in the Nineteenth Century," naturally only gives
an analysis of a few classical works; Otto Schmiedel's lecture on the

<P>
"Main Problems of the Critical Study of the Life of Jesus" (1902)
merely sketches the history of the subject in broad outline.[1]
<P>
Apart from scattered notices in histories of theology this is practically all the literature of the subject. There is room for an attempt to
bring order into the chaos of the Lives of Jesus. Hase made ingenious
comparisons between them, but he was unable to group them according
to inner principles, or to judge them justly. Weiss is for him a feebler
descendant of Strauss, Bruno Bauer is the victim of a fantastic imagination. It would indeed have been difficult for Hase to discover in the works
of his time any principle of division. But now, when the literary and
eschatological methods of solution have led to complementary results,
when the post-Straussian period of investigation seems to have reached
a provisional close, and the goal to which it has been tending has become
clear, the time seems ripe for the attempt to trace genetically in the successive works the shaping of the problem as it now confronts us, and to
give a systematic historical account of the critical study of the life of
Jesus. Our endeavour will be to furnish a graphic description of all the
attempts to deal with the subject; and not to dismiss them with stock
phrases or traditional labels, but to show clearly what they really did to
advance the formulation of the problem, whether their contemporaries
recognised it or not. In accordance with this principle many famous
Lives of Jesus which have prolonged an honoured existence through
many successive editions, will make but a poor figure, while others,
which have received scant notice, will appear great. Behind Success
comes Truth, and her reward is with her.
<P>
[1] Von Soden's study, <i>Die wichtigsten Fragen im Leben Jesu</i>, 1904, belongs here
only in a very limited sense, since it does not seek to show how the problems have
gradually emerged in the various Lives of Jesus.
