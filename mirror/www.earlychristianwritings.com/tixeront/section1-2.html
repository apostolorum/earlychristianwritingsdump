<P>
The name Apologists is given to a group of writers&#151;more especially of the second century&#151;who aimed to defend the Christians from the accusations brought against 
them, to obtain for them tolerance under the civil laws, and 
to demonstrate to their persecutors that the Christian religion is the only true one.
<P>
Christianity had scarcely begun to spread in the Roman 
world, when it found itself beset with vexations and persecutions of all kinds. The principal accusation made 
against Christians  was  that of  atheism (<font face="Symbol">aqeothV</font>). 
Contrary to the civil law, the Christians refused to adore 
the gods of the empire and practiced a religion not approved by the Roman Senate. In the eyes of the State, 
therefore, they were atheists, guilty of practicing a forbidden religion (<i>religio illicita</i>), and therefore enemies of the 
State and its fundamental institutions. To this charge were 
added base calumnies, which were soon circulated among the 
people and accepted even by a few eminent writers. One 
report was that, in their meetings, the Christians feasted 
upon the flesh of infants, previously slaughtered and then 
sprinkled with flour (<i>Epulae Thyesteae</i>); and were not 
ashamed of practicing such immoralities as the intercourse 
of Oedipus with his own mother. Intellectualists and politicians
<P>
[1] There exist two complete editions of the Greek apologists 
(except Aristides), that of D. Maran, reproduced in the <i>Patrologia 
Graeca</i>, VI; and that of J. C. Th. Otto, <i>Corpus Apologetarum 
Christianorum Saeculi Secundi</i>, Jena, 1847-1872. The five volumes 
devoted to St. Justin were published in a third edition in 1876-1881. 
The individual edition of each of the apologists will be pointed 
out under their name. See J. Martin, <i>L'Apologetique Traditionnelle</i>,
Paris, 1905. L. Laguier, <i>La Methode Apologetique des Peres 
dans les trois Premiers Siecles</i>, Paris, 1905; J. Riviere, <i>S. Justin 
et les Apologistes du Il' Siecle</i>, Paris, 1907. A. Puech, <i>Les Apologistes Grecs du Il' Siecle de Notre Ere</i>, Paris, 1912. 
<P>
<center>32</center>
<P>
accused them of indolence, <i>i. e.</i>; of shunning the world 
and business and taking no interest in the prosperity of the 
State, neglecting the affairs of this life for those of a 
future life. They were regarded as bad citizens and generally as a useless set of scoundrels.
<P>
The main effort of the Apologists was to refute these 
accusations and to show that Christianity had the right to 
exist. To attain this end, their work could not remain 
purely negative, but had to include a positive demonstration of the excellence and truth of the Christian religion. 
Such a demonstration necessarily involved them in an attack upon paganism, for a successful vindication of the 
superiority of Christianity demanded that a contrast be 
drawn between it and the State religion. The work of the 
Apologists, therefore, was not purely defensive; it was also 
controversial and expository.
<P>
The apologies were directed partly against the pagans and 
partly against the Jews. The former may be divided into 
three groups. Those of the <i>first group</i> take the form of 
requests or <i>petitions</i> addressed to the Emperor and to the 
Senate. The emperors of the Antonine dynasty were looked 
upon as just and moderate philosophers from whom philosophers like Justin and Athenagoras could hope to obtain 
a hearing. It is doubtful, however, whether or not these 
apologies addressed to the emperors were really brought to 
their notice. They were aimed at the public, though written 
in the form of open letters to the emperors. The apologies 
of the <i>second class</i> are addressed <i>directly to the people</i>. 
Such are, for example, the numerous <i>Discourses to the 
Greeks</i> of the second and third centuries. Lastly &#151; and 
these form the <i>third class</i>,&#151; a few apologies were addressed, 
at least primarily, to private individuals, e. g., the three 
books of Theophilus of Antioch to Autolycus and the 
<i>Epistle to Diognetus</i>.
<P>
Among the apologies against the Jews may be cited St. 
Justin's <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>. In these apologies the expository and demonstrative character predominates. The 
Jews harbored many prejudices which had to be removed, 
and a spirit of hatred which had to be overcome; indeed, 
they were not the last to spread popular calumnies against 
the Christians and denounce them to the authorities. But 
in the writings addressed to them the Apologists are less 
intent on refuting their accusations than on convincing them
<P>
<center>33</center>
<P>
of the divine mission of Jesus Christ and the truth of His 
religion. Consequently, their purpose was to demonstrate 
the Messiahship of Our Lord and for this demonstration 
they use mostly the argument from the prophecies, their 
thorough knowledge of the Sacred Scriptures proving very 
useful for this purpose.
<P>
From a literary point of view, the writings of the Apologists are generally superior to those of the Apostolic Fathers. Several of their authors had been trained in the 
schools and had studied philosophy: they gloried in the fact 
that they still remained philosophers, even though they had 
embraced Christianity. This may easily be seen from the 
vigor of their thought and reasoning. It is betrayed also 
by certain peculiarities of style, which often remind us of 
the sophists (professional grammarians and rhetoricians). 
Moreover, a number of these writings, at least, are fairly extensive and touch on the most important questions of moral 
and dogmatic theology. They are the first attempts at 
scientific theology made in the Church.

<h3>I. LOST APOLOGIES&#151;ARISTIDES OF ATHENS</h3>
<P>
We know of about twelve Apologists in the second century, but out of this number there are about five whose 
works have been entirely lost or from which we have only 
a few passages.
<P>
Among them is Quadratus (<font face="Symbol">KodratoV</font>),[1] whom certain critics have identified with the prophet of the same 
name spoken of by Eusebius.[2] He presented to the Emperor Hadrian (117-138) an apology which Eusebius had 
read and from which he quotes one sentence.[3]
<P>
To Aristo of Pella[4] we owe the first treatise against the 
Jews, written about 140, a <i>Disputation between Jason and 
Papiscus concerning Christ</i>. In this work, Jason, a Christian, with the help of the prophecies, proves against Papiscus, a Jew from Alexandria, that Jesus is the Son of God. 
This little work, defended by Origen against Celsus, was 
made use of (we know not to what extent) by later controversialists,

notably in the <i>Altercatio Simonis Judaei et 
Theophili Christiani</i>, brought to light by Evagrius.
<P>
Miltiades,[5] very probably from Asia Minor, wrote between 160 and 193. He composed three apologies, so Eusebius tells us,&#151; one <i>Against the Greeks</i>, a second <i>Against the 
Jews</i>, and a third "To the Princes of this World, an apology 
of the philosophy he followed."[6] Nothing remains of these 
writings.
<P>
The same may be said of Apollinaris,[7] bishop of Hierapolis
in Phrygia, who flourished in the time of Marcus 
Aurelius (161-180). We know through Eusebius that he 
was the author of an apology addressed to this emperor 
(probably in 172), five books <i>Against the Greeks</i>, two books 
<i>On Truth</i>, which appear also to be an apology, and two 
books <i>Against the Jews</i>.[8]
<P>
We may note, finally, the apology of Melito,[9] Bishop of 
Sardis, likewise addressed to Marcus Aurelius. Eusebius 
quotes three passages from it.[10] Melito is the author of 
another work, entitled <i>On Truth</i>,[11] also a defence of Christianity.
<P>
The <i>Oratio Melitonis philosophi quae habita est coram 
Antonio Caesare</i> has nothing to do with the Bishop of 
Sardis. Syriac seems to be the language in which this work 
was originally written. A recent opinion ascribes it to the 
Gnostic Bardesanes.
<P>
The earliest Apologist whose work we possess in its entirety,
is Aristides,[12] a philosopher of Athens, whom Eusebius names
immediately after Quadratus.[13] For a long time 
his apology was given up as lost, but it was found both in 
a Syriac version and in a revised Greek text of the legend 
of SS. Barlaam and Joasaph. We possess also a fragment 
in Armenian, but the Syriac text is the best of the three.
<P>
The contents of this apology are simple enough: the whole

<P>
question of the differences between pagans and Christians 
is reducible to the knowledge of the true God. God exists, 
for the existence and order of the world prove it. He must 
be eternal, impassible, and perfect. Now if we examine the 
beliefs of the four classes of men that make up humanity,&#151;the barbarians, the Greeks, the Jews, and the Christians,&#151; we find that the last mentioned alone have the right 
conception of God and of the worship due Him. The 
barbarians have worshipped as gods the elements and famous men (iii-vii). The Greeks have created gods who 
were slaves to passion. The Jews have certainly known 
the true God, but they have worshipped Him in a childlike 
way and have worshipped the Angels more than Him (xiv). 
The Christians alone know Him and serve Him with a pure 
conscience by leading a life worthy of Him (xv-xvi). 
Consequently, cease to persecute the Christians and be converted to their religion.
<P>
This treatise, evidently the work of an energetic man 
who was convinced of what he said, was addressed about 
140 to the Emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161).

<h3>2. ST. JUSTIN MARTYR[1]</h3>
<P>
One of the earliest and most eminent of the Apologists 
of the second century is St. Justin. Born between 100 
and 110 of heathen parents at Flavia Neapolis&#151;the modern Nablus and the ancient Sichem &#151; he felt at an early 
age a strong attraction for philosophy. He has himself 
given us a sketch of his intellectual and moral development 
(<i>Dial.</i> i-viii); artificial details may be discerned here and 
there, but the substance is certainly true. He received lessons
successively from a Stoic, a Peripatetic, and a Pythagorean,
but none satisfied him. Platonism seemed to afford
him some peace of mind; but a venerable old man, 
whose acquaintance he had made (probably at Ephesus), 
pointed out to him the insufficiency of philosophy and urged 
him to study the Scriptures and the teachings of Christ.
<P>
[1] Special edition of the two Apologies by L. Pautigny, Paris, 
1904, and of the <i>Dialogue with Tryphon</i> by G. Archambault, Paris, 
1009, in the <i>Textes et documents</i>. A. Bery, <i>Saint Justin, sa vie et 
sa doctrine</i>, Paris, 1901; M. J. Lagrange, <i>Saint Justin</i> (coll. <i>Les 
Saints</i>), Paris, 1914; L. Feder, <i>Justins des Martyrers Lehre von 
Jesus Christus</i>, Freiburg i. B., 1906.
<P>
<center>36</center>
<P>
Justin followed this advice and was converted about A. D., 
130.
<P>
As a Christian, he continued to wear the philosopher's 
mantle, leading the life of a lay missionary, preaching the 
doctrine of Christ and defending it as the highest and 
safest philosophy. Twice he came to Rome, where he spent 
a considerable time and founded a school which was quite 
successful. In the same city, most probably, he held, with 
Crescens, the cynic, the disputations which he mentions 
in his Second Apology. It is supposed that Crescens denounced
him and had him condemned, but there is nothing 
to prove this. Justin was beheaded in Rome with six other 
Christians, under Junius Rusticus, prefect of the city, between 163 and 167.
We have the authentic acts of his 
martyrdom.[2]
<P>
St. Justin was always admired for the earnestness of his 
convictions, the nobility of his character, and the perfect 
loyalty of his dealings. He was an apostle and a saint 
in the true sense of the words, filled with an ardent desire 
to do good to those whom he addressed. His reputation as 
a writer is not so high. Critics generally agree that his 
composition is defective. Instead of keeping to the point, 
he makes useless digressions and does not always conclude 
the arguments he has begun. His manner is monotonous, 
heavy, and often incorrect. The earnestness of the writer 
and the warmth of the discussion alone at times impart to 
his style <i>eclat</i> and life. From a theological point of view, 
however, the writings of St. Justin are exceptionally valuable.
Not only is he an undeniable witness of the important
dogmas of the Incarnation and the Holy Eucharist, 
but he is the first who carefully studied the relations between
faith and reason and who introduced the Greek categories
and a philosophical terminology into his doctrinal 
expositions. In this he is a true pioneer.
<P>
We are acquainted with the titles of nine or ten of St. 
Justin's authentic works: Eusebius mentions the two 
<i>Apologies</i>, a <i>Discourse against the Greeks</i>, <i>A Refutation 
against the Greeks</i>, a writing known as <i>De Monarchia Divina</i>,
another entitled <i>The Psalter</i>, a treatise <i>On the Soul</i>, 
written in the form of scholia, and the <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>.
<P>
St. Justin, on his part, speaks of a <i>Syntagma against all the</i>
<P>
[2] Otto, <i>Corpus Apologetarum</i>, III, p. 336 ff. 
<P>
[3] <i>H. E.</i>, iv, 18.
<P>
<center>37</center>
<P>
<i>Heresies</i> (<font face="Symbol">suntagma kata paswn twn gegenhmenwn</font>),[4] which
perhaps comprised the treatise <i>Against Marcion</i>, cited by St. 
Irenaeus.[5]
<P>
Apart from a few citations or fragments, only three of 
these works have reached us in a single manuscript, the 
<i>Codex Parisinus</i> 450, of the year 1364. They are the two 
<i>Apologies</i> and the <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>.
<P>
The <i>First Apology</i> is addressed to Antoninus Pius, Marcus
Aurelius, and Lucius Verus, to the Senate and the 
whole Roman people. Antoninus Pius reigned from 138 to 
161, but a number of indications in the text of the address 
lead us to conclude that it was written between 150 and 155. 
To all appearances it was written in Rome.
<P>
The plan which the author followed in his composition 
is not easy to trace, but critics generally admit a twofold 
category of considerations and proofs.
<P>
The "proposition" occupies ch. i-iii. The Christians 
must not be condemned if they are innocent of the crimes 
laid to their charge. That they are innocent Justin proves 
in two ways.
<P>
1. <i>By a direct refutation</i> (iv-xiii). The Christians are 
not atheists, although they do not adore idols; neither are 
they immoral, or homicides, or enemies of the Empire. 
They are virtuous and peaceful citizens.
<P>
2. This refutation alone would suffice; but it does not 
satisfy Justin. Convinced that Christianity is persecuted 
only because it is misapprehended, he devotes most of the 
remaining chapters of his <i>First Apology</i> to explaining to the 
pagans the Christian religion in its moral teaching (xvi-xvii),
in a few of its dogmas (xviii-xx), in its founder and 
its history (xxi-xxiii; xxx-lv), in its worship and the 
initiation of its adepts (lxi-lxvii).  xxiv-xxix and lvi-lx 
form two parentheses, in which the author returns to a 
subject he had previously treated, or speaks of the counterfeits
of Christianity set up by the demons. The conclusion
is contained in lxviii: St. Justin again demands that 
Christians be not condemned without examination and without trial.[8]
<P>
[4] <i>I Apol.</i>, xxvi, 8.
<P>
[5] <i>Adv. Haer.</i>, iv, 6, 2.
<P>
[6] The present text of the Apology gives after the conclusion a 
copy of the rescript of Hadrian to Minucius Fundanus. This rescript
seems to be authentic; but it may well be that it was not
placed there by St. Justin himself, at least in the first draft of the 
Apology. See C. Callewaert, <i>Le Rescrit d'Hadrien a Minucius 
Fundanus</i>, in the <i>Revue d'Histoire et de Litterature Religieuses</i>, 
VIII (1903), p. 152-189.
<P>
<center>38</center>
<P>
The <i>Second Apology</i> is addressed to the Senate. It is 
much shorter than the first and must have been written very 
soon after the latter (c. 155, at the latest), although it is 
in nowise a mere continuation of it. It was written in 
Rome on the following occasion. A Christian woman had 
separated from her pagan husband, a debauche, who, to 
avenge himself, denounced her catechist, Ptolemaeus, who 
was put to death with two other Christians by order of 
Urbicus, prefect of Rome (144-160). Justin immediately 
protested. The main idea of this new treatise is the same 
as that of the <i>First Apology</i>. The Christians are not 
known; their doctrine is purer, nobler, and more complete 
than those of the philosophers; their conduct is free from 
reproach. The demons are responsible for the fact that they 
are persecuted. All these ideas are jumbled together. 
But in reading the Apology, we feel that the author is 
aroused and foresees his own martyrdom; he awaits it, 
but this does not prevent him from proclaiming loudly that 
he is a Christian.
<P>
The third work of St. Justin which we possess is the 
<i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>. In this book it is no longer a question
of defending the Christians against their pagan persecutors;
but to convince the Jews of the Messiahship of 
Jesus Christ and the truth of His religion. Trypho is a 
learned rabbi, with whom Justin is supposed to have had 
a lengthy dispute at Ephesus, about 132-135, of which dispute
the <i>Dialogue</i> professes to be an exact reproduction. 
It cannot be said for certain whether the debate really 
took pace or whether St. Justin merely describes an imaginary
bout, to set forth his ideas. It is evident, however, 
that the arguments and retorts were not exactly those which 
St. Justin gives. We find in them, summarily, the various 
positions taken by St. Justin and the proofs he makes use 
of in his controversy with the Jews.
<P>
The text of the <i>Dialogue</i> has reached us in an imperfect 
state. In ch. lxxiv, 3, a considerable fragment has been lost, 
unnoticed by the copyist of the manuscript. It very probably
lacks also the dedication to a certain Marcus Pompeius,
<P>
<center>39</center>
<P>
who is not named till towards the end of the book (ch. cxli, 5).
<P>
According to St. Justin himself (lxxxv, 4), the disputation
with Trypho lasted two days, and the Dialogue was accordingly
divided into two parts. The transition between 
these two parts was made in the lost ch. lxxiv. This remark
of the author, however, by no means gives us the 
logical division of the treatise, for on the second day Justin 
repeats a number of things he had said the day before. 
The absence of all order from his composition renders it as 
difficult to determine the logical division in the <i>Dialogue</i> as 
in the <i>Apologies</i>. All we can say is that, after describing 
his conversion in the introduction (i-viii), Justin develops 
three principal ideas: 1. the decline of the old Covenant and 
its precepts; 2. the identity of the Logos with the God who 
appeared in the Old Testament, spoke to the patriarchs and 
prophets and, last of all, became incarnate in the virgin 
Mary; and 3. the calling of the Gentiles as the true people 
of God. According to Otto, the first idea is developed in 
chs. x-xlvii; the second in chs. xlviii-cviii, and the third in 
chs. cix-cxiii. Other authors propose other divisions.
<P>
As we have said, the disputation with Trypho must have 
taken place&#151;if it took place at all&#151;at Ephesus[7] during 
the war of Bar-Cocheba in I32-I35.[8] However, the <i>Dialogue</i>
itself, which reproduces the disputation, is subsequent
to the first Apology.[8] Critics are generally agreed 
in placing the date of composition between 155-161. Where 
it was written is not known.
<P>
The <i>Apologies</i> and the <i>Dialogue</i> constitute the essential 
part of St. Justin's authentic works. Of somewhat less 
value are four fragments&#151;the first of which is quite 
lengthy&#151;concerning a treatise <i>On the Resurrection</i>
ascribed to Justin by Procopius of Gaza and St. John 
Damascene.[10] Whatever may be said concerning the authenticity
of this treatise, it is certainly very ancient, since 
Methodius of Olympus seems to allude to it at the end of 
the third century. Harnack places it between the years 150 
and 180.
<P>
We must regard as spurious three treatises, bearing titles

identical with, or similar to, the titles of treatises of Justin, 
mentioned by Eusebius and falsely attributed to the Saint. 
These are the <i>Oratio ad Gentes</i>, the <i>Cohortatio ad Gentiles</i>, 
and the <i>De Monarchia</i>.[11] The <i>Oratio</i> and perhaps also the 
<i>De Monarchia</i> belong to the second century; the <i>Cohortatio</i>
to the second half of the third.
<P>
The six treatises which follow in the complete editions of 
St. Justin[12] have still less right to be there. The <i>Epistula 
ad Zenam et Serenum</i> is an exhortation addressed, it seems, 
to monks and ascetics. According to a conjecture of Batiffol,
it was written by Sisinnius,[13] the Novatian bishop of 
Constantinople (c. 400). The other five&#151;<i>Expositio 
Rectae Fidei</i>,[14] <i>Confutatio Dogmatum Quornndam . . ., 
Responsiones ad Orthodoxos . . ., Quaestlones Christianorum . . .</i>, and <i>Quaestiones Centllium</i>&#151;have been 
ascribed by Harnack to Diodorus of Tarsus (d. 391-392). 
According to Funk, the <i>Expositio</i> belongs to the fifth century
and the Responsiones should be ascribed to Theodoret. 
It seems certain that the three or four last treatises are the 
work of one and the same author.

<a name="#tatian"> </a>

<h3>3. TATIAN[1]</h3>
<P>
Tatian was born of heathen parents, probably in 120, in 
Assyria, <i>i. e.</i>, in the country situated beyond the river Tigris. 
He received a Greek education, studied history, rhetoric 
and philosophy, and became a sophist, travelling from city 
to city to deliver his speeches and give his lessons in ethics. 
He studied many different religions and was initiated into 
several mystery cults, but nowhere found satisfaction. It 
was in reading the Scriptures that he found the light he was 
seeking, and so became a Christian.[2]
<P>
His conversion occurred probably in Rome. Almost immediately
he became a "hearer" and disciple of St. Justin

and, like him, was pursued by Crescens,[3] c. 155-160. Eusebius
tells us that Tatian opened a school in Rome and that 
Rhodon was one of his disciples.[4] It is not known whether 
this took place before or after the death of St. Justin. In 
either case, Tatian did not remain faithful to the teaching 
of his master: he abandoned the Church in the twelfth year 
of Marcus Aurelius. Eusebius and St. Epiphanius say 
that he founded the sect of the Encratites. According to 
Irenaeus he denied that Adam was saved, condemned marriage
as fornication, and believed in a series of eons.
<P>
Tatian had probably left Rome by this time. He withdrew
into Mesopotamia, the land of his birth, and there spent 
the last days of his life. We do not know the date of his
death.
<P>
A comparison has often been drawn between the character
and disposition of Tatian and that of Tertullian. This 
comparison is justified because, although Tatian has not the
genius of Tertullian, they are both excessive, violent, and
fond of paradox. Instead of trying to conciliate his opponents
in order to win them over, Tatian repulses them
by invective and sarcasm. He can find no good in them:
Greek art is immoral, Greek literature childish, Greek philosophy
false, the Greek language neither pure nor uniform.
From beginning to end his is an apology of the clenched 
fist. Each line betrays arrogance and bitterness.
<P>
From a literary point of view, the Apology of Tatian&#151; 
the only work of his that is entirely preserved&#151;is extremely
obscure and difficult to interpret. This obscurity is 
due partly, no doubt, to the imperfect condition of the text, 
but partly also to the author's style. Tatian had been a 
sophist and retained the affected style of a sophist, seeking 
for new figures and sensational phrases. This does not 
prevent him from sometimes being careless and trivial. 
Although he loses sight of his subject less often than St. 
Justin, he allows himself to drift into digressions, which 
interrupt the trend of his discourse. What we most admire 
in him is the brilliance, the sincerity, and the enthusiasm 
of the controversialist. "Tatian," concludes Puech, " . . . 
sometimes offends by his negligence, sometimes by his affectation,
but it would be too severe a judgment to call him 
a barbarian; ... he is a pretentious but able writer."
<P>
We know from Tatian himself that he composed a work

[3] <i>Or.</i> 19.
<P>
[4] <i>H. E.</i>, v, 13, i, 8.
<P>
<center>42</center>
<P>
<i>On Animals</i> or <i>On Living Beings</i> (<font face="Symbol">peri zwwn</font>),[5] and perhaps 
another in which he treated of the nature of demons.[6] He 
intended to write "Against Those who have Treated of 
Divine Things," <i>i. e.</i>, against the pagan theologians.[7] Rhodon,
a disciple of Tatian, mentions a "Book of Problems,"[8]
probably a collection of obscure passages in the Scriptures. 
Clement of Alexandria refers to a work of Tatian "On Perfection
according to the Precepts of the Savior," which forbids
marriage.[9] The only two writings of Tatian we can 
read to-day are the <i>Discourse to the Greeks</i> (<font face="Symbol">LogoV proV </font>'<font face="Symbol">EllhnaV</font>), preserved entire, and the <i>Diatessaron</i>, which has 
been partly reconstructed.
<P>
The Discourse was not composed at Rome, but more 
likely at Antioch, for the author addresses native Greeks, 
and not merely Greek-speaking persons.[10] It was probably
written after the death of St. Justin,[11] but before the 
author's break with the Church, c. 172-173. The date of 
its composition must be placed between 165 and i73.[12] It 
was evidently intended for wide circulation.
<P>
The work is divided into three parts: (1) an introduction 
(1-4) in which Tatian begs the Greeks not to deal too 
rigorously with the barbarians (<i>i. e.</i>, Christians), who are in 
fact superior to them; (2) an exposition of the principal 
Christian teachings (5-30) concerning the Logos, the Resurrection,
the Angels and demons, the soul, the spirit, the 
world, etc., compared with the religious and philosophical 
teachings of the Greeks and in particular with their mythology:
the superiority of the former is more than evident;
(3) a chronological discussion (31-41). Not only is the 
Christian doctrine superior to the pagan teachings; it is 
more ancient. Moses lived 400 years before the Trojan 
War celebrated by Homer,&#151; lived even before the sages 
who preceded this poet. Chs. 33 and 34 contain what 
is called the <i>Catalogue of Statues</i>. It is an enumeration of 
the Greek sculptures Tatian had seen in Rome,&#151; interesting
for the history of art. In a short conclusion the Apologist

reaffirms his faith and his intention to persevere in it.
<P>
Tatian's other work, of which only fragments remain, is 
the <i>Diatessaron</i>[13] (<font face="Symbol">To dia tessawn euaggelion</font>). It is a 
Gospel-harmony compiled from the four Gospels with 
the texts arranged in such a way as to give a chronological
exposition of the life and teachings of Christ. This 
work was originally written in Syriac and must be assigned 
to a date subsequent to Tatian's return to the East (c. 172). 
Up to the fifth century it was very popular throughout the 
Christian churches of Syria, which adopted it for their 
liturgical services. It is quoted by Aphraates and commented
upon by St. Ephraem.
<P>
We have not the complete text, but it has been possible 
partly to reconstruct it by means of an Armenian translation
of St. Ephraem's commentary and with the help of a 
later revision of the Gospel-harmony in Arabic, and of 
another in Latin, both of which have preserved the plan of 
composition of the original Diatessaron.

<a name="#athenagoras"> </a>

<h3>4. ATHENAGORAS[1]</h3>
<P>
Athenagoras is mentioned neither by Eusebius nor by 
St. Jerome, and we know very little about him. He was an 
Athenian philosopher, though perhaps not born in Athens. 
According to a sketch in the Christian History of Philip of 
Side, who wrote c. 430, he was at first a heathen, and became
a Christian by reading the Scriptures. Perhaps he 
lived for a time in Alexandria.
<P>
We can get an idea of his character and methods from 
what writings of his have come down to us. He is a philosopher
in every sense of the term. His primary object 
is to instruct and to demonstrate. Whilst Justin is an 
apostle, and Tatian a polemist, Athenagoras is a professor 
who discourses according to all the rules of grammar and

logic. His composition is as lucid and orderly as that of 
Justin and Tatian is loose and careless. He never for a 
moment strays from his subject; he makes no display of 
rhetoric or figurative language. In all his writings we meet 
with forcible reasoning and a powerful style, so concise 
that it borders at times on dryness, truly the style of a 
philosopher. Strange to say, this convinced Christian, in 
writing against the pagans on the resurrection of bodies, 
draws no proof for this dogma from revelation and the 
Scriptures.
<P>
We have two of Athenagoras' works: an apology and a 
treatise <i>On the Resurrection of Bodies</i>.
<P>
1. The apology is entitled <i>Supplication for the Christians</i> 
(<font face="Symbol">peri cristianwn</font>). It was addressed to the Emperors Marcus 
Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus. The 
titles given to Marcus Aurelius and to Commodus, as well 
as the reference, in the first chapter, to the profound peace 
then prevailing, enable us to fix the date of the composition 
of this work between December A. D. 176, and the first 
months of 178. The work was undoubtedly written at 
Athens.
<P>
The arrangement of ideas is most lucid. After soliciting 
the attention of the Emperors, Athenagoras enumerates the 
three chief accusations current against the Christians:
atheism, immorality and anthropophagy (1-3). He refutes 
these three calumnies successively. The Christians are not 
atheists: they adore one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 
It is true they do not offer any bloody sacrifices, nor do they 
worship the pagan gods; but the true God has no need of 
such crude sacrifices, and the gods of paganism are no gods 
at all, but men who have been deified (4-30).
<P>
The second accusation, that of immorality, is equally without
foundation. Christians profess belief in the torments 
of hell; they condemn even the thought of evil. The pagans 
themselves commit the atrocities of which they accuse the 
Christians (31-34).
<P>
With regard to the Thyestean banquets, Christians are in 
no way guilty of such crimes, but hate homicide, avoid the 
gladiatorial fights, condemn the exposure of children, and 
believe in the resurrection of bodies (35-36).
<P>
He concludes with an appeal to the justice and clemency 
of the Emperors (37).
<P>
2. In ch. 36 of his apology, Athenagoras promised a discussion
<P>
<center>45</center>
<P>
of the doctrine of the resurrection. This work 
must have followed very closely upon the former, and was 
perhaps written in 178 or 179. Certain details in chs. 1, 
19, 23, and the order of ideas followed still more rigorously 
than in the apology, favor the opinion that it was a lecture 
or conference, first delivered orally and later circulated 
in written form.
<P>
The lecture is divided into two parts: (l) a refutation 
of the objections brought against the possibility of the resur- 
rection (1-10), and (2) a demonstration of it as a fact 
(11-25). In the first part the author proves that there is 
nothing in the resurrection of bodies above the power of 
God and contrary to His attributes. In the second he emphasizes
more especially the unity of the human person, 
concluding that the eternal life and happiness, which are 
the end of man, are for his body as much as for his soul, 
and that the body which participates in the good and bad 
actions of the soul, must be punished or rewarded with it. 
This cannot take place without the resurrection.
<P>

<a name="#theophilus"> </a>

<h3>5. THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH[l]</h3>
<P>
Theophilus came from that part of Syria which borders 
on Mesopotamia. He was born a pagan and was converted
to Christianity by meditating on the Scriptures. Towards
the year 169, he succeeded Cornelius as bishop of 
Antioch. Eusebius places the end of his episcopate in 
177; most probably it lasted until 182 or 183, for the books 
<i>To. Autolycus</i> were not completed until after the death of 
Marcus Aurelius (Mar. 17, 180).
<P>
Theophilus received a Greek education and seems to have 
had some knowledge of Hebrew. He is inferior to Justin 
and Athenagoras in depth of philosophical thought, but surpasses
them in extent and variety of literary culture. His 
style is lively, imaginative, and original; his diction, elegant 
and ornate. He was well read, but his reading had not 
stifled personal reflection and judgment.
<P>
Besides the <i>Apology to Aulolycus</i>, which we shall examine
presently, Theophilus wrote a work, in at least two 
books, upon the origin of mankind according to the Bible 
and mythology (cf. <i>Ad Autolyc.</i>, ii, 28, 30, 31, iii, 3, 19).
<P>
[1] Text in Otto, <i>Corp. Apolog.</i>, VIII. See Freppel, <i>Les Apologistes 
Chretiens au Il' siecle</i>, 2nd series, Paris, 3rd edit., 1888.
<P>
<center>46</center>
<P>
Eusebius mentions other writings of his,&#151;a work against 
the heresy of Hermogenes, another against Marcion, and a 
few books for the instruction and edification of the faithful.[2]
St. Jerome mentions a Commentary on the Book of 
Proverbs and Commentaries on the Gospel.[3] Of all these 
works, there remain but the fragments of the Commentaries 
cited by St. Jerome.
<P>
We have in full, however, the three books To Autolycus. 
Autolycus was a learned heathen, who seems to have been 
a magistrate. The three Discourses (<font face="Symbol">logoi</font>) addressed to 
him by Theophilus are not, properly speaking, parts of the 
same work, but three distinct treatises which have been 
joined together. This was done because there is a real connection
among them: they are addressed to the same person 
and deal with almost the same topics.
<P>
The first book contains fourteen chapters and was written
apropos of a conversation with Autolycus, who had 
asked Theophilus to show him his God, had praised the 
gods of paganism and scoffed at the name of Christian. 
Theophilus treats of the nature of the true God, who is 
invisible to the eyes of the body, but whose existence is 
known to us, and whom we shall contemplate as He is when 
we shall be clothed in incorruptibility. He denounces the 
gods of paganism and extols the Christians.
<P>
The second book contains thirty-eight chapters. It reverts
to the thoughts previously expressed in order to develop
them more fully. In the first part (2-8) the author 
exposes the insufficiency and childishness of the pagan 
teachings. In the second part (9-38) he contrasts these 
teachings with those of Holy Scripture concerning the origin 
of the world, the worship due to God, and the moral life 
man should lead.
<P>
The third book contains thirty chapters and is an answer 
to an objection of Autolycus. "Your religion," he says, "is 
new, and your Scriptures are recent writings." The first 
fifteen chapters show the futility of the accusations brought 
against Christians concerning immorality and anthropophagy.
In ch. 16 he takes up the chronological discussion 
and gives a resume of Jewish history. He concludes that 
Moses must have lived from 900 to 1000 years before the 
Trojan War. He counts 5695 years from the beginning 
of the world to the death of Marcus Aurelius.

<P>
From the fact that the author ends his calculation with 
Aurelius' death we conclude that the third book to Autolycus
was written in the first years of the reign of the 
Emperor Commodus (c. 180-182). As the three books followed
very closely upon one another, we may assume that 
the entire work was written approximately between 178 
and 182.

<a name="#diognetus"> </a>

<h3>6. THE LETTER TO DIOGNETUS[1]</h3>
<P>
Not a single ancient writer mentions the <i>Letter to Diognetus</i>.
The only manuscript which contained it &#151; destroyed in 1870 &#151; attributed
it to St. Justin, but the letter 
is certainly not from his pen. As we lack all evidence 
from other extrinsic sources, we can only make more or 
less probable conjectures concerning its authorship. The 
epistolary form given to this small work may be only a 
literary fiction.
<P>
We are limited to conjectures based on internal evidence. 
The letter comprises ten chapters.[2] Diognetus had asked 
the author why the Christians neither adore the pagan gods 
nor practice the Jewish worship, what life they lead and 
why Christianity appeared so late in the world. The author 
answers these questions in due order.  1. The Christians do 
not adore the gods of the heathen because these gods are 
nothing more than wood, stone, or metal. 2. Neither do 
they imitate the worship of the Jews, because, although this 
worship is rendered to God, it is childish and unworthy of 
Him. 3. There follows an ideal description of the Christian 
way of living. The Christians are to the world what the 
soul is to the body,&#151; a superior and life-giving principle 
(5-7). 4. That Christianity has appeared so late, is because 
God wished to make men conscious of their weakness and 
corruption before sending them the Redeemer (8-9). The 
conclusion is an exhortation to conversion (10).
<P>
The <i>Letter to Diognetus</i> is one of the most perfect literary
compositions handed down to us from ancient 
Christian times. The author is as sympathetic and well-meaning

Epistle to Diognetus</i>, London, 1908.

meaning as St. Justin, but he is a better writer. With 
soundness of doctrine and loftiness of thought he combines 
the gift of developing his ideas in a clear, harmonious, and 
progressive manner and of putting into his exposition force 
and life without breaking the thread of his theme. He 
was evidently a man of breadth and culture.
<P>
The <i>Letter</i> belongs to a period after the first and before 
the fourth century; this is sufficiently proved by the mention 
the author makes of present persecutions (5, 6). Renan, 
Zahn, and Harnack would place it in the third century;
Kihn, Kruger, and Bardenhewer, in the second. The last-named
author takes this view because Christianity is represented
in the Letter as a recent foundation and depicted in 
its first fervor.

<h3>7. HERMIAS[1]</h3>
<P>
<i>The Mockery of Heathen Philosophers</i> (<font face="Symbol">DiasurgoV twn ezw filosofwn</font>) by Hermias, the philosopher, in 10 chapters, 
is entirely different from the <i>Letter to Diognetus</i>. The 
author wishes to show that the heathen philosophers are not 
in agreement, nay hold contradictory opinions concerning 
the nature of the soul (1-2) and the first principle of all 
things (3-10). He proves this by placing under the reader's
eye the principal philosophers and their schools of 
thought, calling attention to the solutions they have given to 
the above problems.
<P>
This treatise is very superficial and all but worthless. 
It is not an apology, but a light and bantering satire 
(<font face="Symbol">diasurgoV</font>) that is of no value since the philosophical systems
ridiculed by the author are neither studied nor criticized.
<P>
We do not know who Hermias was. The author and 
his work are never mentioned by ancient writers. A few 
critics (Diels, Wendland, Harnack) assign the composition 
to the fifth or sixth century, when paganism was no longer 
popular. Bardenhewer places it in the third century, on 
the ground that Hermias seems to know nothing of Neo-Platonism.

<h3>8. MINUCIUS FELIX[1]</h3>
<P>
One of the best apologies of the period from the second 
to the third century, and one of the most ancient productions 
of Latin Christian literature, is the <i>Octavius</i> of Minucius
Felix.
<P>
The <i>Octavius</i> is a dialogue divided into four parts.
<P>
1. It opens with an introduction (1-4) in which the 
characters appear upon the scene. The author, who calls 
himself Marcus, wishes to tell how his friend Octavius succeeded
in winning over to Christianity the pagan Caecilius 
Natalis. One day these three were enjoying a walk by the 
sea, near Ostia, when they passed before a statue of Serapis. 
Caecilius salutes the statue and the act starts a discussion 
of the religious question. They determine to thresh out 
the question thoroughly, and Marcus is constituted arbiter of 
the controversy between Caecilius and Octavius.
<P>
2. The second part (5-13) is taken up almost entirely by 
a speech of Caecilius. In this speech we may distinguish 
three leading ideas:

a) <i>A philosophical development</i>. Truth is inaccessible:
we know nothing about the gods, who, at any rate, are little 
concerned with men. Hence, in matters of religion it is 
wiser to follow the laws of one's own country.
<P>
b) <i>An attack upon Christianity</i>. The Christians do not 
follow these laws: they form a secret society, immoral and 
criminal, the enemy of all mankind. Moreover, their worship
is absurd, since they adore a crucified man.
<P>
c) <i>Conclusion</i>. Away with all religious innovations: let 
things remain as they are.
<P>
3. In the third part (14-38) Octavius closely follows the 
arguments of his opponent and refutes them one by one. 
We can know God: reason proves the existence of one God 
and of a Providence. Polytheism originated from a suggestion
of the demons; they are the ones who spread against 
the Christians the calumnies mentioned by Caecilius. The 
Christians are pure in all their ways; their beliefs and their 
worship are reasonable and, in spite of persecutions, they

Louvain, 1903, with French translation and commentary. French 
translation by F. Record, Paris, 1911. See P. de Felice, <i>Etude sur 
l'Octavius de Min. Felix</i>, Blois, 1880; Gaston Boissier, <i>La Fin du 
Paganisme</i>, Paris, 1891, tome I; P. Monceaux, <i>Hist. Litter. de

find in the testimony of a good conscience a peace and 
happiness no one can take away. Things must not be allowed
to remain as they are: "Cohibeatur superstitio, 
impietas expietur, vera religio reservetur."
<P>
4. The fourth part (39-41) is the conclusion: Caecilius 
admits his defeat and becomes a Christian.
<P>
Critics are of one accord in declaring the Octavius to be 
the masterpiece of an able writer who, though possessed of 
very few original ideas, treated his subject in classic literary
form. The dialogue has artistic freshness and beauty;
the life and emotion that pervade it are never expressed in 
terms that are too violent. It is evidently modelled on 
Cicero's <i>De Natura Deorum</i> and <i>De Divinations</i>, as well 
as on Seneca's <i>De Providentia</i> and <i>De Superstitions</i>. The 
author wished to offer to educated pagans a defence of 
Christianity that would be acceptable to them, clothed as it 
was in a literary form which they relished. Hence his care 
to set aside in this exposition of the Christian religion everything
mysterious or obscure for human reason and to bring 
into bold relief instead the lofty spiritual and moral teaching of the new faith.
<P>
The author of the Octavius calls himself, as we have already
said, Marcus (3, 5). Lactantius and St. Jerome give 
us his full name, Marcus Minucius Felix. He was a distinguished
lawyer, probably of African extraction, who lived 
in Rome and who, in his later years, passed from Stoicism to 
Christianity (1). The hero of the dialogue, Octavius Janu- 
arius, was also a convert, but he was dead when the book was 
written (1). As to his pagan friend, Caecilius Natalis, he 
too lived in Rome, although he seems to have come from 
Cirta (9,31). An inscription has been found there relating
to a certain Marcus Caecilius Quinti films Quirina 
Natalis, who was a triumvir under Caracalla (211-217).
<P>
The <i>Octavius</i> was certainly written after the year 175, 
because Fronto, who is spoken of as being dead or, at least, 
as a very old man (9, 31), died shortly after 175. A more 
precise dating of the composition would depend upon the 
opinion adopted concerning the relations of the Octavius 
with the <i>Apologeticum</i> of Tertullian. It is certain that 
one of the two authors knew and borrowed from the other. 
The <i>Apologeticum</i> dates from the year 197, and if its author 
made use of the Octavius, the latter must be placed between
175-197. If, on the contrary, the author of the <i>Octavius</i>
<P>
<center>51</center>
<P>
used the <i>Apologeticum</i>, the former work must be 
posterior to 197 and must be placed at the end of the second 
or in the first half of the third century. This question is 
one of those upon which most critics are divided. Muralt, 
Ebert, Schwenke, and others uphold the priority of the 
Octavius; Massebieau, Harnack, and Monceaux, that of the 
<i>Apologeticum</i>. According to the latter group, the Octavius
must be placed between 197 and 250.
