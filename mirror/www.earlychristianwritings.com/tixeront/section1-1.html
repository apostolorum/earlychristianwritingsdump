<P>
"Apostolic Fathers" is the name given to a certain number of writers or writings (several of which are anonymous)
dating from the end of the first or from the first half of the
second century. The name has been selected because the
authors are supposed to have known the Apostles and also
because their works represent a teaching derived immediately, or almost immediately, from the Apostles. These
writings are, indeed, a continuation of the Gospels and of
Apostolic literature.
<P>
On the other hand, these works have neither the intense
vividness of the canonical books nor the fullness of theological thought found in the literature of a later period.
With the exception of St. Ignatius, their authors do not
show much intellectual power or ability, which goes to prove
that, in the beginning, the Church recruited her members
chiefly from among the illiterate. Nevertheless, the writings of these men are of great value to us, both on account of their antiquity and because they show how the
Christians of the second and third generations understood
the work of Christ and of his Apostles.
<P>
There are about ten Apostolic Fathers. One-half of their
writings is made up of epistles (Clement, Ignatius, Polycarp, Pseudo-Barnabas) ; the other half comprises doctrinal, parenetic or disciplinary treatises (The <i>Didache</i>, the
"Secunda Clementis," the <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i>, Papias,
<i>The Apostles' Creed</i>).[1]
<P>
[1] The edition of the Apostolic Fathers by Migne (P. G., I, II, V)
is insufficient. The student must use that of F. X. Funk, <i>Patres
Apostolici</i>, Tubingae, 1901, in 2 vols., with Latin translation and
notes (the second vol. revised and reedited by F. Diekamp, 1913),
or separate editions of the collection of Hemmes and Lejay indicated below.
Cf. also the minor editions (without translation or
notes) of Funk and Harnack, Gebhardt and Zahn. See Freppel,
<i>Les Peres Apostoliques et leur Epoque</i>, Paris, 4th ed., 1885.

<h3>I. St. Clement[2]</h3>
<P>
According to the most trustworthy tradition, St. Clement
was the third successor of St. Peter and the fourth bishop
of Rome. Nothing warrants our identifying him with the
Clement of whom St. Paul speaks when writing to the
Philippians[3] and still less with Flavius Clemens, a
consul, cousin of the Emperor Domitian, who was
beheaded in 95 or 96. St. Clement probably knew the
Apostles. He was presumably a freedman, or the son
of a freedman, of the <i>gens</i> Flavia, whence he derived
his name. Be this as it may, Clement was certainly
in some respects a remarkable pontiff, since he made
a profound impression on the early Church. Two "Letters
to Virgins," two "Letters to James," the brother of the
Lord, and a collection of Homilies are ascribed to him, besides the so-called "Second Letter to the Corinthians"; he
is also given a prominent part in the romance of the "<i>Recognitions</i>."
<P>
At the end of the IVth century Rome honored him as a
martyr; the alleged acts of his martyrdom, however, are not
authentic, but belong to another Clement, a Greek martyr
buried at Cherson.
<P>
Of Pope St. Clement we possess only one authentic writing, the <i>Epistle to the Corinthians </i> (<i>Epistola Prima Clementis</i>). It is contained in two Greek MS., the "<i>Alexandrinus</i>," probably belonging to the IVth century (now in
the British Museum), and the "<i>Constantinopolitanus</i>" or,
better, "<i>Hierosolymitanus</i>," dating from 1056 (kept in Jerusalem). In the former manuscript chapters Ivii, 6-lxiii, 4
are missing; the latter is complete. There exist, furthermore, a very literal Latin version, which seems to go back

to the IInd century,[4] a Syriac version,[5] and two incomplete
Coptic versions.[6]
<P>
This epistle is anonymous. It introduces itself as a letter
from "the Church of God which is in Rome to the Church
of God which is in Corinth." Although the letter is written in the name of a community, it is undoubtedly the work
of an individual and this individual is Clement. Denis of
Corinth (170-175?) gives us decisive proof of this, and it
would be difficult to find anyone in a position to be better
informed than he was.[7] To his testimony we may add those
of Hegesippus,[8] of Clement of Alexandria, and of St.
Irenaeus.[9] St. Polycarp was certainly acquainted with this
epistle, since he made it the pattern of his own to the
Philippians, and this circumstance alone is sufficient proof
that the letter dates back approximately to the time of St.
Clement.
<P>
Clement's pontificate is to be placed between the years 92
and 101. His letter was written after a persecution which
appears to be that of Domitian. As this persecution ended
in 95 or 96, Clement must have written to the Corinthians
between the years 95 and 98.
<P>
The occasion was a schism which had broken out in the
Church of Corinth. One or two ringleaders[10] had stirred
up the faithful against the presbyters, of whom several, of
irreproachable life, had driven them from office. We are
ignorant of the nature of the accusation raised against them.
The Church of Rome learned of these troubles through
public rumor, for notwithstanding what is said in ch. I, 1, it
does not seem probable that the Church of Rome was informed and asked to intervene by the Church of Corinth.
Clement, as pope, intervened for the purpose of restoring
peace and pointing out means of remedying the trouble.
<P>
The Epistle is divided into two main parts. The first is
general (iv-xxxviii) and contains a series of exhortations to

the practice of charity, penance, obedience, humility, faith,
etc., calculated to insure a spirit of concord among the faithful. The train of thought is interrupted (xxiii-xxx) by a
lengthy parenthesis on the certainty of the future resurrection. The second part (xxxix-lix) deals more directly with
the troubles at Corinth. God, says Clement, established the
ecclesiastical hierarchy and sent Christ. Christ appointed
the Apostles, who appointed bishops and deacons, who in
turn, as the necessity arose, chose other men to succeed them.
To these men the faithful owe submission and obedience,
and this is why they who drove the presbyters from office
have sinned. They must do penance and withdraw for a
time from Corinth, in order that peace may be re-established. Then follows a long prayer (lix, -3 lxi), in which
praises to God and supplications for the Christians and for
the authorities succeed one another. The letter concludes
with fresh exhortations to unity and with spiritual good
wishes (Ixii-lxv).
<P>
In the early Church the Epistle of St. Clement was held
in the greatest esteem. Some authors even went so far as
to rank it with the inspired writings. St. Irenaeus calls it
"very powerful"; Eusebius pronounces it "grand and admirable" and testifies to the fact that in several churches
it was read publicly at the meetings of the faithful.[11] The
letter is worthy of such esteem because of the happy blending of firmness and kindness which characterizes it, and the
shrewdness of observation, delicacy of touch and lofty sentiments which the author manifests throughout. The great
prayer at the conclusion has a majestic swing. Unfortunately, the abuse of Old Testament quotations, especially in
the first part, often interferes with the development of the
author's thought and prevents it from attaining its highest
flight.
<P>
From a theological point of view the Epistle of St.
Clement is of great importance. It marks the "epiphany of
the Roman primacy," being the first manifestation of the
consciousness of this prerogative in Rome. It also contains
the first patristic affirmation of the divine right of the hierarchy.[12]

<h3>2. ST. IGNATIUS[1]</h3>
<P>
St. Ignatius, also callel Theophorus, according to tradition succeeded Evodius, the first bishop of Antioch after St.
Peter.[2] Nothing is known for certain of his youth or even
of his episcopate. It is surmised that he was born a pagan
and became converted to the faith later in life.
<P>
He was bishop of Antioch[3] when a persecution, the cause
of which is unknown to us, broke out. St. Ignatius was its
noblest and perhaps only victim. Condemned to be exposed
to wild beasts, he was led to Rome to undergo martyrdom.
<P>
He travelled by land and sea. Passing through Philadelphia, in Lydia, he arrived by land at Smyrna, where he
was greeted by its bishop, Polycarp, and recived delegations
from the neighboring churches of Ephesus, Magnesia, and
Tralles, with their respective bishops, Onesimus, Damasus,
and Polybius. It was at Smyrna that he wrote his letters to
the Ephesians, to the Magnesians, to the Trallians and to the
Romans. From Smyrna he came to Troas, whence he
wrote his letters to the Churches of Philadelphia and
Smyrna and his letter to Polycarp. From there he took
ship to Neapolis, where he resumed the land route, passing
through Philippi and Thessalonica to Dyrrachium (Durazzo)
on the Adriatic Sea. The Philippians received Ignatius
with veneration and after his departure wrote to Polycarp,
begging him to send by his own courier the letter they de-
spatched to the Christians of Antioch and asking him at
the same time to forward to them (the Philippians) what-
ever letters of Ignatius he had in his possession. This is
the last information we have of the Bishop of Antioch.
At Rome he suffered the death he had so earnestly longed
for; but the two accounts of his martyrdom which we possess (<i>Martyrium Romanum</i> and <i>Martyrium Antiochenum</i>)
are legendary.

[3] The opinion of E. Bruston, that Ignatius was a deacon of
Antioch, does not seem to have found many adherents.
<P>
<center>14</center>
<P>
The letters of St. Ignatius have reached us in three different recensions:
<P>
1. The longer recension, besides the seven letters mentioned, more or less enlarged, contains six others: a letter
by a certain Maria of Cassobola to Ignatius and five letters
of Ignatius to Maria of Cassobola, the people of Tarsus,
Antioch and Philippi, and Hero, a deacon of Antioch, -
in all, thirteen letters.[4]
<P>
2. The shorter recension, in Syriac, which contains in
an abbreviated form the three letters to Polycarp, to the
Ephesians, and to the Romans.[5]
<P>
3. The mixed recension, comprising the seven letters to
the Ephesians, the Magnesians, the Trallians, the Romans,
the Philadelphians, the people of Smyrna, and Bishop Polycarp. The text of this recension is not so developed as that
of the longer recension, but more developed than that of
the shorter.
<P>
Scholars are unanimous now in affirming that neither the
longer nor the shorter recension represents the authentic
work of Ignatius. If, therefore, his work has been preserved anywhere, it is in the mixed recension. But the
question arises: Are the seven letters of this recension entirely authentic? This question, which has been the subject of many violent discussions, must be answered in the
affirmative. Arguments based upon internal criticism are
about the only ones that can be brought against such a solution, but they are really without force and must vanish
before the evidence of Eusebius,[6] Origen,[7] St. Irenaeus,[8]
and St. Polycarp.[9] Outside of a few obstinate writers,
all Protestant and rationalist critics now side with Catholics
on this question.[10] We may therefore say that the authenticity of the Ignatian epistles is an established fact.

<P>
[10] Hilgenfeld, Lipsius, and Voelter still continue to hold aloof.
Renan admitted the authenticity of but one Epistle, that to the
Romans, the only one rejected by E. Bruston. Th. Zahn, A.
Harnack, 0. Pfleiderer, J. Reville and Catholics generally claim
authenticity for all seven epistles.  The thesis has been completely
established by J. B. Lightfoot, <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, part II,
vol. 1, 1885.
<P>
<center>15</center>
<P>
When were these letters written? Evidently at a date
which coincides closely with that of the death of St. Ignatius, although it is difficult to fix this date exactly. One
thing alone seems certain, vis., that Ignatius suffered martyrdom under Trajan (98-117). The acts of his martyrdom
indicate the ninth year of Trajan (107); St. Jerome[11] says
the eleventh year (109). We shall hardly err, therefore,
if we place the date of his martyrdom, and consequently also
that of the composition of his letters, about the year 110.
<P>
The main purpose of Ignatius in all his letters, except
that to the Romans, is to warn the faithful against the errors and divisions which certain agents of heresy and schism
endeavored to sow among them. The doctrine these men
were trying to spread was a certain kind of Judaizing
Gnosticism: on the one hand, they urged the preservation of
Jewish practices; on the other they were Docetists, i. e., they
saw in the humanity of Jesus only an unreal appearance.
Furthermore, they separated from the bulk of the Christian
community and conducted their liturgical conventicles apart
from them. St. Ignatius fought against their pretensions by
affirming that Judaism had been abrogated, and by strongly
insisting on the reality of the body and the mysteries of
Jesus. What he seeks above all, though, is to defeat the
propaganda of these heretics in principle by exhorting the
faithful, as the first of their duties, never to separate from
their bishop and clergy. Under the bishop in each church
Ignatius clearly distinguishes a body of priests and deacons
who are subject to him, and who, together with the bishop,
constitute the authority which the faithful must obey if
they wish to maintain unity and purity of doctrine in the
Church of God.
<P>
The Epistle to the Romans was written for a special purpose. Ignatius feared lest the Romans, moved by a false
compassion for him, should attempt to prevent the execution of his death-sentence and therefore begs them to abandon their efforts.
<P>
The style of the Ignatian Epistles is "rude, obscure,
enigmatic, and full of repetitions and entreaties, but it is
<P>
[11] <i>De Vir. ill.</i>, 16.
<P>
<center>16</center>
<P>
always very energetic and here and there strikingly magnificent." [12] No author, unless it be St. Paul, whom Ignatius
resembles in more than one respect, has succeeded better
than he in infusing his whole personality into his writings.
His style, though incorrect and disjointed, is animated by an
irresistible life. An ardent flame burns in these sentences,
from which terse expressions spring forth like flashes of
lightning. Instead of classical equilibrium, we find here
beauty of a higher kind, sometimes, strange, no doubt, but
always emanating from intensity of feeling and from the
very depths of the martyr's piety. From this point of view
nothing can compare with the letter to the Romans, which
Renan has called "one of the jewels of primitive Christian
literature."

<h3>3. ST. POLYCARP AND THE ACTS OF HIS MARTYDOM [1]</h3>
<P>
The memory of St. Polycarp is closely connected with
that of St. Ignatius. He was born very probably in the
year 69 or 70, of well-to-do parents, and was a disciple of
St. John the Evangelist.[2] He conversed with those who had
seen the Lord and was made bishop of Smyrna at a relatively young age, since he was holding that office when he
received St. Ignatius on his way to Rome. St. Irenaeus
extols his great love of tradition and of sound doctrine.[3]
Towards the end of his life, Polycarp visited Pope Anicetus
in Rome to discuss with him the question of the celebration of Easter and to defend the custom which prevailed in
his own church. The two were unable to come to an understanding; but parted in peace.[4] One or two years after
this incident, in 155 or 156, Polycarp died a martyr.
<P>
The circumstances of his martyrdom have been preserved
in a letter written by a certain Marcion in the name of the
Church of Smyrna. This letter was addressed, in the year
following the martyrdom of the holy bishop,[5] to the Church
of Philomelium "and to all the Christians of the

sentenced to be burned alive, but he was stabbed with a
dagger and his body afterwards burnt at the stake. The
Christians were able "to gather his bones, of more value
to them than precious stones and gold, and placed them in
a becoming place," where they could assemble to celebrate
the anniversary of his martyrdom.[7]
<P>
St. Irenaeus speaks of a certain number of letters written by Polycarp,[8] but we have only his letter to the Philipplans, written on the occasion of Ignatius' sojourn among
them. Ignatius had induced the Christians of Philippi to
write to the faithful of Antioch and congratulate them
upon the fact that the persecution, which had carried away
their bishop, was now at an end. The Philippians had
requested Polycarp to send their letter to the brethren at
Antioch by the same messenger he was about to despatch
to that city; they also asked him for copies of the letters of
Ignatius which might be in his possession. We have Polycarp's reply, written probably soon after the death of St.
Ignatius,[9] but the entire text is extant only in a mediocre
Latin translation. All the Greek manuscripts which have
reached us stop towards the end of ch. ix. Fortunately
Eusebius has transcribed the whole of ch. ix as well as ch.
xiii, - the two most important chapters.[10]
<P>
The authenticity of these letters, bound up as it is with
that of the Ignatian epistles, has been disputed, but they
are certainly genuine.
<P>
There is very little originality in the writings of St. Polycarp. Both the matter and the style are destitute of genius. Wishing to exhort the Christians of Philippi, with
whom he was but slightly acquainted, the Bishop of Smyrna
filled his letter with counsels borrowed from the New
Testament, and more especially from St. Paul's Epistle to the
Philippians. He adds that he is sending them, together with
this letter, all the letters of St. Ignatius in his possession.

<h3>4. PSEUDO-BARNABAS [1]</h3>
<P>
Under the name of St. Barnabas we have a letter preserved in two principal codices, the Sinaiticus (IVth century) and the Hierosolymitanus (1056). With one voice
Christian antiquity indicated as the author of this letter
Barnabas, the companion of St. Paul, although it placed it
among the <font face="Symbol">antilegomenai grafai</font>, that is to say, contested
its canonicity. Modern critics unanimously deny the
genuineness of the letter. When the Epistle was written,
St. Barnabas was certainly no longer alive and, even if he
had been, he would not have adopted the violent and severe
attitude evinced throughout this document.
<P>
The letter was intended for certain converts from paganism, whom a few Judaic Christians - more Jewish than
Christian - were trying to persuade that the Old Law was
still in force. To refute this claim the author devotes the
greater part of his letter (i-xvii) to showing that the Mosaic observances have been abrogated and that the ancient
covenant of God with the Jewish people ceased with the
death of Christ and the promulgation of the Christian law.
He goes farther and asserts that these traditional observances in reality never existed in the sense in which the Jews
understood them. The precepts relating to fasting, circumcision, the Sabbath, the temple, etc., which they had interpreted in a gross material sense, were to be understood spiritually of the mortification of the passions and the
sanctification of the interior temple, which is the soul.
<P>
In the second part, passing abruptly to a new set of ideas,
the author reproduces the contents of the chapters of the
Didache which describe the "<i>Two Ways</i>." It is probable
that he borrowed this description from some other writing,
or from the Didache itself. There are two "Ways of
Life": the way of darkness and vice and the way of light
and virtue; we must follow the latter and turn away from
the former.
<P>
Alexandria and Egypt are commonly designated as the
birthplace of the Letter of Barnabas. It is there we find it
first quoted (by Clement of Alexandria) and there it was

held in great veneration. We could suspect this also from
the strong allegorism displayed throughout the work. The
author sees, for instance, in the 318 slaves of Abraham the
figure of Christ and of His cross (T = 300, <i>ih</i> = 18). He
believes in the millennium.
<P>
It is difficult to determine the date of this composition.
All depends on the interpretation we give to chapters iv
and xvi. Funk and Bardenhewer place it under Nerva's
reign (96-98); Veil, Harnack, and Oger, under the Emperior Hadrian (117-131).

<h3>5. THE DOCTRINE OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES[1]</h3>
<P>
The Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles (<font face="Symbol">Didach twu dwdeka
apostolwn</font>), frequently called also by the shorter name
of Didache, was not entirely unknown when the complete text was first discovered. The Epistle of Pseudo-Barnabas, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, the author of
the Apostolic Constitutions, and others had quoted it or
embodied fragments of it in their works. St. Athanasius
had even mentioned it expressly by its title, the "<i>Doctrine
of the Apostles</i>." The treatise was very popular in the
early Church; some looked upon it even as an inspired
book.[2] But the complete original text was discovered only
in 1873, by Philotheos Bryennios in the <i>Codex Hierosolymitanus</i>, which dates from 1056. The editio princeps appeared in 1883. It has since been followed by many others. Besides the original Greek, there exist also a Latin
version of the first six chapters[3] and a few fragments from
an Arabic translation.[4] Quotations in the <i>Adversus
Aleatores</i> and by St. Optatus prove that there must have
existed, as early as the IInd century, a Latin version, dif-
ferent from the one we possess now, which contained the
whole work.

The Didache may be divided into four clearly distinct
parts: a moral catechesis (i-vi), a liturgical instruction
(vii-x); a disciplinary instruction (xi-xv), and a conclusion
of an eschatological nature (xvi).
<P>
1. The moral catechesis teaches us what we must do
(The Way of Life, i-iv) and what we must not do (The
Way of Death, v, vi).
<P>
2. The liturgical instruction treats of Baptism, how to
administer it and how to prepare oneself for its reception
(vii); fasting (viii, 1); prayer (viii, 2, 3), and the celebration of the Holy Eucharist (ix, x).
<P>
3. The disciplinary instruction is concerned with the manner of dealing with preachers, and especially with itinerant
apostles (xi, 3-6), prophets (xi, 7-12; xiii, I, 3-7), travelling brethren (xii), and teachers who settle in the com-
munity (xiii, 2) ; then passing on to the interior life of
the Church, it prescribes the divine service for Sundays
and lays down the line of conduct to be followed with regard to bishops, deacons, and the brethren of the community (xiv-xv).
<P>
4. The conclusion is a warning to be vigilant because
the coming of the Savior is at hand. It contains also a
description of the signs which will precede and accompany
the parousia (xvi).
<P>
The Didache is an anonymous writing and its author is
unknown. Whoever he was, he fused the different parts
of the work into a harmonious whole. The problem is to
ascertain whether he made use of works already in existence
and, more especially, whether the first six chapters (the
moral catechesis) constituted an independent treatise, which
the author appropriated and incorporated with his work.
A few indications here and there seem to favor this view.
Under the title of <i>The Two Ways</i> a short moral treatise
seems to have been in circulation. The author of the
Didache and several other writers who have cited him. may
have merely performed a work of transcription. This conclusion, however, is not certain. As to the hypothesis that
<i>The Two Ways</i> was a Jewish work, Christianized by the addition of passages I, 3 to II, 1, we must say that it is not substantiated by the facts.
<P>
The dates fixed upon by critics for the composition of
the Didache fall between the years 50 and 160. The work
was probably composed between 80 and 110. The basis for
<P>
<center>21</center>
<P>
such a conclusion is the fact that the liturgy and hierarchy
which the author describes, are quite primitive; there is
no trace in the work of a creed or a canon of the Scriptures,
and no allusion is made to pagan persecution or Gnosticism.
On the other hand, the writer is acquainted with the gospels
of St. Matthew and St. Luke and entertains an obvious
mistrust towards wandering Christian teachers who visit
the communities. This state of affairs is characteristic of
the end of the first century.
<P>
It is impossible to determine precisely the place where
this work was composed. It was certainly written in the
East, but nothing warrants our saying with certainty whether
its birthplace was Syria, Palestine, or Egypt.
<P>
The <i>Didache</i> is a work of considerable importance.
Apart from its dogmatic content, it gives us a pretty accurate
picture of what was, in those early times, the interior life
of the Christian communities from the point of view of
moral teaching, the practices they observed, and the form
of government under which they lived. Some authors have
seen in this work the most ancient of Christian rituals; it
is perhaps more exact to characterize it as a kind of
"<i>Vade Mecum</i>" for the faithful and a directory for the
use of the Church officials.

<h3>6. THE HOMILY CALLED SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. CLEMENT[1]</h3>
<P>
The so-called Second Epistle of St. Clement is found in
two Greek manuscripts and in the Syriac manuscript of the
authentic letter of St. Clement. However, Eusebius, who is
the first to mention it, is careful to remark[2] that "it was
not as well known as the first Epistle, since ancient writers
have made no use of it." In fact, it is neither a letter nor
a formal epistle, but a homily or discourse which was read
in the meetings of the faithful. "Brothers and Sisters,
after [the word of] the God of truth, I read to you this
exhortation, that listening to the things which have been
written, you may save yourselves and your lector with
you."[3] The hypothesis that this epistle is identical with

certain questions raised by the letter.

<P>

<P>
<center>22</center>
<P>
the Letter of Pope Soter to the Corinthians,[4] spoken of by 
Denis of Corinth, is therefore untenable. Neither can this 
homily be attributed to Pope St. Clement. The silence of 
ancient writers militates strongly against such an hypothesis, 
and "style, tone, and thought are in such complete contrast 
with the (authentic) Letter to the Corinthians that from 
internal criteria alone we should be justified in refusing to 
attribute this second composition to the author of the first 
Letter."[5]
<P>
It is, therefore, an anonymous sermon by an unknown author. As the work is not an orderly treatise on a particular 
subject, its contents are difficult to analyze. After affirming 
the divinity of Christ, the author dwells at length on the 
value of the salvation He has brought us and on the care with 
which we should observe the commandments (i-iv). We 
can work out our salvation only by waging a continual warfare against the world. Let us then embark for this heavenly battle (v-vii) and strive to practice the Christian virtues of penance, purity, mutual love, trust in God, and devotion to the Church (viii-xvii). Conclusion: Let us work 
for our salvation, come what may: Glory be to God! 
(xviii-xx).
<P>
It is plain that this discourse is not a homily, properly so 
called, upon a specific text of S. Scripture, but a stirring 
exhortation to live a Christian life and thereby to merit 
heaven. "The thought is often very commonplace, expressed awkwardly and not always definitely. The composition is loose and devoid of orderly plan, but there are a 
few striking sentences scattered here and there." It is the 
work of a writer who is inexperienced, yet full of what he 
has to say and who, at times, expressed himself with unction.
<P>
A number of critics, struck by the resemblance existing 
between this work and the Shepherd of Hermas, have concluded that it was written in Rome. The analogy, however, 
is not very pronounced. Others have perceived in vii, 1, 3, 
where mention is made of wrestlers who hasten to the 
combat under full sail and of Christians embarking for battle, an allusion to the Isthmian games, and think that the ex- 
hortation was read at Corinth. This would explain how, in 
the manuscripts, it came to be placed alongside of the 
Letter of St. Clement to the Corinthians. The hypothesis 
does not lack probability.

As to the date of composition, critics agree in placing it 
in the first half of the second century, more precisely between 120 and 140, before the rise of the great Gnostic 
systems of which the writer does not seem to be aware.

<h3>7. THE SHEPHERD OF HERMAS[1]</h3>
<P>
We possess under the name of Hermas a longish composition entitled <i>The Shepherd</i>, of which there are extant 
two Greek manuscripts, both incomplete,[2] two Latin versions 
(one very ancient, called <i>Vulgata</i>), an Ethiopic version, 
and a few fragments of a Coptic version. The title of the 
work is borrowed from the personage who plays the principal part in the second division of the work, the Angel of 
Penance to whose care Hermas has been entrusted, and who 
appears to him in the guise of a shepherd (Vision v).
<P>
Who was the author of this book? Origen saw in him 
the Hermas whom St. Paul greets at the end of his Epistle 
to the Romans (xvi, 14). Others have made him a contemporary of St. Clement of Rome, according to vision ii, 
4, 3. By far the most probable opinion is that based upon 
the authority of the Canon of Muratori, and that of the 
Liberian Catalogue, which makes Hermas a brother of 
Pope Pius I (c. 140-155). "As to the <i>Shepherd</i>" says 
the Muratorian Fragment, "it has been written quite recently, in our own time, in the city of Rome, by Hermas, 
while Pius, his brother, occupied, as bishop, the see of the 
Church of the city of Rome."
<P>
This evidence seems conclusive. It does not, however, 
give us any details concerning the life of Hermas. The 
author, in his book, furnishes us with these. According to 
his autobiography, Hermas was a slave and a Christian. He was sold at Rome to a Christian lady, named 
Rhode, who soon set him free. He then applied himself 
to agriculture and commerce and rapidly acquired great 
wealth. In consequence, he began to neglect the moral

guidance of his family and, more especially, failed to correct his wife and children, who led vicious lives. Then 
came the persecution. Hermas and his wife confessed the 
faith, but their children apostatized, denounced their parents, and indulged in all kinds of debauchery. The 
result was that Hermas lost his fortune and was reduced 
to the possession of a small farm, situated on the road leading to the Roman Campagna; this was enough to support 
him. The trial he had undergone proved very salutary. 
Hermas had been an indifferent Christian; he now became 
fervent. It was while he was endeavoring to make amends 
for the past that the events occurred which he now relates.
<P>
It is difficult to disentangle what is true from what is pure 
fiction in these details. Hermas is surely a historical personage, and probably certain features of his life are not 
without historical foundation. Others may have been invented for the purposes of the book. Since Hermas has 
invented many things, as we shall prove, he may well have 
invented also his supposed autobiography.
<P>
The end he had in view was to call sinners to penance. 
Hermas is conscious of grave disorders which have crept 
into the Roman Church (Simil., viii, 6-10; ix, 19-31), not 
only among the laity, but even among the clergy. Ought 
not these sinners to do penance? Certain imposters denied 
it (Simil., viii, 6, 5). Hermas affirms that they should. 
Will this penance, which is necessary, be useful to those 
who perform it, and will it merit pardon for them? Some 
rigorist teachers thought it would not, and asserted that 
the only salutary penance was that performed before baptism 
(Mandat, iv, 3, l); Hermas announces in the name of God 
that, at least at the moment when he is writing, one penance after baptism is both possible and efficacious, and affirms that his express mission is to invite sinners to take 
advantage of such a favor. Lastly, how should penance 
be performed? Hermas describes the process in the course 
of his book. These three ideas,&#151; the necessity of penance, 
its efficacy, and its requisite conditions,&#151; form the ground- 
work of <i>The Shepherd</i>.
<P>
Hermas does not present these ideas as his own. In order that they may be the more readily accepted by his readers, he presents them as moral instructions which he has received through the special agency of supernatural manifestations. He assumes the attitude of a seer and a prophet,
<P>
<center>25</center>
<P>
like those who existed in the first days of the Church, and 
his entire book is nothing more than an account of the visions and revelations which have been made to him.
<P>
From this point of view, <i>viz.</i>, that of the <i>form</i>, <i>The Shepherd</i> is divided into three parts, which comprise, respectively, five <i>Visions</i>, twelve <i>Commandments</i>, and ten <i>Similitudes</i> (or parables). This distinction is made by the author 
himself, but it must not be taken in a strict sense, "because the <i>commandments</i> and the <i>similitudes</i> contain nearly 
as many visions as the <i>visions</i> properly so called, and the 
<i>visions</i> and <i>similitudes</i> in their turn are crammed with commandments."[3] In reality, Hermas divides his book into 
two distinct sections, according to the personage who appears and speaks to him. In the first four visions that 
personage is the Church. She appears to him first in the
guise of an aged and feeble woman; in the following visions 
she grows constantly younger and more graceful. From 
the fifth vision on, a new personage appears and remains 
upon the scene until the close of the volume. This is the 
Shepherd or Angel of Penance to whose care Hermas has 
been entrusted. The Shepherd first dictates to him the 
twelve <i>Commandments</i> and next bids him write out the 
<i>Similitudes</i> or parables.
<P>
The twelve <i>Commandments</i> form a small code of practical morals. They insist upon the virtues and good works 
which a penitent must practice if his penance is to be efficacious,&#151; faith, fear of God, simplicity, truthfulness, chastity in marriage, patience, temperance, trust in God, Christian joy, the discernment of true and false prophets.
<P>
The <i>Similitudes</i>, or symbolical visions, are ten in number. 
They resume the theme of the visions and further develop 
the necessity and efficacy of penance and the conditions 
requisite for it. Three of these similitudes are particularly 
important: the fifth (the parable of the vineyard and the 
faithful servant), the eighth (the parable of the willow 
tree), and the ninth (which returns to the third vision and 
relates the construction of the tower of the Church).
<P>
Link and Baumgartner[4] have established beyond a doubt 
that the Shepherd is the work of one author. But it does 
not necessarily follow that Hermas wrote successively and

<P>
at one sitting all the parts of his work. On the contrary, 
there were certainly interruptions of time between the composition of the first four visions and that of the fifth, between the composition of Similitude ix and that of Similitude ix. But it is difficult to determine the duration of 
these intervals: nothing proves that they lasted, at the most,
more than four or five years.
<P>
<i>The Shepherd</i> was evidently written at Rome. The Mu- 
ratorian Fragment affirms that it was composed during the 
pontificate of Pius I, between 140 and 155, or thereabouts. 
The best we can do is to accept this date, which is supported by what Hermas says about the persecutions, the 
state of the Roman Church, and the errors which were beginning to circulate in his time.
<P>
From the moment of its appearance <i>The Shepherd</i> was 
received with high esteem in both the East and the West. 
Several Fathers (St. Irenaeus, Tertullian&#151;whilst still a 
Catholic,&#151; Clement of Alexandria, and Origen) considered 
it an inspired work, athough they did not place it on the 
same footing as the canonical books. <i>The Shepherd</i> was 
esteemed as the work of a true prophet and was appended 
to the New Testament in manuscripts of the Bible. The 
Muratorian Fragment, Eusebius, and St. Athanasius are 
more exact when they state that The Shepherd of Hermas 
is assuredly an excellent book, but cannot be compared to 
the books recognized by the Church as canonical. Its repu- 
tation did not last beyond the IVth century, and in 392, St. 
Jerome could say that <i>The Shepherd</i> was almost unknown 
among the Latin churches. The interest it had created 
dwindled away in the Greek churches also. In the decree of Pope Gelasius (496) it is named among the apocryphal books.
<P>
Considered in itself, the book is very interesting and, in
spots, affords agreeable reading. However, this is not owing 
to the literary gifts and genius of the writer. Hermas was 
an uneducated man and seems not to have read or known 
anything outside of the Bible and a few Jewish or Christian 
apocrypha. He was entirely unacquainted with philosophy. 
He lacks imagination. "His grammar is faulty, his style 
clumsy and diffuse, and filled with long sentences and 
wearisome repetitions ... his logic is extremely defective;
he does not even know the art of writing correctly."[5]
<P>
[5] Lelong.
<P>
<center>27</center>
<P>
Speculations on Christian dogma are clearly beyond the 
comprehension of such a poor writer and indifferent theologian. But, although not a learned man, he is a shrewd 
observer and has a sane and just mind, a tender heart, and 
good practical judgment&#151;qualities which unite in making 
him an excellent moralist. He is very considerate and moderate: he exacts of human frailty only what is possible and, 
in consequence of the deep sense he has of divine mercy, 
shows himself very lenient and optimistic. His book must 
certainly have done a great deal of good.

<h3>8. PAPIAS AND THE PRESBYTERS</h3>
<P>
Papius[1] is known to us through St. Irenaeus and Eusebius. He was bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia, a friend of 
St. Polycarp, and, having conversed with the immediate disciples of the Apostles, belonged, at the latest, to the third 
generation of Christians.[2] Critics are still debating whether 
the John, whose disciple he was, was St. John the Apostle, 
or a presbyter of that name. Eusebius speaks of Papias as a 
feeble man of limited mental power.
<P>
Papias composed only one work, the "Explanation of 
the Sayings of the Lord" (<font face="Symbol">Dogiwg kuriakwn ezhghseiV</font>), in five 
books. This treatise not only explains the words of 
Christ but also deals with His life. The author does not 
take the sayings of Christ from the Gospel text alone but 
relates parables from oral tradition, which Eusebius thought 
queer, reports a number of special utterances of the Redeemer, and a few stories which are pure fables.[3] Among 
the latter are to be classed certain realistic descriptions of 
the millennium, in which Papias was a fervent believer.
<P>
According as they see in John the presbyter, with whom 
Papias conversed, the Apostle John, or another personage 
of the same name, critics assign the composition of the 
Explanation to an earlier or a later date. Zahn places this

<P>
Of the work of Papias we possess only a few short fragments given by St. Irenaeus, Eusebius, and Apollinaris. 
The two most important relate to the gospels of St. Mark 
and St. Matthew.
<P>
Ancient writers (Origen, Clement of Alexandria, Papias 
himself, and especially St. Irenaeus) often mention the 
presbyters or one presbyter in particular as having said certain things or taught certain doctrines. Papias gives this 
name to the Apostles,[4] but it applies more generally to the 
disciples of the Apostles, or to the disciples of these disciples, the word presbyter (ancient) being used relatively 
to the speaker. Thus Papias is a presbyter for St. 
Irenaeus and Aristion a presbyter for Papias. The presbyters are men who lived between A. D. 70-150 and who may 
have conversed either with the Apostles or with their immediate disciples. A few among them seem to have been 
writers, Aristion for example. Their accounts and teachings are, however, quoted as oral traditions and in the form 
of brief sentences. There is no complete collection of the 
words of the presbyters. Funk has gathered together those 
found in St. Irenaeus.[5]

the omission of the words <i>creatorem caeli et terrae . . . 
conceptus est . . . passus . . . mortuus . . . descendit ad 
inferos . . . omnipotentis . . . Credo . . . catholicam, sanctorum communionem . . . vifam aeternam</i>. These words 
are nothing more than additions made by the different 
churches[4] and finally adopted by the Roman Church after it 
had ignored them for a long time.
<P>
This symbol is the one which the Roman Church required 
the catechumens to learn and recite before receiving Baptism. In course of time it was adopted by all the churches 
of the West. It is not so sure that the Eastern churches 
adopted it before the Council of Nicaea or that the formulas of faith we find in these churches during the first three 
centuries are derived from it.
<P>
To what period may we trace the origin of this symbol 
and is it the work of the Apostles themselves? There is 
no doubt that the symbol embodies the doctrine of the 
Apostles and therefore may be attributed to them at least 
in substance. All its elements are found in the New Testament.
<P>
Rufinus goes a step further. He narrates, as a tradition 
current in his time, that the Apostles, before separating, 
composed this symbol that it might be the common theme 
of their preaching and the rule of faith for their followers. 
In this hypothesis the symbol would literally be the work 
of the Apostles.[5] It is strange, however, if this tradition 
has a real foundation, that so venerable a formula was not 
preserved and amplifications were allowed to creep into 
it in the West. More probably the Apostles' Creed was 
composed in Rome towards the end of the first or the beginning of the second century. This conclusion is based 
upon the fact that we find traces of it and very probably 
quotations from it in Tertullian, St. Irenaeus, and St. Justin. The necessity of a formula of this kind for the liturgy 
of Baptism must have been felt at an early date and met 
promptly. The text, as we now have it, its lapidary style
<P>
[4] The formula of the symbol of Niceta of Remesiana (beginning 
of Vth century) contains all these additions, except <i>conceptus . . . 
descendit ad inferos . . . omnipotentis . . . Credo</i> (Burn, <i>Niceta 
of Remesiana</i>, Introduction, p. Ixxiv).
<P>
[5] The theory that each of the Twelve Apostles formulated one 
of the twelve articles of the symbol can be traced back to the 
VIth century and is found in sermons falsely attributed to St. 
Augustine (<i>P. L.</i>, xxxix, Serm. ccxl and ccxii).
<P>

<P>
and its complete absence of allusions to heresies of the 
second century, is well suited to the Roman genius and 
characteristic of the period immediately following the death 
of the Apostles. Rome alone possessed sufficient influence 
to impose a symbol upon the churches of both the East and 
the West. The Apostles' Creed cannot, therefore, have been 
composed by the Church in the middle of the second century as a weapon against Gnosticism, as Ehrhard and Harnack surmise, but must be anterior to these controversies.
