<P>
The Church in the second century had not only to maintain
her right to exist against the pagans; she had also
to defend her faith against the heretics. Side by side with
the Apologists, therefore, she numbered many controversialists
and doctors. Before speaking of their works, a word
should be said of the principal authors and writings they had
to confute. We shall complete the study with a passing notice
of the Apocryphal Writings, especially the New Testament
Apocrypha, a great number of which, as we shall see,
are of heretical origin.
<P>
In many cases we shall have to content ourselves with
merely indicating the titles of the writings, both for the sake
of brevity and because many of these works are known only
by their names. With the exception of a few books, the
heretical literature of the second century has perished, because
the Church waged war against it and also because such
uninteresting works were naturally neglected. Once the
sects died out, their literary productions passed quickly into
oblivion.
<P>
Three great heterodox movements assailed the Church or
developed in her bosom during the second century: Judeo-Christianity,
Gnosticism, and Montanism. We shall devote
a few pages to each.
<P>
<a name="#judeo"> </a>

<h3>1. JUDEO-CHRISTIAN LITERATURE[1]</h3>
<P>
Judeo-Christianity, known also, in its strictest and frankly
heretical form, as Ebionitism, sprang from an excessive
attachment of certain Jewish Christians to the ceremonies
and prescriptions of the Mosaic Law. These Christians
<P>
[1] See O. Bardenhewer, <i>Gesch. der altkirchlich. Literatur</i>, I, 2nd
edit., p. 377-381.
<P>
<center>53</center>
<P>
looked upon certain observances which the Gospel had annulled
as indispensable for salvation and regarded Jesus as
a human Messias, such as the Jews were expecting. Their
principal center was at Pella, beyond the Jordan, and in the
surrounding country. They formed various sects: the
Ebionites, the Essenians, and the Elkesaites.
<P>
Among the Ebionite writings we must mention first those
of Symmachus. He is known for his translation of the
Old Testament into Greek (c. 161-211), but composed also
commentaries on an adulterated gospel of St. Matthew;[2]
the so-called <i>Journeys of Peter</i> (<font face="Symbol">Periodoi Petrou</font>); interpolated Acts of the Apostles in use among the members of the
sect, which included the <i>Ascents of James</i> (<font face="Symbol">oi anabaqmoi </font>'<font face="Symbol">Iakwbou</font>); and, most important of all, the <i>Clementine Romances</i>, which have been preserved.
<P>
These writings have been collected under the name of
<i>Clementine Literature</i>, because St. Clement of Rome plays
an important part in them and is even supposed to be their
author. They comprise the <i>Greek Homilies</i> and the <i>Recognitions</i>.[3]
<P>
The <i>Homilies</i> are twenty in number; they are prefaced by
a letter of Peter to James, an attestation (<font face="Symbol">diamarturia</font>) of
James and his priests, and a letter of Clement to James, in
which he informs him that he is sending a summary of
Peter's discourses. The twenty <i>Homilies</i> follow. They
are a mixture of more or less fantastic stories and theological
controversies. Clement tells the story of his own conversion
and of his travels with St. Peter in the persecution ot
Simon Magus. The primary purpose of the work, however,
is to give an exposition of the pretended doctrinal teaching
of Peter. This doctrine is, of course, Ebionite: Christian
revelation is simply a restoration of Mosaic revelation,
which, in turn, is a restoration of primitive revelation.
<P>
The subject-matter of the <i>Recognitions</i> is about the same
as that of the <i>Homilies</i>. We possess them only in a rather
inaccurate Latin translation by Rufinus. The peculiar title
of "Recognitions" is given to the work because, according
to the fictitious accounts which, in both books, form the
framework of the doctrinal discussions, Clement recovers in

the course of his journeys his father, mother, and two 
brothers, whom he had lost.[4]
<P>
According to Waitz and Harnack, the <i>Homilies</i> and the 
<i>Recognitions</i> are two independent recensions of an anterior 
work which bore, perhaps, the title of <i>Clement's Epitome of 
the Sermons made by St. Peter</i> (<font face="Symbol">KlhmentoV twn Petrou epidhmewn khrugmatwn epitomh</font>) or <i>Journeys of Peter</i> [<i>written</i>]
<i>by Clement</i> (<font face="Symbol">Periodoi Petrou dia KlhmentoV</font>; <i>v. supra</i>). This 
work is regarded as the synthesis of two others still more 
ancient,&#151;the <i>Sermons of Peter</i> (<font face="Symbol">Khrugmata Petrou</font>), clearly 
Ebionite-Gnostic, and the <i>Acts of Peter</i> (<font face="Symbol">PraxeiV Petrou</font>), 
anti-Gnostic. The <i>Homilies</i> and the <i>Recognitions</i>, and the 
writings of which they are summaries, are said to be the 
work of orthodox authors, whose primary purpose was to 
write an edifying apology, but who did not take sufficient 
care to eliminate the Judeo-Christian characteristics contained
in the <font face="Symbol">Khrugmata</font>. Harnack thinks that the <i>Homilies</i>
and the <i>Recognitions</i> received their present form in the 
fourth century at Rome, or in Syria, the book of which they 
are recensions having been composed between 225 and 300 
at Rome, and the two primitive works c. 200.
<P>
A work entitled <i>The Book of Elkesai</i> (Elxai), brought to 
Rome c. 220-230 by a certain Alcibiades,[5] was attributed to 
Elkesai (Elxai), the (problematical) founder of the sect of 
the Elkesaites. St. Epiphanius[6] mentions a book of Jexai, 
brother of Elkesai, which was also in use in the sect.

<h3>2. GNOSTIC LITERATURE[1]</h3>
<P>
The generic name of <i>Gnostics</i> comprised a number of 
sects the doctrines and tendencies of which were often at 
great variance, but all of which claimed to be in possession 
of a superior religious science and a far more penetrating 
insight into Christian revelation than that of the simple
<P>
[4] Besides these two principal texts, we have: a) a Syriac compilation
of the Clementine Romances, which combine the two texts;
b) two Greek epitomes, which sum up the Homilies, and c) two 
Arabic epitomes, which sum up the Homilies and the Recognitions.

<P>
faithful and the official Church. Two important questions 
above all others attracted the attention of these sects: the 
origin of evil and the manner in which the redemption was 
effected. Each sect discussed these problems and each endeavored
to solve the mystery.
<P>
Gnostic literature was very voluminous. Since the Gnostics
generally professed that men have to work out their salvation
by means of science (<i>gnosis</i>), they were naturally led 
to write out for the use of their adepts a good part of their 
teachings and secret traditions. Very little, however, remains
of all this literature,&#151; at the most five or six complete 
works and a number of fragments inserted in the writings 
of the historians of heresies.[2] In the following sketch we 
can mention only the principal works.
<P>
We will follow the order commonly adopted in speaking 
of the Gnostic sects: Syrian Gnosis, Alexandrine Gnosis, 
Marcionism and Encratism. This classification is merely 
provisional and questionable in some details; but for want 
of a better one it may be accepted.
<P>
1. Syrian Gnosis.&#151;It is a well-known fact that ancient 
authors are agreed in recognizing Simon Magus as the 
father of Gnosticism. St. Hippolytus gives us quotations 
from, as well as an analysis of, a <i>Revelation</i> ('<font face="Symbol">ApofasiV</font>), 
the book used by the Simonians.[3] We do not know whether 
Cerinthus, Menander, or Satornilus wrote anything. The 
Nicolaites possessed some Books of <i>Ialdabaoth</i>, a book entitled
<i>Noria</i>, a <i>Prophecy of Barkabbas</i>, a <i>Gospel of Perfection</i>
(or <i>consummation</i>, <font face="Symbol">teleiwsewV</font>) and a <i>Gospel of Eve</i>, 
which seems to have been an apocalypse.[4]
<P>
2. Alexandrine Gnosis.&#151; This Gnosis is represented 
first by three great leaders &#151; Basilides, Valentine and Carpocrates&#151;and
secondly by a multitude of more or less 
definite sects without leaders, who have received the generic 
name of <i>Ophites</i>.
<P>
a) Basilides taught at Alexandria, between 120 and 
140, a doctrine which, according to his followers, he received 
from a certain Glaukias, interpreter of St. Peter. He had 
a son named Isidorus, who kept up the teaching after his 
father's death. Basilides wrote a <i>Gospel</i>, 23 or 24 books of
<P>
[2] These fragments may be largely found in tome VII of the 
<i>Patrologia Graeca</i>, col. 1263-1322.
<P>
[3] Philosoph., vi, 7-20.
<P>
[4] Philastrius, <i>Haer.</i>, 33; St. Epiphanius, <i>Haer.</i>, xxv-xxvi.
<P>
<center>56</center>
<P>
<i>Commentaries</i> on it, a few quotations of which still remain, 
and some <i>Odes</i>, mentioned by Origen and the Muratorian 
Fragment. His son, Isidorus, left three works: <i>On the 
Second Soul</i> (<font face="Symbol">Peri prosfuouV yuchV</font>), i.e., the soul of man 
under the influence of the passions; <i>Ethica</i>, and an
<i>Exposition of the Prophet Parchor</i> in at least two books.
<P>
b) The Valentinians were the most considerable and 
the best known of all the Gnostic sects. Valentine himself
was an Egyptian and pretended to have studied under 
a certain Theodas, a personal disciple of St. Paul. He 
preached his doctrine first in Egypt, came to Rome under 
Pope Hyginus, and resided there until the advent of Pope 
Anicetus, about 135-160. He was driven out of the 
Church several times and at length retired to the Isle of
Cyprus.
<P>
Tertullian praises the wisdom and eloquence of Valentine. 
Early writers are acquainted with his <i>Letters</i>, <i>Homilies</i>, 
and <i>Psalms</i>, but he does not seem to have written the <i>Gospel 
of Truth</i> which, according to St. Irenaeus (iii, 11, 9), was
in use among the members of his sect.
<P>
This sect spread throughout the Roman Empire and soon 
divided into two branches, known respectively as the Western
or Italian branch, which declared that the body of the 
Savior was of a psychic nature, and the Eastern branch,
which maintained that it was pneumatic.
<P>
Heracleon belonged to the Western branch and was the 
ablest of Valentine's disciples. He wrote between 155 and 
180. We have more than forty fragments, some of them 
lengthy, of his commentary on St. John, entitled '<font face="Symbol">Upomnhmata</font>. 
The commentary itself probably went no further than the 
tenth chapter. As a rule his exegesis is allegorical.
<P>
Ptolemy was another personal disciple of Valentinus, 
He has left us a <i>Letter to Flora</i>, the complete text of which 
was preserved by St. Epiphanius.[5] Flora was a Christian 
lady, who hesitated to undertake the studies or gnosis imposed
by the Gnostics. To convince her, Ptolemy undertakes
to prove that at least part of the Old Law was the 
work, not of the Supreme God, but of the Demiurge.
<P>
After these two great representatives of Western Valentinianism,
we must name: Florinus, to whom St. Irenaeus 
addressed a letter reproaching him with his blasphemous 
writings; Theotimus, who wrote on the figures of the Old
<P>
[5] <i>Haer</i>., xxxiii, 3-7.
<P>
<center>57</center>
<P>
Testament, and Alexander, author of a book alluded to by
Tertullian,[6] which may have been entitled <i>Syllogisms</i>.
<P>
The principal writers of the Eastern branch of the Valentinians
are Marcus, Theodotus, and Bardesanes.
<P>
Marcus, whom some authors assign to the Western 
branch, taught in Asia Minor, c. 180. He is known to us 
principally through St. Irenaeus, who very probably possessed
one of his works and also some of the numerous 
works of his sect.
<P>
Of Theodotus we know nothing, but Clement of Alexandria
had at least one of his writings, since he gives a 
series of extracts from it in his <i>Excerpta ex Scriptis Theodoti</i>.[7]
<P>
Bardesanes is generally counted among the Valentinians, 
and indeed Eusebius[8] affirms that, before he became an 
orthodox Catholic, he was more or less infected by Valentinianism.
It is infinitely more probable, however, that the 
qualification of Gnostic is less applicable to the master than 
to his disciples, who distorted his teachings. Bardesanes 
devoted himself especially to the exact sciences and to astrology.[9]
He was born of noble parents at Edessa, July 11, 
154, and in his youth was the companion of the future 
toparch of Edessa, Abgar IX (179-214). After the conquest
of Edessa by Caracalla, 216-217, he was forced to 
withdraw into Armenia, but returned to his native town 
and died there in 222 or 223.
<P>
St. Ephraem relates that Bardesanes composed 150 <i>Psalms</i>
as well as melodies for them; this would make him the most 
ancient of Syriac hymnologists. It is possible that a few 
fragments of these songs may yet be found in the Syriac 
Acts of St. Thomas. Different authors, among them Eusebius,[10]
attribute to him a few dialogues written against the 
Marcionists and other heretics. His most popular work is 
that <i>On Fate</i> (<font face="Symbol">Peri eimarmenhV</font>), which has been found in 
Syriac, bearing the title of <i>Book of the Laws of the Countries</i>.[11] The work is written in dialogue form, and Bardesanes

<P>
has been considered its author because he is the chief 
interlocutor. In reality, however, it is written by one of 
his disciples, named Philip. Bardesanes makes a study of 
the laws and customs of various countries and proves, 
against a certain Avida, that human liberty is in no way 
affected by the stars.
<P>
Harmonius, the son of Bardesanes, wrote many works in 
Syriac. His <i>Odes</i> are mentioned, and Sozomen[12] says that 
he was the true author of the 150 <i>Psalms</i> mentioned above.
<P>
c) Carpocrates was the third leader of the Alexandrine 
Gnostics. He was a contemporary of Valentine and Basilides.
We do not know if he wrote at all. His son, Epiphanes,
who died when only seventeen years of age, has 
left us a treatise <i>On Justice</i>, cited by Clement of Alexandria.[13]
He is an advocate of out-and-out communism. St. 
Irenaeus mentions in globo several Carpocratian writings
(I, 25, 4, 5).
<P>
d) Under the Alexandrine Gnosis must also be ranged 
the many subsidiary sects derived from it and designated 
under the general name of <i>Ophites</i>, or "Brethren of the 
Serpent." The <i>Ophites</i> were the first to take the name of 
Gnostics. The name <i>Ophites</i> was used in connection with 
the part generally played in their system by the serpent in 
the garden of Eden. These sects branched out very widely 
and produced many writings. Apocrypha of the New Testament
(to be mentioned later) abounded among them. 
Among their other productions we may mention: <i>Great 
and Small Questions of Mary</i>, Hymns and Naasinian 
Psalms, a <i>Paraphrase of Seth</i>, some books attributed to the 
children of Seth, entitled <i>Strangers</i> ('<font face="Symbol">AllogeneiV</font>), a <i>Symphony</i>, an <i>Apocalypse of Abraham</i>, and an <i>Assumption of 
Isaias</i>. The Gnostic Justin, mentioned in the <i>Philosophoumena</i>,
cites, among others, a work entitled <i>Baruch</i>.[14]
Moniumus left us a <i>Letter to Theophrastes</i>.[15]
<P>
According to C. Schmidt, several other Gnostic writings, 
preserved entirely or almost entirely in Coptic, belong to 
the Ophitic literature. These are the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and the 
writings contained in the Bruce papyrus.
<P>
[12] <i>H. E.</i>, iii, 16.
<P>
[13] <i>Strom.</i>, III, 2.
<P>
[14] <i>Philos.</i>, V, 24. 
<P>
[15] <i>Ibid.</i>, viii, 15.
<P>
<center>59</center>
<P>
The work entitled <i>Pistis Sophia</i>,[16] in four books, contains
three distinct writings. The first of these, which 
alone deserves the title of "Pistis Sophia," comprises paragraphs
1-181,[17] and relates the fall and deliverance of the 
eon bearing that name. The second, which probably ought 
to be identified with the <i>Little Questions of Mary</i> (Mary 
Magdalen), commences with paragraph i8i,[18] and ends with 
Book III. It discusses the salvation and fate after death 
of the different categories of men. The third, embodied in 
Book IV, describes the faults and wickedness of the <i>Archontici</i>,
the celebration of the mystery of water, and, finally, the 
punishment of the wicked.
<P>
The Bruce codex[19] (Vth-VIth century) contains two 
distinct writings. The first, in two books, is identical with 
the <i>Two Books of Jeu</i> cited in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>. One of 
these explains the emanation of the eons, describes the invisible
world, and furnishes the reader with the necessary 
pass-words to reach the Father. The other initiates us 
into the three baptisms of water, fire, and spirit, and gives 
other formulas analogous to the pass-words in order to 
overcome the evil spirits. This treatise is followed immediately
by a second, considerably mutilated in the beginning, 
which seems to be a description of the origin of the suprasensible
world and the visible cosmos.[20]
<P>
All these Coptic writings are translated from the Greek 
and date from the third century. From the point of view 
of antiquity they rank as follows: the second treatise in 
the Bruce papyrus comes first, then the books of Jeu and 
the fourth book of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and, finally, the first 
three books of this work.

[20] Besides these works, a Coptic papyrus of Berlin (Vth century?) 
contains three other Gnostic writings, not yet edited: a <i>Gospel of

of Jesus Christ</i>.

About 135-140, he came to Rome and was received into the 
Church. He soon left the Roman communion, however, 
and founded a sect, which spread and became strong, and 
was destined to last for many years. His death occurred, 
at the latest, in the year 170.
<P>
Marcion's system is based upon the opposition between 
the Law, the work of a just God, and the Gospel, the work 
of a good God. In support of his doctrine he published a 
work known as <i>Antitheses</i>, a collection of sentences from 
the Old and New Testaments, which seem to be complete 
antinomies. He also gave his disciples a New Testament 
which he himself had composed. This comprised the Gospel 
of St. Luke, abbreviated and adulterated, and ten epistles of 
St. Paul. Tertullian attributes to him a letter in which he 
tries to justify his apostacy.
<P>
The best known of Marcion's disciples is Apelles. He 
lived for a time with his master in Rome, but afterwards 
left him to settle in Alexandria. There he modified to a 
certain extent the doctrine of Marcion, but returned to Rome, 
where he died shortly after A. D. 180. He wrote a work entitled
<i>Syllogisms</i>, cited by St. Ambrose.[21] This is a very 
lengthy book, in which the author attempts to prove that the 
Books of Moses contain nothing but lies. Another work 
of his is the <i>Revelations</i> (<font face="Symbol">fanerwseiV</font>), which describes the 
pretended revelations of a certain female visionary of the 
sect, named Philumena.
<P>
The Marcionites made use of a special collection of 
Psalms, distinct from those of David, and also of a work 
bearing the obscure title of <i>Liber Propositi Finis</i>, destined 
to supplant the Acts of the Apostles.
<P>
4. ENCRATISM.&#151; The Encratites do not seem to have 
formed a distinct sect. They were found nearly everywhere
and marked by their tendency to reject as sinful both 
matrimony and the use of meat. The Valentinian dissenter, 
Julius Cassianus, was one of their greatest writers. He 
flourished at Antioch or Alexandria c. 170. Clement of 
Alexandria[22] cites two of his works: "'<font face="Symbol">Exhghtika</font> (<i>Commentaries</i>), in several books, and a "<font face="Symbol">Peri egkrateiaV h peri eunouciaV</font>" (<i>On Continence</i>), a condemnation of matrimony.

<h3>3. MONTANISTIC LITERATURE[1]</h3>
<P>
Although St. Hippolytus[2] speaks of countless books written
by the founders of Montanism, we know of very few 
writings belonging to this sect.
<P>
The oracular replies of Montanus, Maximilla, Priscilla, 
and other prophets were certainly collected.[3] About 19 of 
these &#151; some very doubtful &#151; are cited by different authors.[4]
<P>
Tertullian[5] is of the opinion that Montanistic communities
dispatched letters to Rome in order to obtain recognition.
These letters dated very probably from the commencement
of the Montanistic movement, c. 173-180. Eusebius[6]
mentions a reply to the anti-Montanistic work of the apologist
Miltiades and[7] a Letter called <i>Catholic</i>, written by a 
certain Themison. It is also very probable that Proclus
wrote some work or other. He was a defender of Montanism
in Rome under Pope Zephyrinus (198-217), and the 
priest Caius argued against him.[8]
<P>
If we add to these works the Montanistic treatises of Tertullian,
we have a fairly complete summary of the writings 
of the sect that are known to us.

<h3>4. APOCRYPHAL LITERATURE&#151;CHRISTIAN APOCRYPHA OF 
THE OLD TESTAMENT</h3>
<P>
The term <i>apocryphal</i> (<font face="Symbol">apokrufoV</font>, hidden), applied to a 
book, may mean simply that the author and the origin of his 
work are unknown. In ecclesiastical terminology it means 
that this book has been excluded from official use in the 
Church and is not placed in the hands of the faithful. An 
apocryphal book is an uncanonical book and, besides lacking 
ecclesiastical recognition, it is often regarded by the Church

as being more or less legendary and as propagating questionable or erroneous doctrines.
<P>
The purpose of the Biblical Apocrypha is to furnish a new 
treatment of the historical or doctrinal data of the canonical 
books by completing or amplifying them. They are naturally
divided into the Apocrypha of the Old Testament and 
the Apocrypha of the New Testament, according as they 
deal with the period previous or subsequent to the coming 
of Christ.
<P>
As a rule, the authors of the first set are Jews, although 
several of these works have been improved upon by Christian
writers. It is for this reason that Christian interpolations
are to be found in the Fourth Book of Esdras, the 
Book of Henoch, the Assumption of Moses, the Testaments 
of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Apocalypse of Elias, the 
Apocalypse of Sophonias, the Apocalypse of Baruch, the 
Books of Adam, the Sibylline Oracles,[1] etc. Others are 
entirely the work of Christian writers, examples of which 
have already been seen in connection with Gnostic literature. 
To this category belong the <i>Odes of Solomon</i>.
<P>
These odes, forty-two in number, have recently been discovered
in a Syriac manuscript of the XVIth or XVIIth 
century.[2] They are a continuous hymn of the soul in 
thanksgiving to God for having saved it. Their beauty and 
lyric inspiration are remarkable. However, the speaker in 
these odes is not always the same fictitious personage; sometimes
it is the converted Christian, sometimes the elect triumphant
in heaven, sometimes Jesus Christ Himself. The 
tone is personal and intimate. No mention is made of the 
ecclesiastical hierarchy, or of the sacrifice of the Redeemer, 
or of the Sacraments. The terminology closely resembles 
that of St. John.
<P>
The most divergent opinions have been put forth concerning
the origin of these odes. The most probable is that they 
were written entirely in Greek by a Christian in the first half 
of the second century. The Syriac in that hypothesis would 
be a translation. It has not yet been proved that the author 
was a Docetist or even a Gnostic, a few vague textual indications

<h3>5. THE APOCRYPHA OF THE NEW TESTAMENT &#151; THE GOSPELS[1]</h3>
<P>
The authors of the New Testament Apocrypha are naturally
Christians. From the point of view of form, these 
writings, like the canonical New Testament literature, comprise
Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Epistles and Apocalypses.
From the point of view of origin and tendency, we 
may divide them into two distinct groups. The first group 
is of heretical and particularly of Gnostic origin and purposes
to inculcate a very definite doctrinal error, namely, 
that Jesus Christ and His Apostles gave out teachings contrary
to those of the Church. The second is of orthodox 
origin and written with the intention of edifying; hence 
details of the lives of Christ, the Blessed Virgin, the Apostles
and St. Joseph, which are lacking in the official writings,
are added in these compositions.
<P>
Whatever may have been their origin, these Apocrypha 
have two traits in common. The first is the weirdness and 
strangeness of their accounts, in which uncalled-for wonders 
and miracles are scattered profusely. The various actors 
move about in an unreal world where the marvelous is the 
rule. The second is the variance of their texts. As these 
books were not consecrated by the authority of the Church, 
but were widely circulated, people modified them and added 
to them to suit their own tastes. This accounts for the 
many recensions of the same work &#151; new ones are still being
found 2 and also renders it very difficult, nay impossible, 
to determine the origin and date of these writings. It is 
not always easy to distinguish between the primitive work 
and later alterations. Again, many of these Apocrypha,

heretical in the beginning, were afterwards corrected and 
purged of their heresies and have come down to us only in 
the latter form.
<P>
1. <i>The Gospel of the Hebrews</i>. Some of the Apocryphal 
Gospels bear the name of an author, others are anonymous. 
Among the latter we must mention, first, the <i>Gospel according
to the Hebrews</i> (<font face="Symbol">to kaq</font>' '<font face="Symbol">EbraiouV euaggelion</font>), spoken of 
by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, and St. Jerome, 
and probably known also to Hegesippus and St. Ignatius of 
Antioch. Unfortunately, their citations lack precision;
they prevent us especially from seeing the relation of this 
Gospel with the "Gospel of the Ebionites," cited by St. 
Epiphanius.[3] It seems safe, however, to treat these two 
Gospels as two distinct compositions. The Gospel according
to the Hebrews was in use among that orthodox portion
of Judeo-Christians called the Nazaraeans. It was 
written in Aramaic, with square characters, and closely follows
the canonical narrative of St. Matthew. The quotation
by Clement of Alexandria is a proof that this apocryphal
gospel was composed in the middle of the second cen- 
tury at the latest. If, however, as St. Jerome affirms, it 
was cited by St. Ignatius in his Letter to the people of 
Smyrna (iii, 2), it would date at least from the end of the 
first century, as Harnack thinks it does.
<P>
2. <i>The Gospel of the Ebionites</i> was in use among the 
heretical Judeo-Christians, for the quotations by St. Epiphanius
prove that it contains their heretical teachings. 
According to Bardenhewer, it was a compilation from the 
canonical Gospels and is identical with the <i>Gospel of the 
Twelve Apostles</i>, marked out as heretical by Origen.[4] It 
was written in Greek at the end of the second or in the beginning
of the third century.
<P>
3. <i>The Gospel of the Egyptians</i>. Clement of Alexandria[5]
cites a <i>Gospel according to the Egyptians</i> (<font face="Symbol">to kat</font>'<font face="Symbol"> AiguptiouV euaggelion</font>),
known also to Origen, St. Hippolytus, and St. 
Epiphanius, who all regarded it as a heretical work. It condemns
matrimony and upholds Sabellianism and metempsychosis.
Several critics have exaggerated the importance 
of this work. It was probably written in Egypt, towards 
the end of the second century. The date of its composition

would have to be placed much earlier if it were certain that 
it is quoted in the <i>Secunda Clementis</i> (xii, 2).
<P>
4. <i>The Gospel of Peter.</i>[6] Until 1886, the <i>Gospel of Peter</i>
was known to us only through the fragment of a letter of 
Serapion of Antioch cited by Eusebius.[7] Since that date, 
a large fragment, including the history of the Passion and 
Resurrection, was recovered, in 1892, and published. Serapion
characterized this Gospel by saying that, as a whole, it 
was conformable to the teaching of the Savior, but of 
Docetic tendencies. This is precisely the impression made 
upon one who reads what we possess of the work. The 
author made use of the three synoptic Gospels and probably 
also of the Gospel of St. John, and may have composed his 
book at Antioch towards the middle of the second century. 
Harnack believes that the work was known to St. Justin,[8]
and therefore places its composition in 110-130.
<P>
5. <i>The Gospels of Mathias, Philip, and Thomas</i> form a 
trilogy of Gnostic origin, for these three Apostles are represented
in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> as being the three privileged 
witnesses chosen by Jesus Christ after His resurrection.
(i) <i>The Gospel of Mathias</i> we know only by its title; very 
probably it should be distinguished from the <i>Traditions of 
Mathias</i>, cited by Clement of Alexandria,[9] and especially 
favored by the Basilidians. It was composed in Egypt, no 
later than the beginning of the third century. The <i>Traditions</i>,
on the contrary, date back to 110-130. {2) The 
<i>Gospel of Philip</i> was in use among the "Gnostics" in 
Egypt. St. Epiphanius[10] has given us a quotation which 
sufficiently marks it out as heterodox. It was probably 
written towards the end of the second or at the beginning of 
the third century. (3) The <i>Gospel of Thomas</i> was found 
cited in a Naassenian work by St. Hippolytus,[11] and he has 
even preserved for us one sentence from it. St. Irenaeus 
had probably known the work before him,[12] which means 
that it was written in the middle of the second century.

but we have a compilation in Greek, Latin, Syriac, and 
Slavonic which is, to all appearances, derived from the 
original work and which may be a much expurgated original
copy. These forms are entitled <i>Statements of Thomas, 
Jewish Philosopher, upon the Infancy of the Lord</i> (<font face="Symbol">Qwma israhlitou filosofou rhta eiV ta paidka tou Kuriou</font>).[13] They 
relate the miracles performed by the Infant Jesus from His 
fifth to His twelfth year. These miracles do not always 
agree with the character of the Divine Child and the Gnostic
color of the original has not completely disappeared from 
the book in spite of the many transformations it has undergone.
In their actual state these writings seem to belong, 
as a whole, to the fourth or fifth century.
<P>
7. The <i>Protoevangelium Jacobi</i>[14] is the best known and 
most popular of the Apocryphal Gospels. There are many 
Greek manuscripts and versions of it in different languages. 
The title varies with the manuscripts, but in none is to be 
found the name "Gospel." The purpose of the book is to 
give an account of the birth of Mary, her childhood, her 
betrothal to St. Joseph, the birth of Jesus, the slaughter of 
the Innocents and the execution of Zacharias in the temple. 
The author pretends to be James (evidently the Lesser), 
the brother of the Lord. The Greek text, as it stands, does 
not seem to date back further than the fourth century. It 
is supposed to be a composite work, made up of three previous
writings: (a) An account of the birth, infancy, and 
betrothal of Mary (chs. i-xvii, i), the work of a Judeo-Christian,
130-140; (b) An account given by Joseph of the 
birth of Jesus Christ and the adoration of the Magi (chs. 
xvii, 2-xxi), called <i>Apocryphum Josephi</i>, written probably 
in the second century; (c) an account of the slaughter of 
the Innocents and the execution of Zacharias (chs. xxii-xxiv),
called <i>Apocryphum Zachariae</i>, the groundwork of 
which also dates back to the second century.
<P>
8. The <i>Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew</i>. The "Protoevangelium Jacobi"
has its Latin counterpart in the <i>Gospel of 
Pseudo-Matthew</i>, entitled <i>Liber de Ortu Beatae Mariae et 
Infantia Salvatoris</i>,[15] the contents of which are much the 
same as that of the "Protoevangelium," plus the subject

matter of the "Gospel of Thomas." It is a compilation of 
the fifth century.
<P>
9. The <i>Arabic Gospel of the Infancy</i> and other analogous 
compositions in Syriac and Armenian belong to a still later 
period.[16]
<P>
10. Besides these Gospels, we know that there once existed
a <i>Gospel of Bartholomew</i>, a <i>Gospel of Thaddeus</i>, mentioned
in the decree of Pope Gelasius, and a <i>Gospel of Judas 
Iscariot</i> in use among the Cainites and spoken of by St. 
Irenaeus (i, 31, 1). Greek, Latin and Coptic fragments 
have been found of the <i>Gospel of Bartholomew</i>.
<P>
11. To the literature of the Apocryphal Gospels belong 
also the accounts concerning Pilate and the descent of Jesus 
into hell, those about the death of the Blessed Virgin and of 
St. Joseph.
<P>
a) Under the title of <i>Gospel of Nicodemus</i> we possess a 
composition the most ancient recension of which &#151; in Greek 
&#151; dates back to the first half of the fifth century. The 
work may be divided into three parts, which in the beginning 
probably formed two, or even three, distinct writings. The 
first part (chs. l-ll) relates to the interrogatory of Jesus 
before Pilate, His death and burial. It intends to show that 
Pilate was convinced of the innocence of Our Lord. The 
special title, <i>Acta Pilati</i>, is given to this part. St. Epiphanius[17]
was acquainted with some acts of this kind from 
which the <i>Acta Pilati</i> must be derived. It is even possible 
that Tertullian knew of a supposed report of Pilate to Tiberius,
the apologetical purpose of which was the same.[18]
The nucleus of the <i>Acta Pilati</i> would then date back to the 
second century. The second part (chs. 12-16) relates the 
discussions which took place in the Sanhedrin after the 
resurrection of Christ. Its purpose is to prove that the leaders
of the Jews themselves must have admitted the truth of 
His resurrection. The third part (chs. 17-27), which was 
certainly once an independent treatise, relates the descent of 
Jesus into hell and the deliverance of the just of the Old 
Law. The action and brilliancy of style of this part are remarkable.
<P>
b) The title of <i>Dormition of Mary</i> (<i>Transitus Mariae</i>,

<font face="Symbol">KoimhsiV thV MariaV</font>) is given to an account of the death ot 
the Blessed Virgin, the most ancient recensions of which are 
the Greek recension and the two Syriac recensions, B and C. 
The book narrates how Mary died in Jerusalem, surrounded 
by the Apostles, and how her body was carried up into 
heaven. The story contains very ancient elements, but the 
actual form of the work supposes that the cultus of the 
Blessed Virgin was already well developed in the Church. 
It is the general belief that this work does not date earlier 
than the fourth or fifth century.
<P>
c) The <i>History of Joseph the Carpenter</i>,[19] which exists in 
two recensions&#151;one Coptic, the other Arabic&#151;contains 
an account, supposedly by Jesus Himself, of the life and 
more especially the death of St. Joseph. The author seems 
to have borrowed from local traditions as well as from the 
"Gospel of Thomas." The purpose of the book is well indicated
in ch. 30: &#151; it was intended to furnish matter for 
liturgical readings for the Feast of St. Joseph, celebrated on 
the 26th of the month of Epiphi, <i>i.e.</i>, July 20. The original 
Greek text from which the recensions were made dates back, 
at most, to the fourth century. It is probably even more 
recent.

<h3>6. APOCRYPHAL ACTS OF THE APOSTLES[l]</h3>
<P>
The imagination of certain writers has, perhaps, thrown 
off restraint more in the apocryphal Acts of the Apostles 
than in the apocryphal Gospels. Indeed, they were allowed 
much more freedom in this by the official text of the canonical
Acts, which does not mention the fate of the Twelve, 
with the exception of St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. James, 
nor relate the last years of the ministry of the two great 
apostles.
<P>
i. Concerning St. Peter, we have first a Preaching of 
Peter (<font face="Symbol">Petrou Khrugma</font>), known to Clement of Alexandria, 
Heracleon the Gnostic, Origen, and Eusebius. The work 
must probably be identified with the <i>Preaching of Peter</i>

Lipsiae, 1891, i8o8, 1903. The classical work on the subject is that

a series of missionary discourses of the Apostle, together
with a connecting narrative. There is nothing to 
prove that it was a heretical writing. It was composed in 
the first half of the second century, either in Egypt or in
Greece.
<P>
2. The <i>Acts of Peter</i> (<font face="Symbol">PraxeiV Petrou</font>),[2] on the contrary,
are plainly Gnostic. Two parts of this work are extant,
namely,
<P>
a) The conclusion of the work in the <font face="Symbol">Marturion tou agiou apostolou Petrou</font>, of which the <i>Martyrium Beati Petri Apostoli a Lino Apostolo Conscriptum</i> is only an enlarged Latin
version; and
<P>
b) The episode of the triumph of St. Peter over Simon 
Magus in the <i>Actus Petri cum Simone</i> of the manuscript of 
Vercelli. In this work are to be found the details concerning 
the fall of Simon Magus, the "Quo Vadis" and the crucifixion
of the Apostle, head downwards. Although various 
corrections have been introduced into the actual text, it still 
bears traces of Docetism and Encratism. The original 
composition must have dated back to the second half of the 
second century. Pope Innocent[13] declared that the author 
was identical with the author of the Gnostic "Acts of John," 
i.e., Pseudo-Lucius (the Lucius Charinus spoken of by
Photius).
<P>
3. Just as there was a "Preaching of Peter," so there 
was a Preaching of Paul. It is mentioned in the <i>Liber de 
Rebaptismate</i> (17), which was written in the time of St. 
Cyprian. The work does not appear to be orthodox; however,
we lack information concerning it.
<P>
4. Quite different has been the fate of the Acts of Paul 
(<font face="Symbol">PraxeiV Paulou</font>), which is said to have contained 3560 or 
3600 lines. These Acts have been recently found in a Coptic
version,[4] although the manuscript is in bad condition. 
This discovery has enabled us to ascertain that the original 
text comprised the <i>Martyrdom of the Holy Apostle Paul</i>, 
the <i>Correspondence of St. Paul and the Corinthians</i> (apocryphal),

<P>
and the Acts of <i>Paul and Thecla</i>, which at a later 
date took on an independent form. But since Tertullian 
affirms[5] that the story of Paul and Thecia was composed in 
Asia by a priest who was very enthusiastic about St. Paul, 
and who was deposed for his writing, it is likely that the 
entire Acts of Paul are the work of the same author and 
were composed in Asia. They were orthodox in the beginning. Certain details warrant our fixing the date of their 
composition c. 170.
<P>
5. Besides the "Acts of Peter" and the "Acts of Paul," 
we have, in revised texts, a composition entitled <i>Acts of the 
Holy Apostles Peter and Paul</i> (<font face="Symbol">PraxeiV twn agiwn apostolwn Petrou kai Paulou</font>). Originally these acts comprised an account of the journey of St. Paul to Rome, where St. Peter 
was already residing, and an account of the labors of the 
two Apostles and their martyrdom. This is the order followed by a whole series of manuscripts. Like the "Acts of 
Paul," this work is an orthodox composition, which the author wished, perhaps, to substitute for the Gnostic "Acts 
of Peter." According to Bardenhewer, they date from the 
first half of the third century.
<P>
6. The <i>Acts of the Apostle Andrew</i>, probably from the 
second half of the second century, are mentioned by Eusebius[6] and other ancient writers, who regard them as heretical. Some critics attribute them to Pseudo-Lucius. Only 
a few short citations from this work have been preserved, 
but we have in Greek, and in expurgated and revised texts 
in other languages, three principal episodes of the story 
which form the subject matter for three separate writings:
the <i>Acts of Andrew and Mathias in the town of the Anthropophagi</i>, the <i>Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Andrew</i> 
and the <i>Martyrdom of the Holy Apostle Andrew</i>.[7] The 
latter pretends to be the work of eye-witnesses, priests and 
deacons of the Churches of Achaia. In reality, it is not 
older than the fifth century.
<P>
7. The same authors who speak of the "Acts of Andrew" 
mention also <i>Acts of John</i>, of heretical origin. Innocent I 
attributed them to Pseudo-Lucius. These <i>Acts</i>, probably 
composed, as those of Andrew, in the second half of the second

century, are now almost entirely lost. A fair number 
of fragments have reached us through citations and other 
manuscripts and have enabled us to reconstruct approximately
the order of the narrative. To accomplish this work, 
orthodox recensions of a later period have been used, which 
have more or less retouched and corrected the original copy. 
Such are, in Greek, the <i>Acts of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist
John the Theologian</i>, written by his disciple Prochoros
(first half of the fifth century), and, in Latin, the 
<i>Virtutes Joannis</i>, written by Pseudo-Abdias (end of the 
sixth century), and the <i>Passio Joannis</i>, written by Pseudo-Melito (still more recent).
<P>
8. The <i>Acts of the Apostle Thomas</i> have been preserved 
better than all the Gnostic Acts of the Apostles  We have 
not, it is true, the original; but two recensions in Greek 
and Syriac have reached us, and they preserve both the 
spirit and form of the work.[8] The whole clearly shows 
Encratic tendencies. Some poetical pieces written originally
in Syriac and inserted here and there, form an integral
part of the treatise and have led the majority of 
critics to conclude that the entire work was written first in 
that language. It may have been originally composed at 
Edessa by some disciple of Bardesanes. Everything indicates
that it was written in the beginning of the third century.
<P>
9. The <i>Acts of Philip</i> (apocryphal) are first mentioned 
in a decretal of Pope Gelasius. We possess these <i>Acts</i> in 
two forms, both of orthodox origin, but of small value. 
In them there is a confusion of Philip the Apostle with 
Philip the Deacon. The Greek acts are incomplete and 
seem to have been compiled from two independent writings;
they do not date beyond the end of the fourth century. 
The Syriac acts seem still more recent.
<P>
10. The <i>Acts of Matthew</i> are not mentioned by any ancient
author; yet such a work must have existed, since we 
have in Greek the conclusion, which is an account of the 
ministry of the Apostle and his martyrdom at Myrne. The 
author of these Acts was acquainted with the "Acts of 
Mathias," which were, perhaps, called "Acts of Mathias" by 
mistake instead of "Acts of Matthew."
<P>
11. The <i>Acts of Thaddaeus</i>, who was one of the seventy-two
<P>

<P>

<P>
two disciples, were known to Eusebius, who analysed them 
partly and copied out a few extracts, notably those referring 
to the famous correspondence between King Abgar of 
Edessa and Jesus. These </i>Acts</i>, called the <i>Acta Edessena</i>,
were written first in Syriac and may date back to the first 
half of the third century. We possess, under the title of 
<i>Doctrina Addaei</i>, a Syriac recension of the work, which is 
much more elaborate and may be dated from 390-430.[9]
The Greek recension edited by Tischendorf is shorter and 
has substituted the Apostle Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus for the 
disciple Addaeus or Thaddaeus. The work is not older than 
the fifth century.

<a name="#epistles"> </a>

<h3>7. APOCRYPHAL EPISTLES</h3>
<P>
Apart from the Epistles mentioned in the Apocryphal 
Acts of the Apostles, of which they form a part, there remain
only a very small number of Apocryphal Epistles. 
The reason for this is simple. Epistolary literature is one 
in which the imagination finds little field for exercise and to 
which it is much harder to give an authentic ring.
<P>
1. Fragments, still partly unpublished, of an <i>Epistle of 
the Apostles</i>, have recently been discovered in Coptic and 
Latin. This Epistle recounts the resurrection of Our Lord 
and the deliverance of St. Peter. Harnack fixes the date of 
its composition between 150 and 180.
<P>
2. We have an <i>Epistle of St. Paul to the Laodiceans</i>[1] 
written evidently for the purpose of answering a passage in 
the "Epistle to the Colossians" (iv, 16). The most ancient 
text extant is in Latin. Both the matter and the form of 
this composition are mediocre; very probably it has nothing 
in common with the "Epistle to the Laodiceans" mentioned 
by the Muratorian Fragment. There is no sure witness of 
it before the fifth century.
<P>
3. The same Muratorian Fragment mentions an Epistle 
of St. Paul to the Alexandrians, forged by the Marcionites. 
All trace of this work has been lost.
<P>
4. We have, however, a <i>Letter of the Corinthians to St. 
Paul</i> and a (third) <i>Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians</i>, 
which originally formed part of the "Acts of Paul" and,
<P>
[9] See J. Tixeront, <i>Les Origines de l'Eglise d'Edesse et la Lcgende 
d'Abgar</i>, Paris, 1888.

<P>
like it, were written in Greek. They remain only in Latin 
and in one Armenian translation.[2] The contents of these 
letters may be summed up as follows: The Corinthians 
make known to Paul that Gnostic doctrines are creeping in 
among them. St. Paul answers, insisting strongly on the 
doctrine which he had preached to them. These letters have 
been held in great esteem by the churches of Syria and 
Armenia. Like the "Acts of Paul," they date from c. 170.
<P>
5. As to the fourteen Latin letters between Seneca and 
St. Paul (eight letters of Seneca, six of St. Paul), which 
have been preserved,[3] it is certain that they are not genuine 
and are the work of a very mediocre author. The poverty 
of thought, rough diction, and unpolished style are striking. 
Are they the same as those mentioned by St. Jerome in <i>De 
Viribus Illustribus</i> (12)? Most critics admit it and consequently
fix the date of their composition about 360-380, at 
the latest; others think they are more recent. In any case, 
they are based on the belief that relations once existed between
St. Paul and Seneca, the truth of which is in nowise 
proved. Seneca may have heard about the Christians, but 
he certainly never borrowed anything from their doctrines.

<h3>8. APOCRYPHAL APOCALYPSES</h3>
<P>
l. The <i>Apocalypse of Peter</i>, about half of which has been 
found in a manucsript of Akhmin, is mentioned in the 
Canon of Muratori and cited and even commented upon by 
Clement of Alexandria.[1] The fragment contains two 
visions, one of heaven, the other of hell. The work enjoyed
great popularity in many churches. It must have 
been composed at the latest in the middle of the second century.
<P>
<i>An Apocalypse of Peter by Clement</i>,[2] a more lengthy 
work extant in Ethiopic and Arabic, is not older than the 
VIIth or VIIIth century.

2. The passage of St. Paul's second Epistle to the Corinthians
(xii, 2 ff.) relating to his being rapt into the third 
heaven, and the mysterious words he heard there, was a 
natural inducement for some author to reveal these wonders.
St. Epiphanius[3] mentions an <i>Assumption of Paul</i>
('<font face="Symbol">Anabatikon Paulou</font>) of the second or third century, used by 
the Gnostics. We know nothing more about this book. 
But there does exist in Greek, Latin, Syriac and other recensions
(the Latin is the best), an <i>Apocalypse of Paul</i> which 
enjoyed great vogue.[4] The Apostle is represented as visiting
successively the dwelling-place of the elect, that of the 
damned, and the Garden of Eden. The work is orthodox 
and states in the introduction that it was discovered during 
the reign of Theodosius (379-395) beneath the house in 
which St. Paul lived at Tarsus, and was sent by that prince 
to Jerusalem. Traces of it first appear in Tractate xcviii, 
8, of St. Augustine on St. John (c. 416); consequently, it 
dates from the end of the fourth century and was written 
in the neighborhood of Jerusalem.
<P>
3. Besides the "Apocalypse of Paul," the decretal of 
Pope Gelasius mentions an <i>Apocalypse of Thomas</i> and an 
<i>Apocalypse of Stephen</i>. Nothing is known of this latter 
work; perhaps it has been confounded with a document of 
the fifth century on the finding of the relics of St. Stephen. 
The <i>Apocalypse of Thomas</i>, a very short work, has recently 
been found in Latin and seems to be of the fourth century 
and of Manichean provenance.[5]
<P>
4. The <i>Apocalypse of Zacharias</i>, mentioned by the catalogues
of Biblical apocrypha, may refer to the Old or to the 
New Testament. Not having the text, we do not know 
whether the Zacharias referred to is the prophet or the 
father of St. John the Baptist.
