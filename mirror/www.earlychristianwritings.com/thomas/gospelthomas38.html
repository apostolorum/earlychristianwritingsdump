'And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.',
'And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: For this peoples heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.',
'The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?',
'Moreover, when He said, "I have often desired to hear one of these words, and I had no one who could utter it," they maintain, that by this expression "one" He set forth the one true God whom they knew not.'

<p>Robert M. Grant and David Noel Freedman write: "The second-century Marcosians, according to Irenaeus (<i>Adv. haer.</i>, 1, 20, 2), quoted this saying in a slightly different form.  'Many times they desired to hear on of these words, and they had no one to tell them.'  The saying may be based on Luke 17:22: 'The days will come when you desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see.'  As usual, Thomas - or a predecessor - changes what is future in the gospels to present and past.  'The days will come' (Luke) when 'you will seek me and will not find me' (John 7:34).  Here the gospel picture of something future is retained, perhaps because to Gnosticism the eschatological emphasis of Christianity could not be entirely dropped." (<i>The Secret Sayings of Jesus</i>, p. 153-154)</p>

<p>Manichaean Psalm Book 187:28-29 states: "I have something to say, I have no one to whom to say it."</p>

<p>Acts of John 98 states: "John, there must be one person to hear these things from me, for I need one who is going to hear."</p>

<p>Cyprian in Three Books of Testimonies to Quirinius 3.29 states: "For a time will come and you will seek me, both you and those who will come after, to hear a word of wisdom and understanding, and you will not find (me)."</p>

<p>Funk and Hoover write: "In v. 1, Jesus speaks as the redeemer who has descended to earth and ascended to heaven, a scenario central to gnostic myth and speculative wisdom theology.  This saying indicates that at a very early date followers of Jesus began to think of him in higly developed mythological terms.  The judgment of the Fellows about Thom 38:1 was a unanimous black designation." (<i>The Five Gospels</i>, p. 494)</p>

<p>Gerd Ludemann writes: "Verse 1 has an approximate parallel in Matt. 13.16-17/Luke 10.23-24 (=Q).  For v. 2 cf. John 7.34.  The logion triest to cope with the absence of Jesus (v. 2) and the disciples' wish to hear the words of the living Jesus (cf. Prologue; 2; 92.1).  It fits the situation of the Thomas community well." (<i>Jesus After 2000 Years</i>, p. 609)</p>
