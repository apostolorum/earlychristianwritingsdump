'And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.',
'And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: For this peoples heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.',
'Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.',
'And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.',

<p>The one who knows these mysteries, will be able to give the world precious gifts.<br>- Peter T.</p>

<p>Reserve discussion of the mysteries for those of a like persuasion and who sit at table at one hand and for those who sit at the other hand speak to them only of the things of the mundane world --- to express it poetically. It is a conduct requirement, don't mix things up<br>- Thief37</p>

<p>"Left and right hands" are so called KAV SMOL and KAV YAMIN - parts of the soul and one of biggest mysteries in the Bible, similar to Bridegroom & Bride. The soul, who feels own left & right, will understand this half-word/metaphor.<br>- Fivetrees</p>

<p>Note: there are no words mentioning any "hands" in the Coptic text. Left and right are inner parts.<br>- Tomer</p>

<p>Left & Right are essential universal powers in our souls and Cosmos. These powers are the same as Bridegroom & Bride in NT/OT.

Saying 62  explains specific, astonishing and secret aspect of L&R. For an advanced soul it shows difference of L&R qualities and feeling (sensation). There is no way to see as a whole and control L&R together without knowledge of this aspect. The subject of L&R is an essential secret of the Bible-Torah and universal secret of the Soul in all religions and cultures (see Greek Caduceus, Indian Nadis etc.).  Ophis (serpent) of gnostic Ophites is a personification of power (inside of the soul), which balances and controls L&R, and is the only "being" able to go through paradoxes and conflicts of "two cosmic powers in heaven". The one who knows, understands, feels and controls L&R - is "above the all". And he is in an end of search.

L&R is a connection between concrete, acute praxis of everyday life and abstract theory of mysterious knowledge.

Aspects of L&R are very important (example: Mt 9:14-17) for whole understanding of logia. More on L&R "lines" see book of Baruh Ashlag "Shamati".<br>- thomas@ryterna.com</p>

<p>F. F. Bruce writes: "The first sentence is similar to the canonical saying about the disciples receiving the mystery of the kingdom of God which remains a riddle to outsiders (Mark 4.11 f.; cf. Matthew 13.11 ff.; Luke 8.10); but here the esoteric doctrine of the Gnostics is meant.  The second sentence in the canonical tradition (Matthew 6.3) enjoins secrecy in generous giving; here it forbids the spreading of the esoteric doctrine beyond the privileged circle." (<i>Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament</i>, p. 137-138)</p>
