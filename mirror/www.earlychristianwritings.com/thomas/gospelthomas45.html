Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.',
'Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.'

      <p>(45) Jesus said: Grapes are not harvested from thorn-bushes, nor are figs gathered from hawthorns, [f]or they yield no fruit.  [A go]od man brings forth good from his treasure; a bad man brings forth evil things from his evil treasure, which is in his heart, and he says evil things, for out of the abundance of his heart he brings froth evil things.      </p></td>

      <p>(45) Jesus said, "Grapes are not harvested from thorn trees, nor are figs gathered from thorn bushes, for those do not bear fruit.  Good people produce good from their store.  Evil people produce wicked things from their evil store within their hearts, and say wicked things.  For out of the heart's abundance they produce wicked things."      </p></td>

<p>Robert M. Grant and David Noel Freedman write: "From the fruits mentioned in Saying 44, Thomas goes on to give other sayings on the same subject, beginning with Matthew 7:16 then continuing with its parallel Luke 6:44-45.  Luke 6:45 is parallel to Matthew 12:35, which also puts the saying about "treasure" in the context of "saying things"; but the saying in Thomas can be explained simply on a combination of Matthew 7:16-19 with Luke 6:44-45.  The Gnostic is presumably the one who brings forth good things." (<i>The Secret Sayings of Jesus</i>, p. 157)</p>

<p>Gerd Ludemann writes: "Verses 1-3 have a close parallel in Luke 6.44b-45b and in Matt. 7.16b; 12.35; 12.34b.  The sequence grapes/figs agrees with Matt. 7.16b against Luke 6.44b (figs/grapes).  Verse 4 recalls Luke 6.45c.  As this part of the verse derives from Lukan redaction, the same thing may be presumed for the whole Thomas logion, which is to be designated a mixed quotation." (<i>Jesus After 2000 Years</i>, p. 612)</p>
