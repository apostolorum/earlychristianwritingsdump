'And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered. But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils. And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven. But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.',
'Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. Or else how can one enter into a strong mans house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.',
'And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. No man can enter into a strong mans house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.'

<p>Perhaps this passage refers to the strength of faith, as in, A person cannot change your beliefs, nor take your faith, unless they bind your hands by subduing your will.<br>- Nikole</p>

<p>One cannot change a mind or a system without first knowing what is that idea's or system's or person's power.  However, if you can find the locus of power and interupt it or defuse it, then you can change minds, people, and systems.<br>- magsvus</p>

<p>I think this refers to the fact that you cannot overcome sin while you let your desires control you. You have to tie down your senses and then you will be able to overcome this material world.<br>- Alex</p>

<p>It is impossible for someone to change your faith if it is strong.  It cannot be changed unless you are weak and allow them to control you.<br>- Meg</p>

<p>Gerd Ludemann writes: "At the level of redactoin the logion recalls 21.5-8, and at the level of tradition it strongly recalls both Mark 3.27 and Matt. 12.29/Luke 11.21-22 (= Q).  It has a genetic connection with these passages.  However, in contrast to the parallels mentioned it does not indicate the context, which there consists in the overcoming of Satan by Jesus." (<i>Jesus After 2000 Years</i>, p. 607)</p>

<p>Crossan writes: "This version is extremely close to Mark 3:27, much more than to Matt. 12:29 (against Schrage: 87).  With regard to <i>form</i>, the external format is assertion rather than question in Mark and <i>Thomas</i>, against Matthew; (b) the internal format has three sections: general negation ('not'/'no one'), specific exception ('unless'), direct result ('then'), in Mark and <i>Thomas</i>, but only the last two in Matthew.  With regard to <i>content</i>, and allowing for the syntactical and translational differences between Greek and Coptic, the main differences are that <i>Thomas</i> lacks 'his goods' and 'first' but contains 'his hands,' as against Mark.  The Coptic text is ambiguous on the object of the intruder's force: 'him (or: it)' in Guillaumont (1959:23), 'it (or: him)' in Wilson (Hennecke and Schneemelcher:1.515).  But the meaning seems to demand the translation 'take it by force,' as in Lambdin (122), and this is again close to Mark.  In summary, then, the differences between Mark and <i>Thomas</i> are performancial variations in content within a remarkably similar format." (<i>In Fragments</i>, p. 190)</p>

<p>Funk and Hoover write: "Thomas preserves this saying, like many others, without any context.  In Mark 3:27, the saying is related to the exorcism of demons.  However, that may not have been its original reference.  The Fellows gave the saying a pink rating because it is not likely to have been attributed to Jesus by the Christian community inasmuch as it is an image of violence.  Further, it is attested in three independent sources, Mark, Q, and here in Thomas." (<i>The Five Gospels</i>, p. 493)</p>
