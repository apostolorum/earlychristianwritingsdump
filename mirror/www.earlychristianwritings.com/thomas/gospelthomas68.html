'Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other mens matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.',

<p>The will of God is so opposed to the ways of most men that when a follower of Jesus' sayings finds himself  persecuted by most men, he can be sure that he is truly doing the will of God on earth.<br>- John Landers</p>

<p>Do not seek to persecute, or seek to cast your aspersions. The hearts of many men need to be relieved of this impulse. The place where men cast stones from is perilous itself. Look around & listen, you will see how easy it is for dark clouds to gather.
Forgiveness is the key, compassionate understanding is the way. Be like Jesus, not like fellow men.<br>- Owl</p>

<p>Comparing Thomas to Matthew and Luke, Koester finds that the Thomas form is more original: "The phrase 'and cast out your name as evil on account of the Son of man' is certainly Lukan; it is missing in the parallel passage Matt 5:11.  Moreover, the reference to persecution has disappeared in the Lukan redaction of this saying, but is preserved in Matt 5:11." (<i>Ancient Christian Gospels</i>, p. 89)</p>

<p>Gerd Ludemann writes: "The meaning [of v. 2] is unclear.  Is this talk of the lack of success of the ones who are acting?  But in what sense?  Perhaps it helps to note that 'place' also appears in other passages of the Gospel of Thomas (4.1; 24.1; 60.6; 64.12) and each time denotes the place of salvation.  In that case v. 2 says that the persecutors have forfeited salvation." (<i>Jesus After 2000 Years</i>, p. 625)</p>
