'After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.',
'And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.',
'In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.'

<p>Jesus is asking God to send forth workers to help with the harvest which is now beginning. What is God asking you to do?<br>- Simon Magus</p>

<p>This quote is saying that true seekers are few even when the reward is eternal life. Few are the people who long to see god face to face and who are not deluded by their own egos.<br>- unknown</p>

<p>Rabbi Tarfon in Pirke Aboth 2.20 says: "The day is short, and the work is great, and the laborers are slow, and the wages are high, and the master of the house is insistent." (<i>The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus</i>, p. 97)</p>

<p>Funk and Hoover write: "This saying evidently originated in the context of the Christian movement, at a time when missionary endeavor was a major activity.  In addition, the image of the harvest is usually associated with the threat of judgment, a theme that was not characteristic of Jesus." (<i>The Five Gospels</i>, p. 514)</p>

<p>Gerd Ludemann writes: "The logion corresponds to Matt. 9.37-38/Luke 10.2 (=Q), but does not read 'of the harvest' after 'the lord' as Matthew and Luke do.  There is no evidence of dependence on the Synoptic parallels." (<i>Jesus After 2000 Years</i>, p. 627)</p>
