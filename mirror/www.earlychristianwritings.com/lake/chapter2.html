<p>CHAPTER II
</p><p>JERUSALEM</p></center>

<p>For the history of the disciples after the death of Jesus we are dependent
upon a single source, Acts of the Apostles, which can, however, be controlled,
and to some extent corrected, by the gospels and by the epistles of Paul.
</p><p>It is now generally recognised that if any one wishes to write a life
of Christ he ought to base his work not on the gospels as we have them
now, but rather on the information provided by the critical analysis of
the gospels as to their sources. These sources, or at least the two oldest
and most important, have become well known as Mark and Q. Every one nowaday
is aware that behind Matthew and Luke is a document which was almost or
entirely identical with our Mark, and that in addition to this both Matthew
and Luke used another source, or possibly sources, to which the name of
Q is given. In general, however, there is a tendency among those who have
acquired this insight into the composition of the gospels from lectures
or from little books rather than by the study of a synopsis to attach altogether
too rigid an importance to these results.
</p><p>Mark, though a document of early date and unsurpassed value, is the
Greek edition of an earlier Aramaic tradition, probably, though not certainly,
in documentary form before it was translated. It would be a miracle if
it contained nothing due to the Greek circle in which its present form
was produced.
</p><p>Q, after all, is the name, not of an existing document,
</p><center>
<p>29</p></center>

<p>but of the critical judgement that there is a documentary source behind
material common to Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark. This critical judgement
is accepted by theologians as well as critics; but theologians, with a
distrust of criticism not wholly unjustified, frequently prefer a mechanical
to a rational application of this discovery, and dignify their preference
by calling it objective, though it is difficult to see why a process should
be regarded as objective, in any valuable sense of the word, because it
automatically accepts as derived from Q everything common to Matthew and
Luke, and leaves out all the rest. It is merely a method of canonising
the subjectivity of Matthew when it agrees with that of Luke, or of Luke
when it agrees with that of Matthew, and damning both of them when they
happen to disagree. Why the subjectivity of the editors of the gospels
becomes objective when it is accepted by modern writers is a little difficult
to see.
</p><p>The result of this concentration of attention on the value of synoptic
criticism for the life of Jesus and of the neglect of the editorial subjectivity
of the evangelists has been a general tendency to overlook the value of
the gospels as the record of the opinion of the generation which produced
them. Yet obviously there are no other documents which tell us the views
held in the early Church of the teaching and office of Christ. On this
subject they give even more information than Acts, and enable us to control
it by showing the gradual development of thought and language in the Christian
community.
</p><p>Similarly, for a slightly later period and for a different locality,
the Pauline epistles give us glimpses of the process of development—a process
by no means always peaceable—of which the results are recorded in the second
part of Acts.
</p><p>In this way the critical use of the gospels, the Acts, and Pauline epistles
enable us to trace the general outline of the early stages of the synthesis
between primitive Jewish
</p><center>
<p>30</p></center>

<p>Christianity and the spirit of Graeco-Oriental mysteries. It takes us
in succession into Jerusalem, Antioch, and Corinth, not because these were
the only churches which grew up in this period, but because it is in the
main their tradition which is preserved in the documents at our disposal.
</p><p>What was the course of events immediately after the death of Jesus?
There is no period of which the details are more obscure, but the criticism
of Mark and Acts enables us to reconstruct its general outline. The fortunate
preservation of Mark enables us to correct the narrative of Acts. If we
had Acts alone we should have no doubt but that the disciples stayed in
Jerusalem, and settled there from the time when they entered it with Jesus
on the first Palm Sunday until the day when they left it to preach to the
world outside. Mark, however, is convincing proof that Acts has omitted
a complete incident. In Mark xiv. 28 Jesus is represented as saying, "After
I am risen I will go before you into Galilee," and in Mark xvi. 7 the young
man at the tomb says, "Go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before
you into Galilee, there ye shall see him." The sequence of events clearly
implied is that the disciples after the death of Jesus went back to Galilee,
where they saw the risen Jesus. Inspired by this vision, they returned
to Jerusalem to wait for his return in triumph, and meanwhile to continue
the work which he had begun. Unfortunately the end of Mark, which undoubtedly
described the details, has disappeared, but the general sequence is as
clear as anything can be which is not definitely narrated.
</p><p>The general tenor of the narrative in Acts makes it plain that in Jerusalem
they settled down as a separate synagogue. Any ten Jews had a right to
form a synagogue of their own, and general community of interests, joined
to opinions differing from those of others, would be the natural basis
of its organisation; but it is sometimes
</p><center>
<p>31</p></center>

<p>hard for Christians, who have come to think of identity of opinion,
especially on points beyond the reach of proof, as the basis of ecclesiastical
life, to understand that Palestinian Judaism admitted the widest possible
range of thought, and that the Church of Israel rested not on uniformity
of thought, but on obedience to the Law. Naturally there was in point of
fact considerable agreement in opinion, and naturally also difference of
opinion led to quarrels and hostility; but in general the Church of Israel
in the first century was as characteristically based on uniformity of conduct
as the Christian Church in the fourth and following centuries was based
on uniformity of opinion.
</p><p>On three points this synagogue of the Nazarenes, as the disciples were
called, differed from other Jews: (1) They held the opinion that they were
inspired, at least at intervals, by the Spirit of God; (2) they followed
a special kind of communistic rule which they probably regarded as fulfilling
the teaching of Jesus; (3) they held and preached distinctive opinions
about Jesus himself.
</p><p>The opinion that the disciples were inspired by the Holy Spirit was
in some ways the keystone of Christian life. It formed a connecting link
with the authority of Jesus himself; for, whatever the later generation
of Christians may have thought, it is clear from Mark that Jesus in his
public preaching never claimed the authority of any special office or function
such as that associated with the word "Messiah" or with the title "Son
of Man," even though he may have allowed an inner ring of disciples to
believe that these were the offices to which he was entitled. Nor during
his lifetime did he even permit his followers in their preaching to ascribe
any such rank to him. The authority which he actually claimed for his words
and deeds was that of the Holy Spirit of God; and those who maintained
that he cast out demons by the power of Satan were, he said, guilty of
blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. It is probable that the gospel tradition
is trustworthy
</p><center>
<p>32</p></center>

<p>which associates his baptism at the hands of John the Baptist with his
first consciousness of this inspiration.
</p><p>Jesus, then, had claimed for himself, openly and publicly, the authority
of the Holy Spirit. There is no evidence that any of his disciples had
claimed this for themselves during his lifetime, but after his death it
seemed to them that the Spirit which had filled their Master had descended
on them, inspiring their words and guiding their actions.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>What ought to be our verdict on this claim of the first Christians?
To see the question in its true light it is necessary to distinguish between
the experience of the Christians and the opinion which they held about
it. Their opinion was that they had been taken possession of by the Spirit
of God, which was acting through them, so that their words and deeds had
the authority no longer of fallible man but of the omnipotent and infallible
God. This theory was a heritage from a distant past in Israel when the
Spirit of the Lord had been regarded as the source of all extraordinary
events, good or evil. Later, evil events had no longer been attributed
to the Spirit of the Lord, but to demons or unclean spirits who peopled
the earth and took possession of men as they found opportunity. To them
were attributed disease, misfortune, and especially the raving of madness,
while healing and prophecy were attributed to the Divine Spirit.
</p><p>In modern times we no longer attribute disease, misfortune, or madness
to devils, not because these phenomena have ceased, but because we have
a different theory of their origin, which, on the whole, produces more
satisfactory therapeutic results than the theory of possession. Similarly
the phenomena of prophecy, which the Jews ascribed to the Spirit of God,
remain. There has never
</p><p><sup>1</sup> I have discussed the story of the gift of the Spirit at
Pentecost in the <i>Earlier Epistles of St. Paul</i>, pp. 241 ff., and
have added some critical remarks on the various forms of the tradition
in the <i>Prolegomena to Acts</i>, i. 322 f.
</p><center>
<p>33</p></center>

<p>been a generation lacking in men who believe that their action and speech
are being governed by a compelling force, separate from the ordinary process
of volition. Those who have this experience seem to themselves to be, as
it were, the spectators of their own deeds, or to be listening to their
own utterances. Under its influence individuals, groups of men, or even
nations, are carried away by inexplicable waves of passion or enthusiasm
which, once aroused, cannot be resisted till their force is spent. This
consciousness has been felt in varying degree in every generation, and
the progress of humanity can never be explained unless it be taken into
account. Sometimes, in the inevitable reaction after the psychic stress
of such experiences, men have resented, doubted, or denied the validity
of their own consciousness; sometimes they have regarded it as possessing
a value exceeding all else in life. Usually those who have it attract the
hostility of their contemporaries, scarcely tempered by the allegiance
of a few followers, and their names are forgotten in a few years, but sometimes
the verdict of contemporary hatred is reversed by posterity, which endeavours
to compensate by legendary honours for the contempt and contumely of life.
</p><p>The problem presented by this experience is really twofold. It calls
for a judgement as to its origin and for a judgement as to its value, and
on neither point has there as yet been sufficiently clear discussion.
</p><p>Does the experience of controlling force which the prophet feels really
come from some external influence, or is it merely his consciousness of
ordinarily unknown depths in his own nature? It is obvious that a theory
of prophecy could be made on lines rendered familiar by psychologists,
by suggesting that what happens in a prophetic experience is the sudden
"coming up" of what is ordinarily "subliminal." It is, however, important
to remember that this is merely a modern hypothesis, just as the Jewish
view of inspiration was an ancient one. But it
</p><center>
<p>34</p></center>

<p>is impossible in a rational theology to combine fragments of two wholly
different explanations of life and of the universe. "The Spirit" was an
admirably intelligible phrase in the Jewish or early Christian view of
the universe; it does not fit in well with the modern view of the universe.
Similarly the theory of subliminal action fits very well into the modern
view, but not into that of traditional Christian theology. Preachers seem
to make a serious mistake when they try to combine the language of two
rival hypotheses to explain the same human experience.
</p><p>The judgement of value which ought to be passed on the prophets is no
clearer than the judgement of origin. The early Church knew perfectly well
that there were true prophets and false prophets,<sup>1</sup> and so did
the Jews, but in the end the only way of distinguishing them was to say
that a true prophet was a prophet who was right, and a false prophet was
a prophet who was wrong. Nor can we arrive at any different judgement.
The truth is,—and unfortunately the modern world is sometimes in danger
of forgetting it,—that the difference between right and wrong, fact and
fancy, possibility and impossibility, is inherent in the nature of things
and incapable of modification by human beings, prophets or otherwise. It
cannot be changed by the glowing utterances of poets, prophets, or preachers,
or by the unanimous votes of peoples. All that man can do is to discover
it and obey it with humility. The mere fact of discovery arouses in some
men an emotion which for the moment seems to change their being, but their
emotion does not change or increase the truth, and it may be questioned
whether in some cases it has not prevented them from seeing rightly the
value of what they have found. For the same deep emotion is sometimes caused
by error, and there are few mistakes
</p><p><sup>1</sup> I have discussed the history of early Christian attempts
to distinguish false from true prophets in "De strijd tusschen het oudste
Christendom en de bedriegers" in the <i>Theologisch Tijdschrift</i>, xlii,
395-411.
</p><center>
<p>35</p></center>

<p>more deadly than to judge the truth of what a man says, or the value
of what he does, by the emotion which he feels himself—however sincerely—or
arouses in others—however vehemently.
</p><p>The way of life which the first Christians adopted was especially marked
by an attempt to organise themselves on communistic principles. The Christians
shared all things; those who had property realised it, and pooled the proceeds
in a common fund, which was distributed to individual members as need arose.
It is impossible not to recognise in this action consistent and literal
obedience to the teaching of Jesus. The disciples had followed Jesus to
the end of his journey in Jerusalem; they were waiting for his manifestation
in glory, and sold all that they had and gave to the poor. But in terms
of political economy the Church was realising the capital of its members
and living on the division of the proceeds. It is not surprising that under
these circumstances for the moment none was in need among them, and that
they shared their food in gladness of heart, for nothing so immediately
relieves necessity or creates gladness of heart as living on capital, which
would be indeed an ideal system of economy if society were coming to an
end, or capital were not. It is probable that the Church thought that society
would soon end, but it proved to be wrong, and it is not surprising that
the same book, which in its early chapters relates the remarkable lack
of poverty among the Christians, has in the end to describe the generous
help sent by the Gentile churches to the poor brethren.
</p><p>We may, however, surmise that the breakdown of this communistic experiment
was accompanied by other difficulties in the Church. It appears that by
this time Christianity had attracted the favourable attention of a number
of Jews who belonged at least, by origin to the Diaspora, and this introduced
a new element, destined in the end to become dominant and much more objectionable
than the original disciples to the Jews of Jerusalem. We know
</p><center>
<p>36</p></center>

<p>from other sources that among the Hellenistic Jews was a tendency to
liberalism, or Hellenism. This touched the Jews where they were most sensitive,
for it affected not opinion but conduct, and seemed to threaten the destruction
of the Jewish Law. They were apparently willing to tolerate Peter and the
rest, so long as they confined themselves to holding peculiar opinions
about the Messiah, and remained perfectly orthodox in their fulfilment
of all the requirements of the Law. But when the synagogue of the Nazarenes
took to themselves Hellenists the situation became intolerable: a severe
persecution arose, Stephen was killed, and the rest of the Hellenistic
party were driven out of Jerusalem, though the original disciples remained,
for the time at least, in comparative peace. The Hellenists scattered throughout
the Gentile neighbourhood of Palestine, and their future history will have
to be considered later.
</p><p>The opinion which the disciples held of Jesus now became part of their
preaching in a manner which had not, been the case during his lifetime.
To distinguish its nature and development requires a somewhat critical
investigation of the meaning and history of the titles first used in speaking
of Jesus. The chief of these are Messiah, Son of Man, Son of God, and Servant.
That which in the end was the most important of all—Lord—was probably not
used until a little later.
</p><p>Messiah is really an adjective which, translated literally, means "anointed,"
or in Greek <i>Xpimog</i>, but whereas to say that a man was anointed has
no more meaning in Greek than it has in English, it had in Hebrew the clear
and universally understood meaning of "consecrated" or "appointed by God."
It was applied in the Old Testament to the high-priest, and it is habitually
used in this sense in the Mishna. It was also used of Saul, of David, and
of some of the other kings, but always with some defining phrase attached
to it, generally speaking "the anointed of Jehovah." Without definition
it is not found until
</p><center>
<p>37</p></center>

<p>the Christian period. There is no reason to suppose that at the beginning
of the first century it was used exclusively to describe the hope of the
Jews that a prince of the house of David would restore their fallen fortunes,
though in the later Jewish literature it was used in this way.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>Thus if we try to construct the impression which the early Christians
made on the Jews of Jerusalem by claiming that Jesus was anointed by God,
we are obliged to say that the phrase itself only implied his divine appointment;
it did not by itself indicate definitely the function to which he was appointed.
But the way in which it was used must have suggested two special functions—that
of the Davidic prince alluded to above, and that of the supernatural representative
of God who would judge the world at the last day.
</p><p>It is quite clear that the writer of Luke and Acts, and the editor of
Matthew, identified Jesus with the expected Son of David, but there is
room for doubt whether this fully represents the thought of the first disciples.
There is very little in Mark which identifies Jesus with the Son of David.
In the preaching of Jesus the Kingdom of God, so far as it was not the
divine sovereignty, was the Age to Come much more than the restored monarchy.
It is true that the people of Jerusalem seem to have been looking forward
to a Davidic king, as may be seen from the cries of the multitude at the
entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. It is also true that Bartimaeus greeted
Jesus as Son of David; but there is nothing in the recorded words of Jesus
to show that he accepted this view. It seems, therefore, probable that
just as the people were thinking of the splendours of a restored monarchy,
while Jesus was speaking of the reign of God in the Age to Come, so they
were looking for a Davidic Messiah, and
</p><p><sup>1</sup> The history of the phrase in the Old Testament and in Jewish,
literature is discussed by G. F. Moore in the <i>Prolegomena to Acts</i>,
pp. 346 ff.
</p><center>
<p>38</p></center>

<p>explained Jesus' strange and overmastering personality in accordance
with their own wishes rather than with his words. It is not the only point
at which the Church followed the leading of the people rather than the
teaching of Jesus. The figure of the Son of Man destined to be God's representative
at the day of judgement which will divide this age from the Age to Come
is prominent in the undoubted teaching of Jesus, but forms one of the most
difficult problems in New Testament criticism. There seems but little doubt
that "Son of Man," which in Greek is an unintelligible phrase rather than
a title, was quite as obscure to the generation of Greek Christians which
produced the present gospels as it is to ourselves. It was to them merely
the strange self-designation of Jesus. Probably the editors of the gospels
believed that Jesus used this phrase continually, and introduced it into
their redactions of early sources without stopping too narrowly to inquire
either whether it had this meaning in the passage in question, or whether
the way in which they were using it was consistent with the connotation
of the phrase. The result is that both in Mark and in Q there are passages
in which "Son of Man" represents an Aramaic phrase which might be translated
literally in this way, but would be idiomatically rendered "man." For instance,
it is tolerably certain that in the passage in which Jesus speaks of the
Sabbath and says, "The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath,"
he really continued, "so that man is lord also of the Sabbath," but in
unidiomatic translation the word meaning "man" was rendered "Son of Man"
and interpreted as referring to Jesus himself. The reason for saying that
this is tolerably certain is that the only alternative is that "Son of
Man" really meant "Jesus," and was intended as a reference to the "Son
of Man" who plays a part in some of the apocalypses, and it seems inconceivable
that Jesus, who forbade his disciples
</p><center>
<p>39</p></center>

<p>to tell the public that he was the Messiah, could so openly have claimed
this dignity. Discussion of the phrase "Son of Man" has been going on for
many years, and has made it increasingly clear that, apart from the unidiomatic
translations referred to above, apocalyptic usage is the most important
factor in the problem. An obscure but impressive passage in Daniel was
taken up in the Book of Enoch, which describes in the Similitudes the vision
of a Man—or in Aramaic phraseology a "Son of Man"—in heaven, who was "anointed,"
that is to say consecrated by God, to act as the judge at the end of the
age. Jesus appears to have used this expression, and to have anticipated
the speedy coming in judgement of this Man on the clouds of heaven. This
much may he regarded as agreed upon by all investigators. But the curious
and striking thing is that in none of the Marcan passages in which it is
used in this sense does it unambiguously refer to Jesus himself. No doubt
the disciples were convinced that it did, but it is therefore all the more
interesting and important that his actual words as reported by them do
not necessarily confirm their opinion. On the other hand, there is a series
of passages peculiar to Mark (that is to say, none of them is found in
Q) in which "Son of Man" does not refer to any coming in judgement, but
to the approaching passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. If he really
uttered these words, beyond doubt he meant himself by the Son of Man, and
was introducing an entirely unparalleled and new element into the delineation
of this supernatural figure. But did he use these words? In the description
of the passion, death, and resurrection it is generally recognised that
the exactness of the prediction probably owes something to the disciples'
later knowledge of the actual course of events. Their conduct at the arrest
of Jesus, and the entire absence of any sign of expectation of the resurrection,
render it very improbable that Jesus spoke with the
</p><center>
<p>40</p></center>

<p>definiteness ascribed to him. In this case, therefore, there is decided
reason for thinking that the phrase "Son of Man" may itself belong to the
embellishment rather than to the body of tradition.
</p><p>Thus the passages in which Jesus certainly uses "Son of Man" are ambiguous—they
need not necessarily refer to him, and the passages which unambiguously
refer to him were not certainly spoken by him. For this reason it is somewhat
more probable than not that the identification of Jesus with the Son of
Man was not made by Jesus himself. But it certainly embodies the earliest
opinion of the disciples concerning him, and it is in all probability to
this apocalyptic figure of the Man in heaven, predestined to judge the
world and anointed by God for that purpose, that the Marcan tradition (we
cannot, speak with certainty of Q) referred when it described Jesus as
"anointed."
</p><p>A little later the circles represented by Matthew and Luke added to
this the more popular expectation of the restored monarchy of the house
of David; but the original stamp was never lost, and the functions of the
Christian Messiah, as apart from his name, were always those of the Man
of Enoch, much more than those of the Davidic king of the Psalms of Solomon.
</p><p>Finally, the concept of the Man who was to judge the world was extensively
modified by the actual course of the passion, death, and resurrection of
Jesus, and the Lukan writings, though probably not Mark, Q, or even Matthew,
facilitated or confirmed this process by connecting the story of Jesus
with the picture given in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah of the suffering
of the righteous Servant of the Lord.
</p><p>The Servant is a comparatively common title in the Old Testament for
those who faithfully carried out the will of God; it is used of Abraham,
David, and Job among the sons of Israel, of Cyrus among the heathen, of
Israel in general, and of the righteous portion of Israel in par-
</p><center>
<p>41</p></center>

<p>ticular. In some parts, but not in all, the suffering of the Servant,
whoever he may be, is emphasised; but there is no trace in the Old Testament,
or in the later Jewish writings, that these descriptions were regarded
as predictive of the future. It was inevitable that the resemblance of
the death of Jesus to Isaiah liii. should sooner or later strike Christian
readers of the Old Testament, but it does not appear to have done so immediately,
and it is doubtful whether Isaiah liii. was the first "suffering" passage
in the Old Testament to be ascribed to him. It is more probable that the
use of the twenty-second Psalm was earlier.
</p><p>One further title of Jesus in the early Christian literature remains
to be discussed. He is referred to as Son of God. What would this phrase
mean in Jewish ears? In general the Jews regarded God as unique. The idea
of a Son of God in any physical sense, such as seemed natural enough to
the heathen world, would have been unthinkable to them, but they believed
that God himself had used the phrase metaphorically to describe the relation
between him and his chosen people. It was a moral sonship, not a physical
one in the heathen sense, or a metaphysical one in the later Christian
sense.
</p><p>In the later literature the phrase developed on two separate lines.
There was the tendency, exemplified in some of the Psalms, and still more
in the Psalms of Solomon, to use the phrase "Son of God" to describe the
Davidic king, but it was also used in quite a different sense in the Wisdom
Literature as the description of the righteous man, and especially of the
righteous man who suffered.
</p><p>In Christian literature it seems tolerably clear that the history of
the phrase passed through several stages. The latest, though in the end
the most important for the development of doctrine, is that of metaphysical
sonship, which followed upon the equation of "Son of God" with "Logos."
Somewhat earlier than this, in the early chapters of Luke, and probably
of Matthew, is an idea of sonship which
</p><center>
<p>42</p></center>

<p>approximates to the physical notion of the heathen world. Earlier still
it was probably used as a synonym for the Davidic Messiah. The question
is whether this is its meaning in the earliest passage of all,—the account
given in the first chapter of Mark of the voice from heaven at the baptism
which said, "Thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased." It is
generally held that this is a quotation from the second Psalm,<sup>1</sup>
and therefore identifies Jesus with the Davidic Messiah. But is it quite
so certain that it is a quotation from anything? The words of the Psalm
are really quite different, "Thou art my Son" instead of "Beloved Son,"
and "This day have I begotten thee" instead of "in whom I am well pleased."
Why should we suppose either that the voice from heaven was restricted
to quoting scripture, or that it did so with quite remarkable inaccuracy?
If, however, the idea be abandoned that the voice from heaven necessarily
refers to the second Psalm, it becomes an open question whether Jesus himself
regarded his divine sonship as the Davidic messiahship, or as that divine
sonship which the Book of Wisdom ascribes to the righteous. The problem
thus raised can never be settled, for the evidence is insufficient; but
neither can it be dismissed, for it is implicit in the gospel itself.
</p><p>The whole importance of this series of problems in the history of early
Christology is often strangely mistaken. It seems to many as though the
line of thought suggested above, which reduces to a vanishing point the
amount of Christology traceable, in the ordinary sense of the word, to
Jesus himself, is in some way a grave loss to Christianity. No doubt it
is a departure from orthodoxy. But if the history of religion has any clear
lesson, it is that a nearer approach to truth is always a departure from
orthodoxy. Moreover, the alternative to the view
</p><p><sup>1</sup> W. C. Allen is a noteworthy exception. See his note on
Matt. iii. 17 in the <i>International Critical Commentary</i>. See further
<i>Prolegomena to Acts</i>, pp. 397 ff.
</p><center>
<p>43</p></center>

<p>stated above is to hold that Jesus did regard himself as either one
or both of the two Jewish figures, the Davidic Messiah and the Son of Man
described in Enoch. Both of these are part of a general view of the universe,
and especially of a prognostication of the future, wholly different from
our own, and quite incredible to modern minds. How do we endanger the future
of Christianity by doubting that Jesus identified himself with figures
central in incredible and now almost universally abandoned forms of thought?
