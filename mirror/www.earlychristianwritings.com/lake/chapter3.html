<p>CHAPTER III
</p><p>ANTIOCH</p></center>

<p>According to Acts the result of the persecution of Stephen was the spread
of Christianity outside Palestine. As the narrative stands it seems to
imply that before this time there had been no Christian propaganda outside
Jerusalem. But significant details show that this impression is wrong and
merely due to the fact that the writer gives no account of the earlier
stages.
</p><p>After the death of Stephen Paul appears to have continued his persecuting
zeal, and obtained authority to go to Damascus and prosecute the Christians
resident there. Obviously, then, the Christian movement had already spread
to Damascus, but there is no hint in Acts as to how it did so. That in
so doing it had advanced beyond the limits of the Synagogue is not clear,
but Damascus was essentially a Gentile city, and the following considerations
suggest that it had done so. We know that the Jews of the Diaspora at this
period were filled with a proselytising zeal of which the fact is more
certain than the details. It is also tolerably plain from Philo that there
was a strong tendency to Hellenise and go further than orthodox Jews were
willing to tolerate. It is also certain that the outcry against the Christians
in Jerusalem which led to the death of Stephen did not start among the
native Jews but among the Hellenistsâ€”those who belonged to the synagogues
of the freedmen and of the Cyrenaeans, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and Asians,
who
</p><center>
<p>45</p></center>

<p>had synagogues in Jerusalem.<sup>1</sup> In addition to this, though
Acts suggests that the origin of the Seven was the necessity of administering
the funds of the community, it is clear that in point of fact it was their
preaching which made them prominent. Finally, it is clear from Acts that
Philip began to preach to the Gentiles as soon as he left Jerusalem, and
that some of the Cypriots and Cyrenaeans did the same.
</p><p>There is thus considerable though not overwhelming evidence that preaching
to the Gentiles began somewhat sooner than is popularly supposed, and that
before the conversion of Paul near Damascus by the vision of the risen
Lord, or before the conversion of Peter by the episode of Cornelius, there
was already a Christian mission to the Gentiles. The importance of this
is that it enables us to see the history of the early Church in a somewhat
different perspective. It shows that Paul was not the first, though he
was undoubtedly the greatest, of the Christians who preached to the Gentiles.
He was a part of Hellenistic Christianity, and probably, as will be seen
later, not the most extreme of its adherents.
</p><p>We have, then, to imagine the gradual rise of a Hellenising movement
among the Christians, of which the Seven were probably the original leaders
in Jerusalem, while unknown disciples, of whom we only know that they were
successful in Damascus, were carrying it on in other places. The Twelve
appear to have regarded the movement with doubt and suspicion, and the
Jews in Jerusalem always distinguished between the original disciples and
the Hellenists. Gradually, however, the opposition of the Twelve and their
followers crumbled away. The final defection, from the point of view of
Judaism, was that of Peter. To judge from Acts he had undertaken a mission
in Palestine, following up the work of Philip and probably
</p><p><sup>1</sup> It is probable that Paul was at this time settled in Damascus
rather than Jerusalem. If so, which synagogue in Jerusalem did he frequent?
That of the Cilicians as a native of Tarsus?
</p><center>
<p>46</p></center>

<p>of others, but the story brings to notice one of the characteristic
weaknesses of Acts as history. It always omits or minimises differences
of opinion and quarrels among Christians. We know this by comparing the
Epistles with the Acts. It is therefore perfectly legitimate to suppose
that there may well have been far more friction at first between the Hellenist
missionaries and the Twelve than Acts suggests. But in the end Peter had
a vision at Joppa which convinced him that he was wrong, and he accepted
Cornelius as a brother Christian. Acts would have us understand that the
whole Church at Jerusalem accepted Peter's position, but in view of the
Judaistic controversy, which continued to rage much later than this time,
it is certain that this is not in accordance with fact. It is significant
that soon after this Peter was put in prison, and on his escape from prison
left Jerusalem.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>From this time on, if not before, the undoubted head of the Church in
Jerusalem was James, the brother of the Lord. What was his attitude towards
the Hellenising Christians? Acts would have us understand that he was always
on perfectly good terms with Peter, and later on with Paul. But that is
hardly the impression given by the Pauline epistles, which very clearly
distinguish Peter from James and his emissaries. Paul's view is that Peter
was in principle on the same side as himself, and that he therefore had
no right to yield to the representatives of James; but he never suggests
that James and he were on the same side. Nor had the Jews in Jerusalem
any illusions on the subject; when Paul appeared in the temple he was promptly
arrested, but not until the popular madness of the year 66 did any of the
orthodox Jews think of interfering with James, the head of the Christians
in Jerusalem.
</p><p>Thus Acts plainly has understated the amount of controversy between
the Hellenising Christians and the origi-
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Unless this story is misplaced and ought to come before
Acts ix. 32.
</p><center>
<p>47</p></center>

<p>nal community. Failure to see this is due to the ultimately complete
triumph of the Hellenistic party, who naturally looked on what was really
the conservative position as Judaising, whereas the truth was that they
themselves were Hellenising. According to Acts the most successful centre
of Hellenistic Christianity was Antioch. Here, too, it is possible that
the picture presented by it is one-sided, owing to the fact that, at least
in many places, Acts reproduces the tradition of Antioch. Doubtless there
were other centres equally important. Neither Ephesus nor Rome seems to
have been founded by missionaries from Antioch, though Paul and the other
Antiochean missionaries came into their history at an early date.
</p><p>The controversy between the school of James and the Hellenistic Christians
appears to have been very acute in Antioch, but the details are extremely
obscure. Acts represents the beginning of the Church at Antioch as due
to Hellenistic Christians who left Jerusalem after the death of Stephen.
Nor is there any reason to doubt the correctness of this tradition, which
is probably that of Antioch itself. A little later Barnabas came down from
Jerusalem to Antioch. Acts does not state, but seems to imply, that he
came down, as Peter had come to Samaria, in order to criticise and control
Hellenistic enthusiasm. But, like Peter at Caesarea, he was converted by
the Hellenists, and stayed to help their mission. He went further than
this: hearing apparently of the success of Paul at Tarsus he sent for him
and co-opted him into the service of the Church at Antioch. It is worth
noting in passing that the complete absence of any details as to Paul's
work in Tarsus, and the silence concerning his movements from the time
he left Jerusalem soon after his conversion, proves that this part of Acts
is an Antiochean rather than a Pauline tradition. Soon after this more
missionaries arrived from Jerusalem. They do not appear to have been active
propa-
</p><center>
<p>48</p></center>

<p>gandists, but brought with them a sad story of approaching destitution
in the famine which was at hand. The Church at Antioch rose to the necessity
and sent Paul and Barnabas with relief.<sup>1</sup> Acts tells us nothing
more of what happened, but that soon after Paul and Barnabas, having returned
to Antioch, started on the "First Missionary Journey."<sup>2</sup> On their
return, however, a mission of protest against their methods arrived from
Jerusalem. Paul, Barnabas, and some others went up to Jerusalem; a meeting
of the representatives of the two churches was held, and an amicable agreement
which was in the main a triumph for Antioch was arrived at.<sup>3</sup>
</p><p>This appears to be Paul's third visit to Jerusalem after his conversion;
but this raises difficulties, and has led to considerable critical investigation
and not a little controversy. It had always been supposed that this visit
of Paul to Jerusalem was identical with that described in the second chapter
of Galatians, but in that chapter Paul, calling God to witness that he
is not lying, makes a statement which loses all its point if it was not
his second visit. Various attempts to explain this difficulty have been
made. One solution of the problem is that the visit to Jerusalem described
in Galatians ii. is not identical with that of Acts xv., but is an episode
connected with the visit in the time of the famine relief, which the writer
of Acts had either not known or thought it unnecessary to recount.<sup>1</sup>
According to this theory the visit described in Acts xv. took place after
the visit in Galatians had been written. But this theory does not answer
the difficulty that the apostolic decrees are not mentioned in the Epistles
to the Corinthians, and that it is incredible that they could have been
overlooked by Paul if the account in Acts xv. were
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Acts xi. 27 ff.
</p><p><sup>2</sup> Acts xii. 25-xiv. 28.
</p><p><sup>3</sup> Acts xv.

Earlier Epistles of St. Paul</i>, pp. 274 ff.
</p><center>
<p>49</p></center>

<p>wholly correct. It seems better to accept the suggestion that the solution
of the problem is to be found in the source-criticism of Acts.
</p><p>The source-criticism of Acts has passed through three more or less spasmodic
stages.<sup>1</sup> The first was early in the nineteenth century when
a number of scholars endeavoured to analyse the book. Their efforts were
not very successful, though they unearthed a great many interesting phenomena.
Later on, in the 'nineties, another series of efforts were made with, on
the whole, even less success than before. Finally, in our own time there
have been some interesting suggestions by Harnack, Schwartz, and Torrey.<sup>2</sup>
</p><p>The last named has shown extremely good reason for thinking that there
is an Aramaic source behind the first fifteen chapters of Acts.<sup>3</sup>
He is less convincing when he tries to prove that this was a single document,
and that it was faithfully translated without addition or change by the
editor of Acts. It seems more probable that there was more than one Aramaic
source, and that it was often changed and interpolated by the editor.
</p><p>Harnack skillfully tries to distinguish two main lines of tradition,
that of Antioch and that of Jerusalem. He
</p><p><sup>1</sup> The most important names in the first period are Konigsmann,
Schleiermacher, Gfrorer, and Schwanbeck, especially the last; in the second
period B. Weiss, Wendt, Sorof, Jiingst, J. Weiss, Spitta, Clemen, Hilgenfeld.
In general the work of this group is inferior in value to that of their
predecessors. A clear and invaluable summary of both is given by W. Heitmuller
in the <i>Theologische Rundschau</i> for 1899, pp. 47 ff.
</p><p><sup>2</sup> Perhaps Norden's name should be added, but interesting
and stimulating though his book <i>Agnostos Theos</i>be, it suffers from
ignorance of early Christianity, and has little permanent value for the
criticism of Acts.

Lukas</i>; E. Schwartz, "Zur Chronologie des Paulus," in the <i>Oottinyische
Nachrichtm</i>, 1907, pp. 263 ff.; C. C. Torrey, "The Composition and Date
of Acts," in the <i>Harvard Theological Studies</i>, i. The most damaging
criticism of Torrey is that of F. C. Burkitt in the <i>Journal of Theological
Studies</i>, Oct. 1919, but I do not think that he answers Torrey's case.
</p><center>
<p>50</p></center>

<p>also thinks the Jerusalem tradition existed in two forms, which can
be distinguished as doublets in Acts i.-v. He attaches Acts xv. to the
tradition of Antioch, but it seems more probable that it belongs to the
Jerusalem tradition. The truth may be as follows: soon after the time when
Barnabas had gone over to the Hellenistic party another body of Christians
from Jerusalem came to Antioch. In the years which followed there grew
up two traditions of what happened next. The tradition at Antioch was that
the Christians from Jerusalem had been chiefly concerned with the physical
necessities of their Church, though they were undoubtedly men possessed
of a prophetic gift. They had so worked on the sympathy of Antioch that
it had accepted the needs of the poor saints in Jerusalem as a responsibility
laid on it by heaven. This tradition is preserved in a short form in Acts
xi., and in the Epistle to the Galatians Paul energetically sustained its
correctness, incidentally mentioning some other events connected with his
stay at Jerusalem, the perversion of which, as he maintained, had given
rise to the tradition of Jerusalem. This latter tradition the editor of
Acts had found preserved in the document which he has used as the basis
of Acts xv., and if any one will read Galatians ii. alongside of Acts xv.,
not in order to see how much they agree or differ, but rather to note how
far they might be different accounts of the same series of events, he will
see that Paul's chief contention is that he only saw the leaders of the
community at Jerusalem in private, and that they at no time succeeded in
imposing any regulations on him. The vigour of his protestations seems
to indicate that his opponents had maintained that the meeting was an official
one, and that it had imposed regulations, namely, should the theory which
is being suggested be correct, the Apostolic Decrees.
</p><p>The two traditions are naturally quite contradictory; but human nature
is so constituted that it is not impossible for two sets of people, especially
after some lapse of
</p><center>
<p>51</p></center>

<p>time, to give entirely different accounts of the same events and to
do so in perfectly good faith. The editor of Acts, however, did not realise
that the two traditions referred to the same event, and made a mistake
in thinking that the meeting which he found described in the Jerusalem
source came after and not before the first missionary journey. Ed. Schwartz
goes further. He points out that the first missionary journey follows the
account of the meeting in Jerusalem given in Acts xi., and that the second
journey follows the account given in Acts xv. If there was really only
one meeting, was there not really only one journey, which the editor of
Acts, or his sources, converted into two?
</p><p>However this may be, and no agreement among critics is ever likely to
be reached, it is at least certain that there was considerable friction
between Jerusalem and Antioch, and that Antioch wholly refused to accept
the dictation of Jerusalem. On the contrary, it undertook wide-reaching
missions, of one of which Paul became the leader, founding churches in
Galatia, Asia, and Achaea. Of his career we have an obviously good account,
so far as the sequence of events is concerned, in the second part of Acts,
and some interesting sidelights on its difficulties and trials in the Pauline
epistles.
</p><p>What were the main characteristics of the preaching to the Gentiles
which thus found a centre in Antioch? Its basis was the intellectual heritage
from Jerusalem which made the Christians teach that the God of the Jews
was the only true God, and that Jesus had been appointed by him as the
Man who would judge the world at the end of the age. This represents the
teaching in Marcan tradition as to the Son of Man, but Paul also accepted
the view that Jesus was the Son of David, though he seems to have eliminated
the purely national character of the expected restoration of the kingdom
of the Jews under a Davidic king.
</p><p>The only complete evidence as to the exact form of the
</p><center>
<p>52</p></center>

<p>expectation which played a part in the teaching of Paul, and presumably
in that of the Church of Antioch as a whole, is the invaluable description
given in the Epistles<sup>1</sup> of the sequence of events to which Paul
looked forward. According to this he expected that Jesus would come on
the clouds of heaven; Christians who had died would be raised up, and the
rest would be changed, so that they would no longer consist of flesh and
blood, but of spirit. But, just as in 4 Ezra, the reign of the Messiah
is limited; a time will come when he will deliver up his dominion to God.
Then comes "the End," and Paul takes the picture no further. Is it too
much to suppose that, like 4 Ezra, he thought that at the End the whole
of the present order would cease, and that after it would come the general
resurrection and judgement, to which he frequently alludes, followed by
the life of the Age to Come? In any case the idea of the limited reign
of the Messiah, and the increased emphasis on the descent of Jesus from
David, are points of contact with 4 Ezra, and thus make it increasingly
possible that Paul thought that the resurrection of Christians to life
would be separate from the final resurrection of all to judgement.
</p><p>This original Christian teaching was essentially Jewish, but much of
the phraseology in which it would have been expressed by Jews must have
been unintelligible to Greek ears. It therefore soon either disappeared
or was transformed. The Kingdom of God, for instance, is as rarely mentioned
in the Pauline epistles as it is frequent in the earliest part of the gospels.
The word "Christ," translating the Hebrew adjective "anointed," was entirely
unintelligible to Greek ears, and became a proper name. "Son of Man" or
"Man" would have been even more unintelligible; Paul never used "Son of
Man," and it is doubtful whether he uses the word "Man" in the technical
apocalyptic sense. But though the words were unintelligible the ideas had
not disappeared. The functions
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Especially 1 Cor. xv. and 1 Thess. iv.
</p><center>
<p>53</p></center>

<p>attributed to the Son of Man in the gospels still remain attributed
to Jesus in the Pauline epistles, though they are scarcely so much emphasised.
</p><p>The Antiochean missionaries seem to have adopted a new word to take
the place of the unintelligible "Messiah" and "Son of Man," and called
Jesus "Lord." It is made tolerably certain by comparing the oldest strata
of the gospels with the more recent that this word was not used in Jerusalem
or in Galilee as a title of Jesus. It may have been used occasionally in
Aramaic-speaking circles, but it became dominant in Greek. Its extreme
importance is that it was already familiar to the Greek-speaking world
in connection with religion. It had become the typical title for the God
of one of the Graeco-Oriental cults which offered private salvation<sup>1</sup>
to individuals. It was therefore inevitable that whatever the Jews may
have meant when they called Jesus Lord, their Greek converts interpreted
it in the sense in which the word had become familiar to them, and thought
in consequence that Jesus was the divine head of a cult by which each individual
might obtain salvation. The full importance of this became obvious in a
purely Greek centre such as Corinth, but the process began in Antioch.
</p><p>This change in the significance attached to Jesus had its correlative
effect on the position which the Christians ascribed to themselves. They
came inevitably to regard themselves as the members of a new cult which
was superior to all others. Only by joining their number was salvation
to be found. In this sense they began to interpret the phrase "Kingdom
of God," which in many parts of the gospels very obviously means the Christian
Church. Few things, however, are more certain than that Jesus had no intention
of founding a new society outside the Jewish Church, and none of these
passages can with any probability be ascribed to him, even though at least
one
</p><p><sup>1</sup> See p. 58.
</p><center>
<p>54</p></center>

<p>can, on mechanical grounds, make out a fair case for inclusion in Q.
</p><p>A correlative change was introduced into the attitude adopted towards
the Old Testament. The Antiochean Christians refused to accept it as an
obligatory law of conduct; but more and more was it interpreted as prophetic
of Jesus, and not only of him but also of the Christian Church. In this
way everything that was said of ancient Israel, and all the promises made
to it, were transferred to the Christians, who claimed that they, and not
the Jews, were the ancient People of God. The complete fulfilment of this
process did not, it is true, take place in the time of Paul, but it was
not long in coming, and even in the epistles there are many places which
show that the Christians regarded themselves as the true heirs of the promise.
</p><p>This transference of the Jewish scriptures to the Christian Church was
probably almost as important for the future history of Christianity as
the change which made Jesus the centre of a cult offering private salvation,
instead of the prophetic herald of the Kingdom of Heaven, destined by God
to be his representative at the End of the Age. It meant that Christianity
shared with Judaism the advantage, which no other religion in the Empire
had, of being a religion with a Book. Nevertheless the obvious fact that
the Book was not originally Christian was destined in the long run to lead
to considerable difficulty. Though the Old Testament is not always susceptible
of the meaning given to it by Jewish rabbis, it is essentially a Jewish
book, and the attempt to find in it a series of prophecies foretelling
the coming of Jesus was radically wrong. It could not be supported by any
straightforward interpretation, which gave to the Old Testament its original
historical meaning. The result was the inevitable growth of an unnatural
symbolical interpretation which had little difficulty in extracting anything
from anything. It is difficult to estimate whether the result has been
more good or evil. It produced good, in that it very soon neces-
</p><center>
<p>55</p></center>

<p>sitated the growth of a Christian canonâ€”the New Testament added to the
Oldâ€”and this preserved much great literature for the advantage of future
generations, and was a check upon extravagances of thought. Perhaps most
important of all, it provided an ethical standard which successive generations
of Christians have never succeeded in practising. They have indeed frequently
tried to explain away the contrast between their scriptures and their deeds
when it became too oppressive, but they have never quite succeeded, or
been able entirely to satisfy themselves by these methods: the letter of
scripture has constantly remained a salutary protest against the interpretation
put upon it. All this has been of enormous advantage for the Christian
Church. But on the other hand the infallibility ascribed to the Bible has
been an easy weapon for obscurantism, and a drag on intellectual progress.
It has prevented the Church from adopting the discoveries of science and
criticism in such a way as to make them applicable to religious life. Bible
Christianity<sup>1</sup> in some of its more recent forms has become a
serious danger, and in moments of depression a student is apt to ask whether
in the irony of history the Bible, which strengthened and supported the
Church in its early history, and helped it in many generations to moral
reformation, is destined to become an instrument for preventing the adaptation
