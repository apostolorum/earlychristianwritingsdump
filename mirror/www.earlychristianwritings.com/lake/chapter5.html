<p>CHAPTER V
</p><p>ROME AND EPHESUS</p></center>

<p>Corinth as portrayed in the Epistles of Paul gives us our simplest and least 
  contaminated picture of the Hellenic Christianity which regarded itself as the 
  cult of the Lord Jesus, who offered salvation—immortality—to those initiated 
  in his mysteries. It had obvious weaknesses in the eyes of Jewish Christians, 
  even when they were as Hellenised as Paul, since it offered little reason for 
  a higher standard of conduct than heathenism, and its personal eschatology left 
  no real place for the resurrection of the body. The Epistles of Paul to the 
  Corinthians are in the main protests against this Hellenic weakness, and the 
  real monument to Paul in the first two, or perhaps even four, centuries is the 
  success which he had in driving home these protests. Owing to later controversies 
  we are apt to treat Justification by Faith as Paul's greatest contribution to 
  the Church. Possibly that is true, if the whole of Church history be taken into 
  account, but the attempt to reconstruct "Paulinism" on this principle produces 
  the result that the effect of Paul's teaching cannot be traced in any of the 
  Christian writings of the next two centuries. This is obviously absurd: if Paul's 
  writings were preserved so carefully his teaching on some great points must 
  have been regarded as central. Nor, if we succeed in forgetting the emphasis 
  introduced by later controversies, is it hard to see what these points were. 
  As against the Jews, Paul, the Greek, insisted on Freedom from the Law. That 
  stood. As against the Greek, Paul insisted on Jewish morality and on the Res-
</p><p align="center">76
</p><p>urrection of the body. These also stood. And these three points, if we may 
  judge from subapostolic writings, were those which influenced the Church most. 
  No doubt Paul preached Jesus as the crucified but risen and glorified Lord, 
  and no doubt regarded Baptism and the Eucharist as sacraments, but so did all 
  Hellenic Christians. Probably he would have regarded his doctrine of Faith and 
  Justification as of primary importance, but all the existing evidence seems 
  to show that it failed to convince the Jews, or to be remembered by the Gentiles, 
  until it was rediscovered by Augustine. 
</p><p>Sacramental Christianity with an emphasis on morality was henceforward
the true characteristic of the Church. But it had yet to give a more detailed
account of the Lord, and to attempt to come to terms with Greek philosophy.
</p><p>Except with regard to the Second Coming, the Jewish ideas of the Davidic
Messiah and of the Son of Man ceased to have any living importance. It
was not doubted that the Lord was divine, but there were two ways of considering
his divinity. One was to regard Jesus as a man who had been inspired by
the Holy Spirit, and had himself been taken up into the sphere of divinity
after his death, so that he, as well as the spirit which had been in him,
was now divine. This form of thought is generally known as Adoptionism.
The other way was to think of Jesus as a pre-existent divine being who
had become human.
</p><p>The difference between the two forms of thought is that whereas Adoptionism 
  postulates a distinct human personality for the human Jesus, which had a beginning 
  in time and was promoted to divinity, the other theory postulates only a divine 
  person who became human. Both theories, therefore, begin with much the same 
  doctrine of God, as consisting, if the metaphor may be used, of the two factors 
  of the Father and the Spirit, who was
</p><center>
<p>77</p></center>

<p>sometimes called his Son,<sup>1</sup> and was frequently identified
with the Logos of the Greek philosophers. There is very little evidence
in early Christian writings for that distinction between the Logos and
the Spirit which afterward became orthodox.
</p><p>The competing existence of Adoptionist and Pre-existent Christology
does much to explain the early development of the doctrine of the Trinity.
Starting with the Father and the Spirit-son, Adoptionism added a third
to the sphere of divinity, namely, the glorified Jesus. This belief was
preserved in the baptismal formula of the Church of Rome, as found in Justin
Martyr, which was "In the name of the Father of all, and in the name of
Jesus Christ who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of
the Holy Spirit," and though Adoptionism was in the end rejected, it left
its permanent mark on Christian theology in the "threeness"<sup>2</sup>
of the doctrine of God. The doctrines of Pre-existent Christology could
scarcely have had this result,<sup>3</sup> for it is quite clear that the
Logos and the Spirit were distinguished only in language, and the Incarnation
was, as it were, but an incident in the work of the Logos.
</p><p>Few things are more needed than study of this side of the growth of Christian 
  doctrine. Harnack's <i>History of Doctrine</i> has indeed done something, but 
  many of the details of his work require to be worked out, and some of his statements 
  need revision.<sup>4</sup> Older books, such as Dorner's <i>History of the Doctrine 
  of the Person of Christ</i>,
</p><p><sup>1</sup> This proves that this form of thought is not Semitic; had
it been so, the Spirit would scarcely have been masculine.
</p><p><sup>2</sup> It would be unfair and misleading to say the doctrine of
the Trinity. That doctrine is not the statement of the "threeness" of God,
but of the relation which this bears to his unity.
</p><p><sup>3</sup> No doubt the "threeness" was emphasized by the habit of
three immersions in baptism, whatever the origin of this practice may be,
and by philosophic reflections as to the properties of triangles such as
are found in Philo.
</p><p><sup>4</sup> Illuminating suggestions can be found in F. C. Conybeare's <i>The 
  Key of Truth</i> and in H. Usener's <i>Weihnachtsfest</i>. 
</p><p align="center">78
</p><p>admirable though they are, have little value for this purpose, for they were 
  written chiefly with the object of explaining and leading up to Nicene and Chalcedonian 
  doctrine. All that can be done in these pages is to indicate certain lines, 
  which might be profitably followed up, as to the two chief centres of development, 
  Rome and Ephesus, the former representing in the main Adoptionism and the latter 
  Pre-existent Christology. 
</p><p>After Antioch Rome seems to have been the most important centre of Christianity 
  in the first and early second centuries. Certainly it was more important than 
  Corinth, though in some ways, owing to the preservation of Paul's correspondence, 
  we know more about Corinth than Rome. Fortunately there are extant a number 
  of documents which illustrate its history, though none of them throw any real 
  light on its foundation, for it is unknown who was the founder of the Church 
  in Rome. 
</p><p>The first of these documents is Paul's Epistle to the Romans, but it
is very strange how little this tells us as to the history or nature of
the Church in that city. Apparently Paul was acquainted with Christians
in Rome before he went there himself, but there is no suggestion that he
regarded the Church there as the foundation of Peter or of any other of
the leading missionaries. It is therefore by no means impossible that the
Church of Rome sprang up by the coming to the city in increasing numbers
of men who had been converted elsewhere. Whether the Epistle to the Romans
was originally intended for that city or not is an open question,<sup>1</sup>
but at least it was sent to Rome in one of its forms, and that is after
all the most
</p><p><sup>1</sup> In the <i>Earlier Epistles of St. Paul</i>, pp. 335 ff. (especially 
  p. 368), I suggested that the shorter recension of the Epistle to the Romans, 
  the existence of which is proved by the evidence of the Latin <i>breves</i>, 
  Tertullian, Cyprian, and Marcion, and by the textual confusion surrounding the 
  final doxology, may be the same as that which omits all mention of Rome, and 
  that, if so, it was probably written originally for some other destination. 
  This suggestion has met with little approbation from critics, but with even 
  less discussion. I still think that it is worth consideration.
</p><p align="center">79
</p><p>important fact. The most remarkable thing about the revelation which it makes 
  of the Christianity at Rome is that the problems which seem to have interested 
  or distracted the Church are so much more Jewish than Hellenic. The questions 
  of the Law and of the ultimate fate of Israel are so extensively dealt with 
  as to suggest a strongly Jewish element in the Church. Jesus is, as in Corinth, 
  a Redeemer, but the problems of life for those who accepted him suggest Jewish 
  rather than Greek antecedents. 
</p><p>What is the bearing of Romans on the Christology of the Church at Rome? Not, 
  that is to say, what is its evidence as to the thought of Paul, but how are 
  certain phrases in it likely to have been interpreted? The most important passage 
  is Romans i. 1-4: "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated 
  to God's gospel which He had promised beforehand by His prophets in Holy Scriptures 
  concerning His Son, who became of the seed of David according to the flesh, 
  who was appointed Son of God miraculously according to the spirit of holiness 
  by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."<sup>1</sup> What is this 
  likely to have meant to those who read it in Greek without any knowledge of 
  a "Pre-existent" Christology? I think that they would have been impressed by 
  the parallelisms in the sentence: <font face="Symbol">kata sarka </font>is parallel 
  to <font face="Symbol">kata pneuma agiwsunhV </font>and <font face="Symbol">ek 
  spermatoV Daueid </font>is parallel to <font face="Symbol">ex anastasewV nekrwn</font>. 
  It would thus mean that Jesus had been a human being by belonging to the family 
  of David, and had been ordained, or appointed to be a "Spirit of holiness," 
  by being raised from the dead: <font face="Symbol">kata sarka </font>explains 
  the result of <font face="Symbol">genomenou ek spermatoV Daueid</font>, and 
  <font face="Symbol">kata pneuma agiwsunhV </font>explains the result of <font face="Symbol">orisqentoV 
  uiou . . . ex anastasewV nekrwn</font>. That is Adop-
</p><p><sup>1</sup> <font face="Symbol">PauloV douloV Ihsou Cristou klhtoV apostoloV

  Cristou tou kuriou umwn.</font>
</p><p align="center">80
</p><p>tionism, and though the passage has been explained in terms of a pre-existent 
  Christology by those who for other reasons are convinced that this was the real 
  nature of Paul's doctrine, it could be taken quite easily in this Adoptionist 
  way, for <font face="Symbol">orisqentoV </font>could mean "became by means of 
  appointment" quite as well as <font face="Symbol">afwrismenoV </font>could mean 
  the same thing with regard to Paul's apostleship.<sup>1</sup> The general impression 
  made by the verse would be, to any one who had Adoptionist views already, that 
  Jesus, who was born as a human being into the family of David (which gave him 
  a certain well-understood claim to the title Son of God), had by the Resurrection 
  been promoted to another kind of sonship, not as a human being of flesh, but 
  as a spiritual being. 
</p><p>The next document in probable chronological order which seems to
belong to Rome is the Epistle to the Hebrews. It is much disputed by critics
whether it was written in Rome or to Rome, but that it was extant there
can hardly be doubted in view of the extensive quotations from it in the
Epistle of Clement. It reveals a different mind from that of the Epistle
to the Romans, but once more it is Jewish questions which are uppermost.
The main problem is the meaning of the ritual law. Nevertheless, as in
Romans, there are sufficient traces of sacramental teaching to make it
clear that Christianity in Rome as in Corinth meant the sacramental cult
of a saving Lord. This was the basis of everything, but the problems which
arose from the attempt to work out its implications are as markedly Jewish
in Rome as they are Greek in Corinth. It does not mean, of course, that
there were no Greeks in Rome, any more than that there were no Jews in
Corinth, but the dominating influence was Jewish in one and Greek in the
other.
</p><p><sup>1</sup> The justification for assuming that the Church at Rome probably 
  had Adoptionist proclivities is the undeniable fact that early in the second 
  century Hermas held this view, and there is no evidence that he was an innovator.
</p><p align="center">81
</p><p>The Epistle to the Hebrews seems at first to be much more obviously "Pre-existent" 
  in its Christology than the Epistle to the Romans, indeed it could well be explained 
  on the theory that it was maintaining a Pre-existent Christology against a rival 
  form of the same general type which identified the pre-existent Christ with 
  an angel. But if one ask whether this would have been clear to a reader with 
  Adoptionist principles, it can be seen that he would very easily have interpreted 
  it in accordance with his own ideas. The question of what the Son of God was 
  before the Incarnation is not the centre of the discussion. What is important 
  is the function of High Priest in Heaven which he now fulfills, and this function 
  is the consequence of his human life. It is true that in the first chapter there 
  are phrases which are most naturally explained by "pre-existent" doctrine, but 
  though the writer appears to be explaining the essential superiority of the 
  Son to angels, in chapter ii. this superiority is the result of the Passion 
  and Resurrection, and in verse 10 the divine being, "through whom and for whom 
  are all things," is distinguished from the leader of our salvation, who is, 
  of course, Jesus.<sup>1</sup> It is plain that this verse, difficult to understand 
  on other lines of thought, is quite intelligible if it be interpreted in the 
  light of that Adoptionism which, as we know from Hermas, used "Son of God" for 
  the Holy Spirit and also for the glorified Jesus. 
</p><p>It is very hard not to discuss this question as though Adoptionism and Pre-existent 
  Christology were consciously competing systems from the beginning. That is of 
  course not true: none of these writers was consciously discussing the question. 
  For this reason elements can be 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> <font face="Symbol">Eprepen gar autw di on ta panta kai di ou 
  ta panta pollouV uiouV eiV doxan agagonta ton archgon thV swthriaV autwn dia 
  paqhmatwn teleiwsai</font>. The English translators take <font face="Symbol">agagonta 
  </font>as referring to the same person as <font face="Symbol">autw</font>, but 
  it seems grammatically preferable to construe it as a qualification of <font face="Symbol">archgon.</font>
</p><p align="center">82
</p><p>found in the Epistle to the Romans and in the Epistle to the Hebrews which 
  are easily susceptible of an Adoptionist interpretation, and others equally 
  indicative of Pre-existent Christology. This means that Christians at that moment 
  had not formulated the problem. But <i>The Shepherd</i> of Hermas shows that 
  in Rome an important body of Christians did become wholly Adoptionist, and if 
  they used Romans and Hebrews, they probably interpreted the passages indicated 
  above in agreement with their own opinions and passed over the rest—in accordance 
  with the best tradition of Biblical commentators.
</p><p>A third document is the first Epistle of Peter. If this were really written 
  by Peter it cannot be much later in date than Romans, and would probably be 
  earlier than Hebrews, but it seems increasingly clear that the Epistle refers 
  to a later period, and cannot be the work of the Apostle. It is concerned in 
  the main with the problem of persecution, and though the matter is extremely 
  obscure, on the whole a date early in the second century in the time of Trajan 
  and Pliny seems the most likely. Whether the indications that it comes from 
  Rome are not part of the fiction of its authorship is at least open to question, 
  but the point is not very important. If it be really Roman it shows traces of 
  a further development of sacramental Christianity, but does not throw much light 
  on its details. It has some similarity in language to Romans, but very little 
  in the picture presented of Christianity. The central point in it is the emphasis 
  on baptismal regeneration, which gives Christians the certainty of immortality. 
  The eschatological expectation of the "revelation of Jesus Christ" is strongly 
  marked, but there is no emphasis on the hope of resurrection. On one point, 
  however, there is a close resemblance to Paul. Spirit and flesh are contrasted, 
  and it is clearly implied that after death the Christian, like the Christ, is 
  spirit and not flesh. It throws little light on the question, of Adoptionism, 
  for though there is nothing in it which contradicts Pre-exist-
</p><p>83
</p><p>ent Christology, there is also nothing in it which would have startled an Adoptionist.
</p><p>After this<sup>1</sup> comes the first Epistle of Clement, a letter sent by 
  the Church of Rome to the Church at Corinth. It is generally dated at the end 
  of the first century, but there is really very little evidence, and it is curious 
  that this date should be accepted with so little hesitation by almost all critics. 
  It is in the main an ethical treatise, more especially on the importance of 
  good order in the community. This teaching is based almost exclusively on the 
  Old Testament. 
</p><p>There is very little in 1 Clement which throws any light on Christology or 
  on sacraments. For the history of doctrine, in fact, 1 Clement is, considering 
  its length, a remarkably disappointing document, but two passages are important. 
  In 1 Clement xlii., "The Apostles received the Gospel for us from the Lord Jesus 
  Christ, Jesus the Christ was sent from God," there is a clear statement of the 
  supernatural claims of the apostles, but made in such a way as to imply a lower 
  view of Christ than Nicene orthodoxy: he is the middle term between God and 
  the apostles, and is separated from the one as clearly as from the other. The 
  "Lord" is more than man, but is not God. The excellence of the Lord is also 
  expressed in 1 Clement xxxvi., in words reminiscent of Hebrews. "This is the 
  way" (i.e. the way referred to in Psalms l. 23, "The sacrifice of praise shall 
  glorify me, and therein is a way in which I will show him the salvation of God") 
  "beloved, in which we found our salvation, Jesus Christ, the high priest of 
  our offerings, the defender and helper of our
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Though, if the late date for 1 Peter be accepted, 1 Clement is 
  the earlier document. But the chronology of 1 Clement seems to me less certain 
  than it is usually held to be. It depends on two factors, both doubtful: (1) 
  the chronology of the list of Roman bishops in Eusebius and in the <i>Liber 
  Pontificalis</i>; (2) the supposed reference in the epistle to the alleged persecution 
  under Domitian. Against these is the reference to Clement in <i>The Shepherd</i> 
  of Hermas, and the apparently clear testimony of the Canon of Muratori that 
  <i>The Shepherd</i> was written about A.D. 140.
</p><p align="center">84
</p><p>weakness. Through him we fix our gaze on the heights of heaven, through him 
  we see the reflection of his faultless and lofty countenance, through him the 
  eyes of our hearts were opened, through him our foolish and darkened understanding 
  blossoms toward the light, through him the Master (<i>i.e.</i> God) willed that 
  we should taste the immortal knowledge, 'who being the brightness of his majesty 
  is by so much greater than angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name.' 
  For it is written that 'Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame 
  of fire.' But of his son the Master said thus, 'Thou art my Son, today have 
  I begotten thee; ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.' 
  The resemblance to Hebrews is obvious, but throws less light than might be expected 
  on Clement's Christology. What did he think was the meaning of "To-day have 
  I begotten thee"? The one point which comes out clearly is that the Church was 
  regarded as an institution for the securing of the salvation offered by the 
  death of Christ. It has a divine authority, for just as Christ came from God, 
  so the Apostles came from Christ. It may almost be said that the Epistle has 
  a high Ecclesiology but an undeveloped Christology.
</p><p>Thus the Christianity revealed by 1 Clement suggests a Church which had accepted 
  Jewish ethics and a Jewish hope for resurrection, and regarded Jesus as the 
  divine messenger of God, who in turn had appointed the Apostles as the foundation 
  of the Church. It is a very simple form of cult, and in the prayer which Clement 
  quotes almost everything is directed towards the Father. It is Hellenised Judaism 
  without the ceremonial law, but with a belief in Jesus and the Church.
</p><p>The next document concerned with the Church of Rome is in many ways the most 
  important. <i>The Shepherd</i> of Hermas is not an easy book to appreciate at 
  first. It is a series of interviews between Hermas and various supernatural 
  beings who give him good advice. It may
</p><p align="center">85
</p><p>be as late as 140, but many think that it is earlier. The book was written 
  with the practical purpose of guiding rightly the Christians in Rome. There 
  is nothing in Hermas which really contradicts anything in 1 Clement, but it 
  supplements it in several directions. In the first place, like Clement, it attaches 
  great importance to the Church. No salvation is possible except in the Church, 
  and those who are and remain in it secure eternal life, or, in the phrase of 
  Hermas himself, "live to God." The only point on which Hermas is really different 
  is that he seems to have nothing to say about a resurrection, and apparently 
  was content with immortality. But this may be merely an accident and cannot 
  be pressed. 
</p><p>The book throws great light on the development of thought and practice in Rome, 
  and its Christology is the most instructive example which we possess of early 
  Adoptionism. 
</p><p>The evidence is so important, and Hermas is in general so little studied, that 
  the main passage (Sim. v. 2. 1 ff.) may be quoted: "Listen to the Parable which 
  I am going to tell you concerning Fasting. A certain man had a field, and many 
  servants, and on part of the field he planted a vineyard. And he chose out a 
  certain servant, who was faithful, in good esteem and honour with him, and he 
  called him and said to him: Take this vineyard which I have planted, and fence 
  it until I come, and do nothing more to the vineyard. And follow this order 
  of mine and you shall have your freedom from me. And the master of the servant 
  went abroad. Now when he had gone the servant took and fenced the vineyard, 
  and when he had finished the fencing of the vineyard he saw that the vineyard 
  was full of weeds. Therefore he reasoned in himself, saying: I have finished 
  this order of the Lord; I will next dig this vineyard, and it will be better 
  when it is dug, and having no weeds will yield more fruit, not being choked 
  by the weeds. He took and dug the vineyard, and pulled out all the weeds which 
  were in the
</p><p align="center">86
</p><p>vineyard. And that vineyard became very beautiful and fertile with no weeds 
  to choke it. After a time the master of the servant and the field came, and 
  entered into the vineyard, and seeing the vineyard beautifully fenced, and moreover, 
  dug, and all the weeds pulled up and vines fertile, he was greatly pleased at 
  the acts of the servant. So he called his beloved son, whom he had as heir, 
  and his friends whom he had as counsellors, and told them what he had ordered 
  his servant, and what he had found accomplished. And they congratulated the 
  servant on the character which the master gave him. And he said to them: 'I 
  promised this servant his freedom if he kept the orders which I gave him. Now 
  he has kept my orders, and has added good work in the vineyard, and greatly 
  pleased me. So in reward for this work which he has done I wish to make him 
  joint-heir with my son, because, when he had a good thought he did not put it 
  on one side, but carried it out. The son of the master agreed with this plan, 
  that the servant should be joint-heir with the son. After a few days he made 
  a feast and sent to him much food from the feast. But the servant took the food 
  which was sent to him by the master, kept what was sufficient for himself, and 
  distributed the rest to his fellow-servants. And his fellow-servants were glad 
  when they received the food, and began to pray for him, that he might find greater 
  favour with his master, because he had treated them thus. His master heard of 
  all these doings, and again rejoiced greatly at his conduct. The master again 
  assembled his friends and his son, and reported to them what he had done with 
  the food which he had received, and they were still more pleased that the servant 
  should be made joint-heir with his son." 
</p><p>A little later on the angel explains this passage. There is first a confused 
  discussion as to the work of the Son, and it is not easy to be sure whether 
  the reference is to the Holy Spirit or to Jesus, but finally the following clear 
  statement is given: "The Holy Spirit which is pre-existent,
</p><p align="center">87
</p><p>which created all creation, did God make to dwell in the flesh which he willed. 
  Therefore this flesh, in which the Holy Spirit dwelled, served the Spirit well, 
  walking in holiness and purity, and did not in any way defile the spirit. When, 
  therefore, it had lived nobly and purely, and had laboured with the Spirit, 
  and worked with it in every deed, behaving with power and bravery, he chose 
  it as companion with the Holy Spirit; for the conduct of this flesh pleased 
  him, because it was not defiled while it was bearing the Holy Spirit on earth. 
  Therefore he took the Son<sup>1</sup> and the glorious angels as counsellors, 
  that this flesh also, having served the Spirit blamelessly, should have some 
  place of sojourn, and not seem to have lost the reward of its service. For all 
  flesh in which the Holy Spirit has dwelt shall receive the reward if it be found 
  undefiled and spotless. You have the explanation of this parable also." 
</p><p>These passages clearly represent God as having a Son who is the pre-existent 
  Spirit. This Spirit is sent into human beings but leaves them if they are guilty 
  of any misconduct. In the case of one man, however, who is not named but is 
  obviously intended to be Jesus, the Spirit found complete obedience. The result 
  was that the Father proposed to the Son, that is the Spirit, and to the counsellors, 
  that is the angels, that this human being or flesh as Hermas calls it, should 
  be exalted and glorified and put on an equality with the Son. This was done, 
  and the implication of the book is that the same opportunity is offered to all 
  others who are willing to follow their Lord. It is interesting to notice that, 
  though it would be an abuse of language, it might be said that Hermas has a 
  doctrine of the Trinity, but that his Trinity does not 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Cf. Sim. ix. 1: "For that Spirit is the Son of God," and the Latin 
  (Vulgate) text of Sim. v. 5. 1, which adds to the explanation of the Parable 
  the exact statement, "Now the Son is the Holy Spirit." It is uncertain whether 
  this is the true text or merely correct explanation, but in general the Latin 
  text is better than that of the Athos MS.,—the only Greek evidence at this point.
</p><p align="center">88
</p><p>consist of Father, Son, and Spirit, but of Father, pre-existent Son, that is 
  the Spirit, and adopted Son, that is Jesus. The exact details, however, of the 
  relations subsisting between those three is a question more easily asked than 
  answered, and the next investigator of Hermas will have to consider it very 
  carefully. It is at present only possible to define the problem. As was said 
  above, Hermas seems to imply that the Spirit existed from the beginning alongside 
  of the Father, but he also implies the existence of many other good spirits 
  opposed to the army of demons who people the world. These good spirits seem 
  at times to be identified with angels, and the question will have some day to 
  be discussed afresh of the relation of these spirits to the Spirit who is the 
  Son of God and of both to the angels. Moreover, the question cannot be solved 
  without taking into account the composition of Hermas. Closely connected with 
  this problem is that of the identification of the Son of God with an angel who 
  is sometimes described as "the most glorious angel" and sometimes named as Michael. 
  Did Hermas think that the Spirit who was the Son is identical with Michael, 
  or that Jesus became Michael, or in what way are the facts to be explained? 
  Finally, did Hermas think that Christians became angels at their death?<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>On what book did Hermas base his interpretation of Jesus? There is no proof 
  that he made use of any of our existing gospels, just as it is very doubtful 
  whether 1 Clement was acquainted with any of them. 
</p><p>There is, indeed, in 1 Clement one passage referring to the words of Jesus,<sup>2</sup> 
  but it cannot be said that this is a 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> See Appendix on pp. 104 ff. 
</p><p><sup>2</sup> "Especially remembering the words of the Lord Jesus which he spoke 
  when he was teaching gentleness and long-suffering. For he spoke thus: 'Be merciful, 
  that ye may obtain mercy. Forgive, that ye may be forgiven. As ye do, so shall 
  it be done unto you. As ye give, so shall it he given unto you. As ye judge, 
  so shall ye be judged. As ye are kind, so shall kindness be shewn you. With 
  what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you.'"
</p><p align="center">89
</p><p>quotation either from Matthew or Luke. It has points of similarity to both, 
  but agrees completely with neither. No theory to explain the facts is convincing, 
  for three are possible. It may be a confused reminiscence of the existing Gospels, 
  or it may be the proof that a harmony was already in existence, or it may be 
  drawn from a document which was used by both Matthew and Luke—in other words, 
  the Q of the critics. Different minds will see different grades of probability 
  in these three hypotheses. But there is no evidence to settle the question. 
</p><p>There is no satisfactory proof that the canonical gospels were known in the 
  Church of Rome until the time of Justin Martyr. If, however, the question be 
  discussed not on the basis of what gospel is quoted by Hermas or Clement, for 
  none of them are by either, but merely on the ground of their doctrinal affinities, 
  the gospel of Mark has the best claim to consideration. According to the other 
  gospels Jesus was the Son of God from his birth, but, though Mark could be otherwise 
  interpreted, the most obvious meaning of the gospel as it stands is that Jesus 
  became Son of God at the baptism when the Spirit descended upon him. It can 
  hardly be merely a coincidence that this gospel is actually attributed by tradition<sup>1</sup> 
  to a Church which was at first adoptionist. 
</p><p>Sacramental adoptionist Christianity seems to be the nearest approach to a 
  complete transformation to a mystery religion with no philosophy, which is found 
  in the history of Christianity, but even here the basis is Jewish. 
</p><p>This is plain in its treatment of conduct. It had apparently accepted the sacramental 
  remission of sins in baptism, and there is no trace in this of any allusion 
  to original sin; the sins which are remitted had been committed by the Christian 
  before his baptism, and there is no suggestion of any inheritance of sin. Hermas 
  never 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> There is no entirely convincing evidence in favour of this tradition. 
  See, however, B. W. Bacon, "The Roman Origin of the Gospel of Mark," in <i>Harvard 
  Theological Studies</i>, vii.
</p><p align="center">90
</p><p>contemplated infant baptism. The baptized Christian started with a clean slate, 
  but what would happen to him if he lapsed again into sin? The Epistle to the 
  Hebrews clearly thought that he had no hope of further forgiveness, and Hermas 
  refers very plainly, if not to the Epistle to the Hebrews itself, at least to 
  teaching which it represents. This teaching was, of course, calculated either 
  to maintain a high standard of conduct or else to change the definition of sin. 
  Apparently none of the other mystery religions ever attached this importance 
  to conduct after initiation, but human nature presented some difficulties in 
  the enforcement of the Christian theory. It was found that the baptized frequently, 
  if not always, lapsed into sin, and that the situation complained of by 4 Ezra 
  was repeating itself.<sup>1</sup> What was the use of a system which offered 
  men immortality, but only on conditions which no one could fullfill? Hermas 
  solved the problem by having recourse to another element in Jewish thought. 
  He appealed to the possibility of repentance, and put his solution of the problem 
  into the form of a revelation made to him by an 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> "I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying, that 
  it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else when it was 
  given him, to have restrained him from sinning. For what profit is it for men 
  now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment? 
  O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art 
  not fallen alone, but we—all that come of thee. For what profit is it unto us, 
  if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that 
  bring death? And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves 
  being most wicked are made vain? And that there are laid up for us dwellings 
  of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly? And that the glory of 
  the Most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas we 
  have walked in the most wicked ways of all? And that there should be shewed 
  a paradise whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, 
  since we shall not enter into it? For we have walked in unpleasant places. And 
  that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, 
  whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness? For while we lived and committed 
  iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer for it after death" 
  (4 Ezra vii. 46-56).
</p><p align="center">91
</p><p>angel—the Shepherd of the book. The revelation which Hermas announces is that 
  there is one repentance, but only one, for those who sin after baptism. If repentance 
  is taken merely as an act of contrition this obviously does little to solve 
  the problem: it is not really sufficient to cover the facts of human nature. 
  But for Hermas repentance is much more than contrition. It consists apparently 
  of cheerful submission to all the unpleasant happenings of life, which are regarded 
  as organised by an angel, specially appointed for the purpose, in order to adapt 
  them to the improvement of sinners. From the general characteristic of the parables 
  it is clear that Hermas did not contemplate the immediate restoration of the 
  penitent, or the immediate elimination of sin. Penitence is for him an unpleasant 
  process of education, and I think he contemplates the probability that it is 
  lifelong. Like all education it demands that the pupil shall obey his teacher, 
  and the teacher is in this case the angel of repentance, who arranges life so 
  as to make it educative. It is the beginning of the great Catholic system of 
  penance which it is so difficult to estimate at its full value because of its 
  corruption and exploitation in the Middle Ages. Whether one believes in the 
  existence of an angel of repentance or not, the view that life with all its 
  happenings is an education, which gradually teaches men, if they are willing 
  to accept it, how to cease to be sinful, was a great lesson for the second century, 
  and I do not doubt that it had much to do with producing in the next century 
  a Church which, in spite of persecution, ultimately won the assent of the best 
  part of the Roman world. Though the form in which Hermas presented his teaching 
  was mythological and crude it contained truths which cannot be neglected.
</p><p>No one can read <i>The Shepherd</i> of Hermas without feeling that it has not 
  been adequately discussed by modern scholarship. It is the key to the proper 
  understanding of Roman Christianity at the beginning of the second cen-
</p><p align="center">92
</p><p>tury, but to use this key properly it must be subjected to a process of criticism 
  to determine the relations of its constituent parts to one another, and to the 
  contemporary or almost contemporary documents—1 Clement and the Epistle to the 
  Hebrews. 
</p><p>Adoptionist Christianity was not destined to conquer the world, and though 
  Roman Christianity proved to be the surviving form it had first to change much 
  of its character in a manner which can with some degree of picturesque exaggeration 
  be described as conquest by Ephesus. 
</p><p>The early development of Christianity in Ephesus is more obscure than it is 
  in Rome; it ceased quite soon to flourish in its place of origin, but lived 
  on elsewhere. The documents which represent the first stages of its growth are 
  the later Pauline epistles, and the Fourth Gospel. They are inextricably involved 
  in critical questions which have as yet received less attention than the synoptic 
  problem. 
</p><p>This is especially true of the later epistles. In them, as distinct from the 
  earlier epistles, we have a cosmical Christology which regards Christ as a pre-existent 
  divine person who became a human being. Of that there is no doubt, nor can it 
  be disputed that there are one or two passages in the earlier epistles which 
  seem to pave the way for this kind of thought; but these passages are very few, 
  and as it were wholly incidental. Thus the critical question arises whether 
  these later epistles were written by the same person as the author of the earlier 
  ones. The point has never been discussed fully in England, and by but a very 
  few scholars on the Continent. The result is that it is only possible at present 
  to say that three solutions are possible and are awaiting discussion. The first 
  is that Paul's thought moved very rapidly in the last years of his life, and 
  that the difference between the earlier and the later epistles only represents 
  the development of his
</p><p align="center">93
</p><p>thought. This is certainly a possible solution. There is no literary objection 
  to it which cannot adequately be answered. The only doubt is the psychological 
  question whether the development implied is not so great as to be improbable. 
  A second possibility is that the later epistles are not Pauline but are the 
  work of some of Paul's followers. This is also possible, and from the nature 
  of the case scarcely admits of proof or of refutation. The third possibility 
  was suggested in 1877 by H. J. Holtzmann, who thought that Ephesians represents 
  the work of the second generation, and that Colossians was a genuine epistle 
  interpolated by the author of Ephesians. It is said sometimes that this is an 
  incredibly complicated hypothesis. Undoubtedly it is complicated, but so are 
  the facts, and those who regard it as incredible forget that it is merely the 
  application to the Pauline epistles of exactly the same process as every one 
  knows to have been suffered by the epistles of Ignatius. Therefore this theory 
  also is perfectly possible, and ultimately, unless the interest in critical 
  questions dies out altogether, the discussion of these three possibilities is 
  certain to receive fresh attention.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>The critical questions concerned with the Fourth Gospel are better known. But 
  whether it is later than the later epistles of Paul, and whether it represents 
  the result of their influence or is a parallel line of thought is another problem 
  which has not yet been fully discussed: in any case, it is cognate with them. 
  No one knows who wrote the Fourth Gospel. Tradition ascribes it to John the 
  son of Zebedee, but all critical probability is against this 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> I have at present no clear opinion on the problem, except that 
  I am strongly disinclined to accept the rather popular view which receives Colossians 
  as Pauline and rejects Ephesians. Unless some theory similar to Holtzmann's 
  be accepted, I think that Colossians and Ephesians stand or fall together. The 
  popular distinction is partly due to the fact that Protestant scholarship is 
  more sensitive to the un-Pauline ecclesiology of Ephesians, which it repudiates, 
  than to the un-Pauline Christology of Colossians, to which it adheres.
</p><p align="center">94
</p><p>theory. It seems tolerably clear that the Fourth Gospel was not written by 
  an eye-witness, and that it implies not a knowledge of the historic Jesus so 
  much as an acquaintance with the subapostolic Church. It is apparently an attempt 
  to rewrite the story of Jesus in the interests of a "pre-existent" Christology, 
  and of a high form of sacramental teaching. 
</p><p>Tradition connects both the later Pauline epistles and the Fourth Gospel with 
  the Province of Asia, and especially with Ephesus. There is no reason for doubting 
  this tradition, but it is strange how soon its creative spirit passed to Alexandria, 
  a Church of which the origin is as obscure as the later history is famous. 
</p><p>Tantalising though many of these problems are, there is no doubt as to the 
  main characteristics of the Christianity of Ephesus and its neighbourhood. Its 
  Christology was the reverse of Adoptionist. It did not think of Jesus as a man 
  who had become divine, but as a God who had become human. Moreover, an identification 
  of this pre-existent being with the Logos of the philosopher was gradually approached 
  in the later Epistles, and finally made in the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel. 
</p><p>The word Logos has an intricate and long history which has often been treated 
  in books on the New Testament: it is quite unnecessary to repeat it at length. 
  But it has not usually been sufficiently noted that the difficulty of the problems 
  raised by it are mainly due to its use in different ways in different systems 
  of thought. The popular Stoic philosophy, with its belief in a God immanent 
  in the universe, could use Logos in the sense of the governing principle of 
  the world, and as little less than a synonym, or, perhaps one should say, description 
  of God. On the other hand, a transcendental theology such as Platonism, believing 
  in a God entirely above all existence in the universe, needed a connecting link 
  between God and the world, and could use Logos in this sense. Finally, a mediatising 
  writer such as Cornutus could explain that
</p><p align="center">95
</p><p>the Logos was Hermes, and so triumphantly reconcile philosophy and myth, by 
  giving a mythological meaning to a philosophic term. 
</p><p>All this is clear enough; but the difficulty begins when one asks in which 
  sense the writer of the Fourth Gospel used the phrase. Did he mean that the 
  Logos was the <i>anima mundi</i>? The phrase "the true light which lighteth 
  every one" is susceptible of such a meaning. But it seems more probable that 
  his theology was in the main transcendental, and that the Logos was for him 
  the connecting link between God and the world. But how far is the Prologue really 
  metaphysical and not comparable in its identification of Jesus and the Logos 
  to Cornutus,<sup>1</sup> with his identification of Hermes and the Logos?
</p><p>Further problems arise if an effort is made to reconstruct fully the Ephesian 
  Christianity of which the Fourth Gospel is the product. After the Prologue the 
  Logos does not seem to be mentioned again; Jesus appears as the supernatural 
  Lord (though this word is not characteristic of the Gospel) who reveals the 
  Father to men. He offers them salvation by regeneration in baptism, and by eating 
  his flesh and blood in the Eucharist. They become super-naturally the children 
  of God. This is the teaching of the Hellenised Church, not of the historic Jesus. 
  But running through the Gospel there is also another line of thought which regards 
  salvation as due to knowledge rather than sacraments. What is the relation to 
  each other of these two ways of regarding salvation? The problem has scarcely 
  been formulated by the students of the Fourth Gospel, much less adequately discussed. 
</p><p>Obviously the tendency of Ephesian Christianity was to minimise the human characteristics 
  of the historic Jesus, and to merge into Docetism. This can be seen in the Fourth 
  Gospel, and in the allied Johannine Epistles. The writer is fully aware of the 
  danger, and protests 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> <font face="Symbol">Tugcanei de ErmhV o logoV, on apesteilan proV 
  hmaV ex ouranou oi qeoi. </font>Cornutus, <i>De Natura Deorum</i>, xvi.
</p><p align="center">96
</p><p>against Docetism, but his own writings with very small changes would have been 
  admirably adapted for Docetic purposes.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>If Ephesian Christianity had never come to Rome, and met its complement in 
  the Adoptionists, it might, in spite of the Fourth Gospel, have degenerated 
  into thorough-going Docetism, or have been represented only by Gnostics. It 
  is hard either to prove or to refute the suggestion that Alexandrian Gnosticism 
  of the Valentinian type came from Ephesus along the Syrian coast, and that the 
  ultimately successful Catholicism of Pantaenus and Clement came from the other 
  stream which passed first northwards and then through Italy to Alexandria. Each 
  of these streams accumulated new ideas on the way: the stream passing through 
  Syria found the Eastern Gnostics of whom Simon Magus is alleged to have been 
  the first. The other stream passed through Rome and found Adoptionism. The combination 
  with this strengthened the belief in the true humanity of Jesus, and in his 
  real divinity, thus providing the groundwork for the Christological development 
  of Irenaeus and his successors in the fourth century.<sup>2</sup> 
</p><p>The man who seems to have brought Ephesian Christianity to Rome was Justin 
  Martyr, sometimes called the Philosopher. This title is somewhat unfair to philosophers, 
  for the only claim which Justin could make to the name was that he had dabbled 
  with little profit in many schools before he was converted to Christianity by 
  an old man who gave him the Christian interpretation of the Old Testament. 
</p><p>Justin is in fact not much more philosophic than 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> The Leucian Acts of John and Andrew, which seem to have a real 
  connection with the Johannine tradition, represent this Docetic tendency. 
</p><p><sup>2</sup> I must emphasise the speculative nature of this suggestion. So 
  far as I know, there is not any evidence that Pantaenus was in Rome, or that 
  Clement was influenced by Roman thought. But—merely as a guess—the idea appeals 
  to me as probable in itself.
</p><p align="center">97
</p><p>Hermas. His Christology is the incarnation of the Logos; but Logos is for him 
  merely the name of a second God who is responsible for creation and redemption. 
  Of the many books which he is said to have written only his two Apologies and 
  his Dialogue with Trypho are extant. The latter is a long rambling exposition 
  of the proof from the Old Testament, in the Septuagint version, that there is 
  a "second God," and that his incarnation in Jesus was foretold. The Apologies 
  also are full of proof from the Old Testament, but contain most valuable statements 
  as to the Christian cult and its sacraments. They are also remarkable for insisting 
  that the heathen religions are due to the clumsy efforts of demons to deceive 
  men by false fulfillments of scripture.
</p><p>Justin was not a man of commanding intellect, but he seems to have brought 
  Ephesian Christianity to Rome, and so began in that city the synthesis with 
  Greek philosophy which the later Pauline epistles and Fourth Gospel began in 
  Ephesus and Origen completed in Alexandria. He appears to have been martyred 
  in Rome, perhaps owing to the hostility of Crescens, a cynic philosopher with 
  whom he had quarrelled. The acts of his martyrdom are extant; the most significant 
  point in them is his dissociation from other bodies of Christians in Rome.<sup>1</sup> 
  This is seen from the following extract from his examination by Rusticus the 
  Prefect: 
</p><p>"Rusticus the prefect said, 'Where do you assemble?' Justin said, 'Where inclination 
  and ability lead each of us. For do you really think that we all assemble in 
  the same place? That is not the case, because the God of the Christians is not 
  locally circumscribed, but, though he cannot be seen, fills heaven and earth 
  and receives worship and glorification from the faithful in all places.' Rusticus 
  the prefect said, 'Tell me where you assemble 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> The address in Rome which Justin gives is obscure, but it is supposed 
  to be the same as the bath called Novatian's on the Via Viminalis. See Otto's 
  note on the subject.
</p><p align="center">98
</p><p>or in what place you collect your disciples.' Justin said, 'I am staying above 
  the baths of a certain Martin, the son of Timothinus, and throughout this period 
  (it is my second visit to Rome) I am unacquainted with any other assembly except 
  that in this house. And if any one wished to come with me, I communicated to 
  him the words of truth.'"<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>It would be possible to fill a volume with the discussion of the development 
  of the Logos doctrine after the time of Justin Martyr. All that can here be 
  done is to note how it passed from Rome to Alexandria—from Justin to Origen—and 
  to compare certain aspects of it with Adoptionist Christianity, and to consider 
  the position which either of these Christologies can take in modern theology. 
</p><p>It is very doubtful whether Justin Martyr or the writer of the Fourth Gospel 
  had any concept of Immaterial Reality. To Justin Martyr, at least, the Logos 
  appears to have been a second God, and his identification of Jesus with the 
  Logos is much more like that of Cornutus—mutatis mutandis—than anything else 
  which we possess. But however this may be, the Logos Christology was invaluable 
  for Origen in finding room in Christian theology for the identification of God 
  with Immaterial Reality. We may paraphrase rather than explain his teaching 
  by saying that he believed in the divinity and unity of Immaterial Reality, 
  but thought also that diversity as well as unity could be predicated of it; 
  that man belonged on one side of his nature to Immaterial Reality, and

  thinkers, Origen failed to make clear exactly what is the relation between the 
  Immaterial Reality which is eternal and changeless and the Material Reality 
  which is subject to change and time, and is the basis of phenomena. But in some 
  way, he believed, the Logos<sup>1</sup> was that power of Immaterial Reality 
  which stretches out and mingles with the world of matter. It is impossible and 
  undesirable to expound at length this general theory; it must suffice to notice 
  its bearings on Christology.
</p><p>In the first place, it seems to have overcome the tendency of Logos theology 
  to produce Docetism. The earlier forms of this kind of teaching which represented 
  the Logos as a spirit who came down to rescue humanity offered no real reason 
  for maintaining the true humanity of Jesus. It seems to have been the pressure 
  of recognised fact, which had not yet been forgotten, which made the writer 
  of the Fourth Gospel and of the First Epistle of John protest so strongly against 
  Docetism. The tendency of their teaching by itself was all the other way, and 
  the Acts of John, with their completely unreal humanity of Jesus, are the natural, 
  though no doubt unlooked-for, results of the Ephesian school. But that is not 
  the case with Origen, and cannot be the case with any Christology or theology 
  which really understands the doctrine of Immaterial Reality. It is possible 
  to have a spirit, using the word in the popular and material sense, which looks 
  like a human being, but is not really one, but that cannot be so with Immaterial 
  Reality. 
</p><p>Origen achieved a synthesis with Greek philosophy which enabled Christianity 
  to accept a belief in Immaterial Reality without a Docetic Christology, but 
  it must be remembered that Origen was able to do this largely because he stood 
  in the line of succession from the Fourth 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> The elements of multiplicity, he thinks, are contained in the 
  Logos, which is therefore secondary to the Father.
</p><p align="center">100
</p><p>Gospel and Justin Martyr. He did not take the word Logos in the same sense 
  as Justin had done, and he permanently changed, and indeed partly confused, 
  Christian terminology by giving the meaning of immaterial to the words spirit 
  and spiritual. They have in the main retained this meaning ever since, but students 
  of the New Testament will do well to remember that this is not the meaning of 
  the words in the original, and that Origen, though neither the first nor the 
  last is probably the ablest of the long line of theologians who have introduced 
  metaphysics into Christian doctrine by a perverse exegesis of the words of Scripture. 
</p><p>The Catholic Christianity which emerged from the struggle between Adoptionism 
  and the Logos Christology was a curious combination of both. In the strict sense 
  of Christology, Adoptionism was completely abandoned. Jesus was regarded as 
  the eternal Logos who became man, not as the inspired and perfect man who became 
  God. But in the sphere of soteriology the legacy of Adoptionism can clearly 
  be seen. The Christian became the adopted son of God, joint heir with Christ, 
  and this remained part of Catholic teaching. It is not, however, really consistent 
  with the Logos doctrine, and is logically part of Adoptionism. The incoherence 
  introduced at this point was met by the splendid paradox of Irenaeus and Athanasius 
  that God became man in order that man might become God. But splendid though 
  this be, it remains a paradox, and it was diluted very considerably in later 
  theology, which seems to have felt that the abandonment of Adoptionism in the 
  sphere of Christology necessitated its abandonment in the doctrine of salvation. 
  Thus, at least in popular theology, the grandiose conception of the apotheosis 
  of humanity has passed into the far more mythological one of becoming an angel 
  after death—a view very widely held, though perhaps never officially recognised.
</p><p align="center">101
</p><p>What part can either Adoptionism or the Logos Christology play in any modern 
  form of thought? Adoptionism seems to me to have no part or lot in any intelligent 
  modern theology, though it is unfortunately often promulgated, especially in 
  pulpits which are regarded as liberal. We cannot believe that at any time a 
  human being, in consequence of his virtue, became God, which he was not before, 
  or that any human being ever will do so. No doctrine of Christology and no doctrine 
  of salvation which is Adoptionist in essence can come to terms with modern thought. 
</p><p>The doctrine of the Logos is on a different plane. In the form in which it 
  is presented by Justin Martyr it is probably as unacceptable as Adoptionism, 
  but in the form presented by Origen the modern mind constantly feels that the 
  writer is struggling to express its own thoughts, and is attracted to Origen 
  not only by the recognition of a common purpose, but by a consciousness of a 
  common failure, for, at the end, reality transcends thought and language, and 
  the philosophy of Alexandria was no more completely successful than is that 
  of our world. 
</p><p>I have often felt in talking with younger men of the present day how closely 
  they have approached to the position of Origen and how far they are from him 
  in method. If I may put into my own words the form of thought which seems to 
  animate them, it is something of this kind. They feel that the world in which 
  we live is the expression of some great plan or purpose or pattern which is 
  not yet complete, which shows no sign of finality, but is ever growing in complexity; 
  which resolves itself again and again into simplicity, and then spreads out 
  again on a yet wider scale. The plan or purpose is not a dead mechanical thing; 
  the life which explains it is within and not without it. Men are partly the 
  result, but partly also the instruments or even agents of this purpose. Wisdom 
  is the right understanding of its nature; and right-
</p><p align="center">102
</p><p>eousness is the attempt to subordinate human purposes to this great purpose 
  of life. For man is not only an effect, he is a cause. When he acts, he brings 
  into existence a new cause of which the results will follow in accordance with 
  the established laws of reality. But there is a moment of choice, when he has 
  it within his power to decide whether he will act or not. If he choose right, 
  his actions will be taken up into the great web of existence, consistently with 
  the great purpose. If he choose wrongly, the results will in the end be destroyed, 
  not without suffering to himself and others. 
</p><p>To a more vivid imagination which thinks in pictures rather than in metaphysical 
  language, life presents itself as a great web which is slowly coming from the 
  loom, and sometimes there seems to be behind the loom the figure of the great 
  weaver; at other times the weaving is being carried on by men and women whose 
  weaving sometimes conforms, sometimes does not, to an infinitely complicated 
  but symmetrical plan which, and here is the paradoxical tragedy, they can only 
  see in the web which has been already woven; but they know that whether what 
  they weave will remain or not depends upon its being in accord with the pattern. 
  And then the picture changes slightly, and it seems as though the pattern begins 
  to reveal the same features as those dimly discerned in the weaver behind the 
  loom. And yet again the picture changes, and it is not merely the great weaver, 
  but the men and women who are working that reappear with him to live on in the 
  pattern emerging in the web. 
</p><p>That is not the same thing as the Logos Christology or doctrine of salvation 
  as propounded by Origen, but I think that he would have understood it had he 
  lived now. It is not the same thing as the teaching of the Kingdom of God preached 
  by Jesus, yet I do not think that he would have condemned it, for great men 
  understand the thoughts of lesser ones though they themselves fail to be understood. 
  The thoughts and words of Jesus, like those
</p><p align="center">103
</p><p>of Origen, were borrowed from his own time and race; they belong to the first 
  century as those of Origen belong to the third. No historical reconstruction 
  can make them adequate for our generation, or even intelligible except to those 
  who have passed through an education in history impossible for most. But the 
  will of Jesus and the will of Origen, if we can reach them through the language 
  and thought of their time, have no such limitations. If I have understood them 
  rightly, both were animated by a desire to accomplish the purpose of God, the 
  God who is life.<sup>1</sup> And that purpose did not appeal to them as the 
  achievement for themselves of any salvation, in this world or in the world to 
  come, beyond the reach of other men, but rather to show them what is the way 
  of life, the natural way, consistent with the purpose of God and the pattern 
  of life. So far as they succeeded in their teaching they did so because they 
  devoted themselves to expressing clearly what they wished without troubling 
  to ask whether it conformed to what other people said, and they spoke the clearest 
  language which they could find in their own generation. 
</p><p>To do the same thing is the business of preachers and teachers today. The man 
  who tries merely to repeat the thoughts or the words of past generations forgets 
  that the call which comes to the teacher is not to repeat what others have said 
  because they have said it, but to say what is true because it is true, and to 
  say it in the language of his own time that it may be intelligible. He will 
  often appear to contradict the thought or the language of Jesus or of Paul or 
  of Origen, but he will be loyal to the purpose which was theirs, and yet so 
  much more than theirs. 
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Perhaps the most significant difference between Jesus and Origen 
  is that Origen was inclined to find the concrete expression of the Purpose of 
  Life in self-realisation—he was in the best sense a Gnostic—while Jesus found 
  it in the service of the weak, ignorant, and sinful, rather than merely in loyal 
  obedience to the strong, wise, and righteous. The two are complementary, not 
  contradictory—but they are not identical.
