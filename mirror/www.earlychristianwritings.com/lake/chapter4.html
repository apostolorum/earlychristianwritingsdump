<p>CHAPTER IV
</p><p>CORINTH</p></center>

<p>Christianity had been profoundly changed by its passage from Galilee
to Jerusalem. Whereas the teaching of Jesus had been the announcement of
the kingdom of God, the illustration of its character, and the insistent
call to men to repent, the central teaching of the disciples in Jerusalem
became the claim that Jesus was the Messiah. But the passage from Jerusalem
to Antioch had produced still greater changes. After all, the teaching
of the disciples in Jerusalem contained no elements foreign to Judaism.
It was probably considered by the Jewish authorities as the erroneous application
to Jesus of opinions which, rightly or wrongly, were widely held among
the Jews; but nothing in it represented concession to Hellenism. As soon
as Hellenism was suspected the Christians were at once driven out. In Antioch,
on the other hand, much that was distinctly Jewish was abandoned, and Hellenistic
thought adopted, so that Jesus became the divine centre of a cult. It is
incredible that he should have been so regarded by the Jews of Jerusalem;
it is impossible that he should not have been by Gentiles.
</p><p>It is remarkable that Paul and the other Antiochean missionaries were
willing to accept this development, and to make themselves the enthusiastic
agents of its propaganda; but they clearly did so, and the point is of
extreme importance for the history of Judaism.<sup>1</sup> The only alternative
to large concessions to the position of the Dutch
</p><p><sup>1</sup> See C. Monteflore, <i>Judaism and St. Paul</i>.
</p><center>
<p>57</p></center>

<p>radicals is to admit that in the Diaspora the Hellenising of Jews had
proceeded more rapidly and far deeper than has as a rule been supposed.
</p><p>The result is clear, however obscure the process may be; Christianity
became a Graeco-Oriental cult, offering salvation, just as did the other
mystery religions. It competed with them for the right of succession to
the official religion of Rome, and ultimately it triumphed. To understand
the situation it is necessary to comprehend the general nature of these
cults, and to see the points of likeness and difference in Christianity.
</p><p>In general all the mystery religions assumed the existence of a Lord,
who had passed through various experiences on earth, and finally been glorified
and exalted. He had left behind the secret of obtaining the same reward,
in the form partly of knowledge, partly of magical ceremonies. His followers
knew this secret, and admitted into it those whom the Lord was willing
to accept. The initiated obtained protection in this world, and a blessed
immortality after death. The Lord was probably not usually identified with
the Supreme God; for instance, in Mithraism the Sun, not Mithras, was originally
the supreme God, though in the last stages of the cult the difference between
the two was apparently blurred, and Mithras became indistinguishable from
the Sun.
</p><p>The Christianity revealed in 1 Corinthians clearly conforms to this
type. It has its Lord, Jesus, who is far more than human, but is not identified
with the supreme God "the Father";<sup>1</sup> he has suffered on earth,
but been glorified and exalted, and Christians who accept him in faith,
and are initiated into the Church by the sacrament of Baptism, obtain a
share in his glory, and will enjoy a blessed immortality. The general resemblance
is striking and undeniable. It may be summarised, as was said above, by
the statement that Christianity offered men salvation, and was believed
to fulfill its offer. Indeed, its
</p><p><sup>1</sup> 1 Cor. viii. 6.
</p><center>
<p>58</p></center>

<p>success was partly due not to any difference from the other cults, but
to the fact that it made more exclusive claims, combined with a higher
ethical standard, than any other.
</p><p>But what exactly was meant by salvation? No single answer can be given.
In one sense salvation was primarily an eschatological concept, though
its formulation was different among Jewish-minded and Greek-minded believers.
The Jew meant, in the main, that, at the great day when the dead would
rise and join the living before the judgement seat of God, he would be
safe from the Divine Wrath, be acquitted, and have a place among those
who would live in happiness in the Age to Come. The Greek probably thought
rather that each soul which was saved would pass at death to a happier
and better existence. Ultimately these two strands of eschatology were
woven together, though scarcely reconciled, in the elaborate fabric of
the Catholic system of purgatory, paradise, resurrection, judgement, heaven
and hell.
</p><p>In another sense salvation meant something different, which was not
eschatological. In accordance with the general spirit of the Graeco-Oriental
mysteries, there existed a belief that through sacraments men could change
their nature, be born again, and—as Irenaeus puts it—become the children
of the eternal and unchangeable God instead of the children of mortal man.<sup>1</sup>
In this way they passed, even before death, into eternal life, and they
were raised to an existence beyond the reach of Fate. The basis of this
concept was doubtless astral, and at least some early Christians believed
that whereas the unbaptized were subject to the inimical decrees of the
stars, the regenerate were immune.
</p><p>Judged by our standards this belief is magical, just as the Jewish eschatology
is mythological. Neither has part or lot in modern thinking; this does
not necessarily prove that they are wrong, but it means that the problem
for us is not one of details, but of opposing systems, the parts of
</p><p><sup>1</sup> Irenaeus, <i>Apostolio Preaching</i>, p. 3.
</p><center>
<p>59</p></center>

<p>which cannot be interchanged. We can, with logical propriety, accept
the Graeco-Jewish eschatology or the Graeco-Oriental sacramental regeneration
if we reject modern thought. But we cannot, except in intellectual chaos
combine the two, or appropriately express modern thought in language belonging
to the ancient systems.
</p><p>The modern man does not believe in any form of salvation known to ancient
Christianity. He does believe that so long as life lasts, and he does not
know of any limit to its duration, good and evil are realities, and those
who do good, and are good, achieve life of increasingly higher and higher
potentiality. If anything were gained in practical life by calling this
"salvation," it would be right and wise to do so. But in fact it is disastrous,
for it obscures thought and confuses language.
</p><p>Thus there is no doubt as to the general resemblance of the Christian
offer of salvation to that of other cults, and the obvious point of difference—the
presence of the Jewish eschatology—has no claim to superior truth. What,
then, are the points of difference between Christianity and the other cults
which explain the triumph of the Church? Two popular but probably mistaken
explanations may first be discussed.
</p><p>It is often said that Christianity had an enormous advantage in that
Jesus was an historic person, whereas the Lords of the other cults were
not. But closer analysis does not confirm the importance of this difference.
</p><p>The initiates of the other cults believed that their Lords were historic
persons, just as Christians believed that Jesus was. They had, indeed,
lived a long time ago, but this was no disadvantage: any one who reads
Tatian's <i>Oratio ad Graecos</i> can see how antiquity, not recentness,
was regarded as desirable. The general argument of Christians was not that
Jesus was historic, and the other Lords were not, but that he fulfilled
a true offer of salvation, made in a more remote antiquity than any pagan
</p><center>
<p>60</p></center>

<p>religion could claim, while the heathen Lords were demons, misunderstanding
the prophecies of the Old Testament, clumsily simulating their fulfillment,
and arrogating to themselves the title of God. It was of course an advantage
that the "sacred legend" of Christianity was free from the repulsive elements
in other cults, which it taxed the ingenuity of a Julian to explain.
</p><p>Moreover, historical criticism shows that the points in the story of
Jesus which played the greatest part in commending Christianity to a generation
asking for private salvation are those which are not historic. The element
of truth in much perverse criticism, arguing that Jesus never existed,
is that the Jesus of history is quite different from the Lord assumed as
the founder of Catholic Christianity. The Church conquered the world by
offering salvation through a redeeming Lord. Jesus made no such offer:
to him the Kingdom of God, the pearl of great price, was the natural inheritance
of men, if they would only take it. No supernatural change of nature, but
to turn round, abandon all that hindered, and go in the right direction—go
home—was the repentance which he required. Probably it was not unique teaching:
it is very hard to obey, and it makes no spectacular demands. Its only
claim to acceptance is its truth. It did not conquer the world. Nor did
Jesus—the Jesus of history—think that it would do so. "Strait is the gate
and narrow is the way that leadeth unto Life, and few there are that find
it."
</p><p>Thus the theory that Catholic Christianity succeeded because Jesus was
an historic person cannot be sustained.
</p><p>Nor is there much more truth in the attribution of its success to the
influence of the personality of Jesus. No doubt it was the personality
of Jesus which influenced his immediate followers, made them regard him
as the Davidic Messiah or as "Son of Man," and rendered possible their
belief in his exaltation to the right hand of God. Without this belief
Christianity could never have come into existence; but once the belief
was established
</p><center>
<p>61</p></center>

<p>it became the foundation of the whole structure, and the personality
of Jesus was quite eclipsed by the supernatural value attached to him.
Not the men who had known Jesus, but those who had not, converted the Roman
Empire, and their gospel was that of the Cross, Resurrection, and Parousia,
not the Sermon on the Mount, or an ethical interpretation of the Parables,
or a moral <i>imitatio Christi</i>.
</p><p>The true answer is that Catholic Christianity conquered because it was
popular, not because it was true, and failed for the same reason. Permanence,
not popularity, is the test of truth; for truth has often no adherents,
while error has many.
</p><p>The permanent truth in Christianity is, I think, to be found in the
spirit, or perhaps more correctly the "will," which Jesus had, and tried
to hand on to his disciples, of service and self-sacrifice. It calls men
to redeem others, rather than to seek redemption for themselves. This is
to spiritual life what gravitation is to the physical world. It was known
to others before him and after, but it has not yet conquered the world.
</p><p>But the popular teaching<sup>1</sup> which loomed largest in the early
days of the Church offered the privilege rather than the responsibility
of redemption, and maintained that the Christian was united to the Supreme
God—a claim higher than that made by any other cult. This side of Christianity,
though not Jewish, was in the main derived from Judaism, from which all
the first Christian missionaries accepted the preaching of the one supreme
God, whom Paul constantly refers to as "the Father." There has been of
recent years much loose writing and looser speech about the "Fatherhood
of God." It has even been asserted that this was the special revelation
of Jesus. Such a view does not for a moment sustain any critical inves-
</p><p><sup>1</sup> I would emphasise the word popular. The great missionaries
were doubtless inspired by the desire to save others, by the will to minister
rather than be ministered to, and by a readiness to give their lives as
a ransom for others, but their converts were otherwise minded.
</p><center>
<p>62</p></center>

<p>tigation. No doubt Jesus sometimes, possibly often, spoke of God as
"Father"; but so did many other Jews. They and he referred to the moral
sonship of the righteous, not to a supernatural or sacramental relation.
Nor is there any sign that Jesus felt that he had any new revelation as
to the nature of God: he was much more intent on telling men what they
ought to do to conform to the demands of God.
</p><p>But after the time of Jesus the use of "Father" as applied to God became
more and more general; especially to denote the peculiar relationship—however
that may have been conceived—between Jesus and God. This use is especially
characteristic of the editor of Matthew, and still more of the Fourth Gospel.
It is the correlative to the process by which "Jesus, the Son of God,"
became "God the Son."
</p><p>The Hellenistic Christians seem to have been particularly fond of this
use; partly perhaps from linguistic reasons. The Greek for Jehovah is <i>icbpios</i>,
Lord; but this word had been already taken as the title of Jesus. Therefore
when a Christian-speaking Greek wished to refer to Jehovah he could not
without ambiguity say "The Lord," and he began to adopt the usage of referring
to Jehovah as "the Father." But what would have been the implication to
Greek ears of this usage? Two lines were possible: it could be interpreted
as referring exclusively to the relation between God and Jesus, or as referring
to the relation between God and men. Paul is evidence that the second,
as well as the first, was accepted. "As many as are led by the Spirit of
God, they are Sons of God." But how would a Greek have understood this
verse? Probably he would have thought that it meant that the gift of the
Spirit changed men's nature; so that, as Irenaeus said, two generations
later, they were no longer mortal men but the children of the immortal
God. To the Greek the gift of the Spirit was the gift of divine nature,
immortal and incorruptible. That is, of course,
</p><center>
<p>63</p></center>

<p>in nowise Jewish: even if Paul meant this, which is doubtful, he did
so by virtue of his Greek associations. The question, however, has not
been adequately discussed how far this interpretation is exactly the same
as that of the other cults. It clearly brought the Christian into direct
relation with the Supreme God, through the Lord. Was this so in Mithraism
or in the cult of Isis? In both of them it seems rather that the initiate
was brought rather into relationship with the Lord.<sup>1</sup> Surely
it was a real advantage to Christian propaganda that the Church offered
union with the Supreme God more definitely than did any rival cult.
</p><p>Two elements must be distinguished in such teaching. Permanently important
in it is the recognition of the fact that a helping hand of grace stretches
out from the unknown to help man when he cries from the depths: but it
contains also a theory as to the origin and nature of grace. The fact is
indisputable, the theory depends on evidence; and there is really none
to justify confident assertion. No doubt it was an enormous asset to Christianity
to proclaim that the grace found by its adherents came straight from the
cause of all existence. The same situation was reproduced after the Reformation,
and it
</p><p><sup>1</sup> This statement would be required to be modified for detailed
application to various classes both among Christians and among initiates
in the other cults. In all cults there was probably an uneducated substratum
which thought very little about the subject. It was satisfied with the
fact of salvation, and was not specially interested in its method. On the
other hand, the educated with a metaphysical tendency were interested in
the relation of the Lord of the cult to the Supreme God, and this might,
in time, have produced something similar to the Christological speculations
of the fourth century. Apuleius seems to identify the Supreme God with
the Lord in a manner which at times reminds the reader of Sabellian Christianity.
On the other hand, Heliogabalus seems to have produced a complete amalgam
between Mithras and Helios, and reminds us of the tendency of uneducated
Christianity in all generations to make the gospel become the preaching
of the new God, or the true God, Jesus, of which I heard a somewhat extreme
example from a preacher who maintained fervidly that Jehovah was the Hebrew
of Jesus.
</p><center>
<p>64</p></center>

<p>was an asset to Protestantism to claim direct access to God, without
the mediation of saints. Nevertheless, it is hard to see that there is
any evidence to favour the theory that grace comes in the one way rather
than the other. The element of truth in the early Christian teaching is
not the side which was most popular, but rather that which, a little later,
partly unconsciously, animated the Church in rejecting Marcionism—the conviction
that there is no essential disharmony or final clash in history, that the
God of creation is not hostile to the God of grace.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>Moreover, it was not only—or even chiefly—the helping hand of grace
in the troubles and sorrows of life which Greek Christians especially hoped
for by union with the supreme God or by the power of Jesus. It was rather
the gift of eternal Life after death, which was the special characteristic
of the Gods. The points of importance are the means whereby they thought
that this immortality was obtained, and the nature which they ascribed
to it.
</p><p>The act by which the faithful acquired immortality was Baptism. The
history of this distinctively Christian rite is obscure. From the standpoint
of the historian of religions it is the combination of a Jewish ceremony
with Graeco-Oriental ideas. The Jews had frequently practised ceremonial
washing with a religious significance—generally speaking, purification
from the guilt of offences against the ritual law; it was also part of
the initiation of proselytes, and had been largely practised by John the
Forerunner. But in no case did any Jew think that washing could change,
sacramentally or magically, the nature of man. A Greek on the other hand,
brought up in the atmosphere of the mysteries, might well have thought
so. The same is true of the other constituent
</p><p><sup>1</sup> See the last chapter of F. C. Burkitt's The Gospel History
and its Transmission. This chapter is a most clear-sighted analysis of
one of the essentials of Catholic truth as opposed to error, and I venture
to say this because its importance seems in general to be overlooked.
</p><center>
<p>65</p></center>

<p>element in primitive Christian Baptism— the formula "in the name of
the Lord Jesus." There is no reason why Jews should not have used the name
of Jesus for magical purposes—indeed they undoubtedly did so—for magic
was not peculiar to the Greeks. But the ordinary Jew would never have practised
magic to secure immortality or to become divine. He believed that immortality
was the natural lot of all the chosen people who kept the Law, and would
be reached, not through sacraments or secret knowledge, but through the
resurrection at the last day. Thus it is possible that the first Jewish
Christians may have practised baptism by an extension of the ordinary ritual
of proselyte-making, or as a means of securing remission of sins, in the
spirit of John the Baptist, but it is extremely improbable that it was
for them the sacrament of regeneration to eternal life which it was held
to be by Greek Christians.
</p><p>Turning from the possibilities and probabilities suggested by the history
of religion to the evidence of the early literature critically studied,
two points stand out as probable. First, Jesus neither practised nor enjoined
baptism of any kind; secondly, the Antiochean missionaries always practised
baptism "in the name of the Lord Jesus." The second point is so obviously
proved both by Acts and the Pauline epistles that it requires no discussion.
The first has the limitations of the argument from silence, for it rests
on the fact that there is no trace of Baptism by Jesus, either by practice
or precept, in the synoptic gospels, except a single statement in Matt.
xxviii. 19, in which the risen Jesus is represented as commanding the disciples
to undertake the conversion of the Gentiles ( <i>ra Wvq</i> ) and their
baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. That this verse
is not historical but a late tradition, intended to support ecclesiastical
practice, is shown by the absence of the trine formula of baptism in Acts
and the Epistles, and the extreme reluctance with which the apostles, who
are sup-
</p><center>
<p>66</p></center>

<p>posed to have received this revelation, undertook a mission to the Gentiles.
"We have to choose between the account in Matthew, which makes the mission
to the Gentiles the result of the command of the risen Jesus in Galilee,
or that in Acts, confirmed by Paul, which makes it begin much later from
the preaching in Antioch of the scattered adherents of Stephen, and from
revelations to Paul and Peter, on the road to Damascus, and at Joppa. There
can be little doubt that Acts ought to be trusted on this point.
</p><p>Few problems are more obscure than the question of the growth of baptism
in the Church of this first period. This is due to the fact that the editor
of Acts was convinced that baptism was a primitive Christian custom even
in Jerusalem, though unlike Matthew he does not attribute it to Jesus.
Nevertheless, it is possible to see indications that his sources did not
confirm his opinion. An excellent case can be made for the view that the
source used in Acts i. and ii. originally regarded the gift of the Spirit
at Pentecost as the fulfillment of the promise attributed to Jesus that
his disciples, unlike those of John, should be baptized in the Holy Spirit
not in water. The exhortation of Peter in Acts ii. that his hearers should
repent <i>and be baptized</i> is so inconsistent with this promise that
it seems due to the redactor. Similarly, too, the baptism of Cornelius
seems to contradict the context of Peter's own explanation in Acts xi.,
and may well be redactorial. On the other hand, the later chapters agree
with these redactorial additions in regarding baptism as the source of
the gift of the Spirit, and there can here be no question of editorial
additions, for the references to baptism are clearly part of the fabric
of the narrative. The most illuminating evidence, however, is afforded
by the chapters describing Philip's work: in these baptism in the name
of the Lord Jesus is represented as the custom of Philip, but it does not
confer the gift of the Spirit.
</p><center>
<p>67</p></center>

<p>This may be the best clue to the historical development of the rite.
The Seven, including Philip, were probably the first to convert Gentiles,
and inasmuch as the complete breach with Judaism had not yet come, must
have regarded their converts as proselytes, and treated them accordingly.
Baptism was part of the usual treatment of a proselyte, and the formula
"in the name of the Lord Jesus" would merely distinguish these proselytes
from others.
</p><p>A little later the practice would certainly be interpreted by Greeks,
or Graeco-Orientals, in the light of the cults which they knew; baptism
would become the magical or, at least, sacramental means of salvation,
and the Name of Jesus its necessary formula. The development is exactly
similar to that passed through by the word "Lord,"—though its origin was
Jewish its interpretation was Greek.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>The expectation of immortality conferred by Baptism and membership in
the Church of the Lord Jesus varied in form. The Greek eschatology was
different from the Jewish, and looked for an immortality for each individual
immediately after death. It was, moreover, an immortality of the soul,
not of the body. Probably there were many variations of thought on the
subject. Some of the most highly educated Greeks may have understood the
arguments for and against immaterial Reality, and accepted or rejected
them. Roughly speaking, Platonists accepted, Stoics and Epicureans rejected;
and it was at least possible for Platonists, if they identified Mind with
immaterial Reality, to believe in the immortality of the human mind. But
did such Platonists actually exist before Plotinus, or possibly Ammonius
Saccus? The fragmentary evidence which exists seems to show that philosophic
Greeks were interested in other problems—mainly epistemological and psychological.
The belief in the im-

</p><center>
<p>68</p></center>

<p>mortality of the soul was preserved by the tradition of the Mysteries,<sup>1</sup>
not by the Academy.
</p><p>Stoics and Epicureans, far more important for the first century than
Academics, were materialists; but that does not mean that they did not
believe in the existence of a human soul or spirit. Spirit was for them
merely the most attenuated form of matter. The spirit of man might be dissipated
after death, as the grosser material composing his body would be, or it
might survive and retain consciousness and memory until the cycle came
round when all things, including human careers, would be repeated.
</p><p>But the first Greek Christians were scarcely influenced by an intelligent
comprehension of Stoic metaphysics, and attempts made to trace their direct
influence in Paul or elsewhere only show that their vocabulary was more
widely used than their problems were understood—a phenomenon not peculiar
to the first century. All that can be said with any confidence is that
the expectation of blessed immortality—not for all but for the chosen few—fostered
by the mysteries was probably most often conceived as the survival of the
soul after death, and the soul in turn was conceived as "Spirit," a highly
attenuated material existence, which was found until death in the body,
and was then released from it.
</p><p>In some such way the Greeks in Corinth who were converted to Christianity
expected immortality. So they did also in the other cults offering salvation.
The points of difference in Christianity are in the kind of life which
was demanded from initiates, and in the final consummation expected.
</p><p>Corinthians shows clearly that some Hellenic Christians held that having
secured immortality they were free
</p><p><sup>1</sup> From which indeed Plato had probably obtained it. He justified
it, handily enough, from his doctrine of Ideas, but scarcely derived it
thence. The triumph of Aristotle destroyed his justification, but the parent
stream flowed on placidly, undisturbed by thought.
</p><center>
<p>69</p></center>

<p>to do as they liked with their bodies. Paul insisted on the observance
of that morality which was central in Judaism. He had rendered his task
diificult by his rejection of the Law, but he won his fight, and the permanent
association of Jewish morality with the Christian Church and its Hellenic
Christology and sacraments was the result.
</p><p>In the same way Paul contended successfully for the Jewish doctrine
of a resurrection, though with some modifications. This was not the same
thing as the Greek belief in personal immortality. The Sadducees, indeed,
may have Hellenised on this subject, as did some of the Alexandrian Jews,
represented by the Wisdom of Solomon. But the bulk of the people followed
the Pharisees and looked for a resurrection of the body, at the end of
the age.
</p><p>Paul and the other missionaries continued to teach this Jewish doctrine,
but were not at once able to convince their Greek hearers that immortality
must necessarily be reached through a resurrection of the body. Presumably
the Greeks felt that immortality was sufficient, and a future reunion between
an immortal soul and a resuscitated body was as undesirable as improbable.
Paul in 1 Corinthians insists on the Jewish doctrine, but he makes the
concession to the Greeks that the resurrection will not be of flesh and
blood but of a "spiritual" body, that is to say, a body consisting of the
most attenuated form of matter. It will be the same body, but it will be
changed.
</p><p>This modified form of Jewish thought was supported by an appeal to the
case of Jesus, who had already risen from the dead. The appeal was really
far more effective than the rest of Paul's argument, which was not calculated
to convince the doubtful, and it has the special importance for the historian
that it proves that Paul did not think the risen Jesus had a body of flesh
and blood, and believed that in this he was in agreement with all the early
witnesses.
</p><center>
<p>70</p></center>

<p>Nevertheless, the belief of the Church soon affirmed what remained its
unchanged faith until the nineteenth century—the resurrection of the flesh,
both of the Lord in the past, and of the Christian in the future. This
was the triumph of Jewish thought, and is an exception to the general rule
that Christianity became steadily more Hellenic.
</p><p>The reason why Jewish thought triumphed is difficult to ascertain. Few
hypotheses as to a future life have less intrinsic probability than that
ultimately reached, which postulates an immortal soul living discarnate
until the resurrection day, when it will be reunited to its own resuscitated
body, and both will be rewarded or punished by the final judgement of God.
Nevertheless this hypothesis supplanted all others.
</p><p>Two causes may be suggested. The pressure of the Docetic controversy,
which insisted that Jesus had never been a real man of flesh and blood,
but a spirit appearing in human form, made the Church attach greater weight
to the reality of his flesh and blood, even after the resurrection. Hence
arose the narratives of the appearances of the risen Jesus in Luke and
John, emphasising this point. That they there are secondary seems to be
proved by the evidence of 1 Cor. xv. Hence, too, it may be, came the suppression
of the missing end of Mark. Following this tendency it was natural to argue,
as Paul had done, that Christians like Jesus would be raised with the same
bodies which they had had.
</p><p>A different motive was provided by moral considerations. It is clear
that there was danger, even in the Corinth of Paul's days, of men arguing
that, having obtained the Spirit and consequent immortality, nothing carnal
had any importance: the body had, as it were, but a short time, and might
be allowed to enjoy itself as it chose. To combat this danger of an absolutely
licentious position the Church maintained that the body was as
</p><center>
<p>71</p></center>

<p>eternal as the soul, and that its future happiness depended on its present
behaviour.
</p><p>Both these factors undoubtedly entered into the development of Christian
thought; and they were reinforced by the natural desire of man to preserve
the pleasures of life in a body of flesh and blood.
</p><p>The whole question of the expectation of immortality is as obscure as
it is interesting. Direct evidence in favour of a survival of individual
consciousness after death is provided in the present by psychical research,
and from the past by narratives of the apparitions of the dead, among which
the story of the appearances of the risen Jesus must be classed. To most
minds the evidence does not justify a decisive verdict of any nature.
</p><p>The "moral" argument is equally evasive. To certain minds in certain
moods it seems incredible that extinction can await beings who display
the qualities manifested by men at their best, animated by such high purposes,
so little fulfilled. In Christian circles the argument has helped to secure
the orthodox belief in the resurrection of the body. But, on the other
hand, this belief has received a succession of shocks from other considerations.
The resuscitation of the flesh has become more and more incredible. Bishop
Westcott endeavoured to meet this feeling by reviving the Pauline notion
of a body of "Spirit," and was followed by Bishop Gore in so doing. The
process was helped by the fact that in the English creed <i>resurrectio
carnis</i> is translated <i>resurrection of the body</i>, so that the denial
of the Apostles' Creed involved in the Westcott-Gore interpretation could
be softened into an apparent affirmation.
</p><p>Even more serious, though less often expressed, is the moral objection
to the judgement, which dooms men to extremes of bliss or misery in accordance
as they fall one side or the other of a certain line. The conscience of
the
</p><center>
<p>72</p></center>

<p>modern man feels that no one deserves either Heaven or Hell. Moreover,
this same conscience doubts whether any one really deserves complete perpetuation.
All men are of mixed nature; some elements seem to deserve to be eliminated,
and others to survive. Thus the moral indictment against the old expectation
of judgement is that no one deserves either of its extremes.
</p><p>A just judgement would be not between man and man, saving one and condemning
the other, but between different parts of each of us. For in man good and
evil are always present: what we ask for is not complete survival, but
the ultimate elimination of some parts and the constant growth of others;
we desire change, not permanence.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, even in the short
space of life which we can observe, elimination and selection are clearly
present. The child and the old man are one, not by identity but by continuity
of life. The main object of education is to further and confirm this beneficent
change. Once more, this, or something like it, is often put forward as
the meaning of the doctrine of "judgement." But when the creed states that
Jesus will "come again in glory to judge both the quick and dead," it means
the Jewish eschatological expectation, and to use its language to express
modern thought is unfair to both.
</p><p>All such thoughts are <i>a priori</i>, and can never convince the reluctant.
The path of wisdom is not to weigh the merits of various inconclusive arguments,
but to distinguish between Desire and Knowledge.
</p><p>Desire for most men is to remain essentially as they are. The healthy
enjoy life, and even the unhealthy cling to it. If we are candid most of
us admit that we should like indefinitely prolonged existence, that we
have an infinite curiosity to know what is going to happen in the world,
and a wish to take part in its development. That is Desire.
</p><p><sup>1</sup> This has much in common with Origen's teaching, but unfortunately
Origen, was rejected by the Catholic Church.
</p><center>
<p>73</p></center>

<p>Over against Desire is Knowledge. We know that matter is indestructible,
though it changes its form, and that energy is equally indestructible,
but constantly varies its form. If Life be similar to energy this gives
us reason to believe that it is permanent, but that its form changes. If,
however, Life be a form of Energy, not a force similar to it, there is
no reason to expect its permanence. The chief reason against this view
is that whereas we can convert heat into electricity, or electricity into
light, we cannot—as yet—convert either into Life.
</p><p>So far Knowledge takes us on the hypothesis that Life is material, for
Energy is not outside of the world of matter. But still within the field
of Knowledge is the old problem of Immaterial Reality and its relation
to Life. To those who are convinced, as I am myself, by the old arguments
in favour of Immaterial Reality, conceivable but not imaginable, it is
certain that intellectual and moral life belongs to it and shares its attributes
of eternity. Metaphysics are more convincing than psychology. But need
this mean that this eternal life is personal? No one as yet has answered
this question.
</p><p>And there are further considerations: all that we know of life teaches
us that it is a succession of losses. The passage from youth to middle
life, and the change from middle life to old age are losses, from which
we shrink. No man willingly surrenders the flexibility of youth or the
power of middle life. But the experience—shrunk from and postponed though
it be—teaches that through loss came gain. Yet none of us ever foresaw
the form which the gain would take. After old age comes death: that too
is loss. Is it also gain? If Life continue, and that at least seems probable,
Knowledge teaches us that it will change its form and that here, too, gain
will come through loss. But, it is often said, this is the denial of the
survival of personality, and it is personality, not life, which we desire.
No doubt we do: but we desire to keep
</p><center>
<p>74</p></center>

<p>much which we lose, and yet come to see that only thus could we achieve
the greater gain.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>After all, Faith is not belief in spite of evidence, but life in scorn
of consequence—a courageous trust in the great purpose of all things and
pressing forward to finish the work which is in sight, whatever the price
may be. Who knows whether the "personality" of which men talk so much and
know so little may not prove to be the temporary limitation rather than
the necessary expression of Life?
</p><p>There was once an archipelago of islands off a mountainous coast separated
from each other and from the mainland by the sea. But in course of time
the sea dried up, the islands were joined to the great mountain behind
them, and it became clear that they had always been united by solid ground
under a very shallow sea. If those islands could have thought and spoken
what would they have said? Before the event they would have protested against
losing their insularity, but would they have done so afterwards, when the
water which divided them from each other was gone, and they knew that they
were part of the great mountain which before they had, only dimly seen,
obscured by the mists rising from the sea?
