Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan, and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</td>

"Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath? make, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have a father -- Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham; and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree, therefore, not making good fruit is cut down, and to fire it is cast."
</td><td>Mt 3:7b-9.<BR>
"Brood of vipers! who did shew you to flee from the coming wrath? bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham, and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast."

"I indeed with water do baptise you, but he cometh who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire; whose winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat to his storehouse, and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
</td><td>Mt 3:11-13<BR>
"I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."

And it came to pass, in all the people being baptised, Jesus also being baptised, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance, as if a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, "Thou art My Son -- the Beloved, in thee I did delight."
</td><td>Mt 3:13-17<BR>
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him, but John was forbidding him, saying, "I have need by thee to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me!"  But Jesus answering said to him, "Suffer now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,' then he doth suffer him. And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him, and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, "This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight."

<td><B>Lk 4:1-13</B><BR>
And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from the Jordan, and was brought in the Spirit to the wilderness, forty days being tempted by the Devil, and he did not eat anything in those days, and they having been ended, he afterward hungered, and the Devil said to him, "If Son thou art of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread." And Jesus answered him, saying, "It hath been written, that, not on bread only shall man live, but on every saying of God." And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain, shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and the Devil said to him, "To thee I will give all this authority, and their glory, because to me it hath been delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I do give it; thou, then, if thou mayest bow before me -- all shall be thine." And Jesus answering him said, "Get thee behind me, Adversary, for it hath been written, Thou shalt bow before the Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve." And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, "If the Son thou art of God, cast thyself down hence, for it hath been written -- To His messengers He will give charge concerning thee, to guard over thee, and -- On hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot." And Jesus answering said to him -- "It hath been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." And having ended all temptation, the Devil departed from him till a convenient season.
</td><td>Mt 4:1-11<BR>
Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil, and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger. And the Tempter having come to him said, "If Son thou art of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves." But he answering said, "It hath been written, Not upon bread alone doth man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God." Then doth the Devil take him to the holy city, and doth set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and saith to him, "If Son thou art of God -- cast thyself down, for it hath been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up, that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot."  Jesus said to him again, "It hath been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount, and doth shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and saith to him, "All these to thee I will give, if falling down thou mayest bow to me." Then saith Jesus to him, "Go -- Adversary, for it hath been written, The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou shalt serve." Then doth the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.

And he, having lifted up his eyes to his disciples, said: "Happy the poor -- because yours is the reign of God. Happy those hungering now -- because ye shall be filled. Happy those weeping now -- because ye shall laugh. Happy are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach, and shall cast forth your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake -- rejoice in that day, and leap, for lo, your reward is great in the heaven, for according to these things were their fathers doing to the prophets. But wo to you -- the rich, because ye have got your comfort. Wo to you who have been filled -- because ye shall hunger. Wo to you who are laughing now -- because ye shall mourn and weep. Wo to you when all men shall speak well of you -- for according to these things were their fathers doing to false prophets."
</td><td>Mt 5:2-12<BR>
And having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying: "Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens. Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted. Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land. Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled. Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness. Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God. Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God. Happy those persecuted for righteousness' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens. Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake -- rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward is great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you."

"But I say to you who are hearing, Love your enemies, do good to those hating you, bless those cursing you, and pray for those accusing you falsely; and to him smiting thee upon the cheek, give also the other, and from him taking away from thee the mantle, also the coat thou mayest not keep back. And to every one who is asking of thee, be giving; and from him who is taking away thy goods, be not asking again; and as ye wish that men may do to you, do ye also to them in like manner; and -- if ye love those loving you, what grace have ye? for also the sinful love those loving them; and if ye do good to those doing good to you, what grace have ye? for also the sinful do the same; and if ye lend to those of whom ye hope to receive back, what grace have ye? for also the sinful lend to sinners -- that they may receive again as much. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again, and your reward will be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest, because He is kind unto the ungracious and evil; be ye therefore merciful, as also your Father is merciful."
</td><td>Mt 5:38-48<BR>
"Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other; and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and thy coat to take -- suffer to him also the cloak. And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two, to him who is asking of thee be giving, and him who is willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away. Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine enemy; but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you falsely, and persecuting you, that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth send rain on righteous and unrighteous. For, if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye? do not also the tax-gatherers the same? and if ye may salute your brethren only, what do ye abundant? do not also the tax-gatherers so? ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who is in the heavens is perfect."

"And judge not, and ye may not be judged; condemn not, and ye may not be condemned; release, and ye shall be released. Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed, and shaken, and running over, they shall give into your bosom; for with that measure with which ye measure, it shall be measured to you again." And he spake a simile to them, "Is blind able to lead blind? shall they not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above his teacher, but every one perfected shall be as his teacher. And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and the beam that is in thine own eye dost not consider? or how art thou able to say to thy brother, Brother, suffer, I may take out the mote that is in thine eye -- thyself the beam in thine own eye not beholding? Hypocrite, take first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to take out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."

"Judge not, that ye may not be judged, for in what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and in what measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you. And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and the beam that is in thine own eye dost not consider? or, how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye, and lo, the beam is in thine own eye? Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."

"For there is not a good tree making bad fruit, nor a bad tree making good fruit; for each tree from its own fruit is known, for not from thorns do they gather figs, nor from a bramble do they crop a grape. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which is evil; for out of the abounding of the heart doth his mouth speak."
</td><td>Mt 7:16-20<BR>
"From their fruits ye shall know them; do men gather from thorns grapes? or from thistles figs? so every good tree doth yield good fruits, but the bad tree doth yield evil fruits. A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits, nor a bad tree to yield good fruits. Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire: therefore from their fruits ye shall know them."
<P>
Mt 12:33-35<BR>
"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad, for from the fruit is the tree known. Brood of vipers! how are ye able to speak good things -- being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart doth the mouth speak. The good man out of the good treasure of the heart doth put forth the good things, and the evil man out of the evil treasure doth put forth evil things."

"Every one who is coming unto me, and is hearing my words, and is doing them, I will shew you to whom he is like; he is like to a man building a house, who did dig, and deepen, and laid a foundation upon the rock, and a flood having come, the stream broke forth on that house, and was not able to shake it, for it had been founded upon the rock. And he who heard and did not, is like to a man having builded a house upon the earth, without a foundation, against which the stream brake forth, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house became great."
</td><td>Mt 7:24-27<BR>
"Therefore, every one who doth hear of me these words, and doth do them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock; and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock. And every one who is hearing of me these words, and is not doing them, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell, and its fall was great."

And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he went into Capernaum; and a certain centurion's servant being ill, was about to die, who was much valued by him, and having heard about Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, beseeching him, that having come he might thoroughly save his servant. And they, having come near unto Jesus, were calling upon him earnestly, saying -- "He is worthy to whom thou shalt do this, for he doth love our nation, and the synagogue he did build to us." And Jesus was going on with them, and now when he is not far distant from the house the centurion sent unto him friends, saying to him, "Sir, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that under my roof thou mayest enter; wherefore not even myself thought I worthy to come unto thee, but say in a word, and my lad shall be healed; for I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Be coming, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it." And having heard these things Jesus wondered at him, and having turned to the multitude following him, he said, "I say to you, not even in Israel so much faith did I find;" and those sent, having turned back to the house, found the ailing servant in health.
</td><td>Mt 8:5-13<BR>
And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion calling upon him, and saying, "Sir, my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully afflicted," and Jesus saith to him, "I, having come, will heal him." And the centurion answering said, "Sir, I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my servant shall be healed; for I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Be coming, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it." And Jesus having heard, did wonder, and said to those following, "Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great faith have I found; and I say to you, that many from east and west shall come and recline (at meat) with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the reign of the heavens, but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer darkness -- there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth." And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and as thou didst believe let it be to thee;" and his young man was healed in that hour.

And the disciples of John told him about all these things, and John having called near a certain two of his disciples, sent unto Jesus, saying, "Art thou he who is coming, or for another do we look?" And having come near to him, the men said, "John the Baptist sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he who is coming, or for another do we look?" And in that hour he cured many from sicknesses, and plagues, and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight. And Jesus answering said to them, "Having gone on, report to John what ye saw and heard, that blind men do see again, lame do walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf do hear, dead are raised, poor have good news proclaimed; and happy is he whoever may not be stumbled in me."

And John having heard in the prison the works of the Christ, having sent two of his disciples, said to him, "Art thou He who is coming, or for another do we look?"

"But what have ye gone forth to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet: this is he concerning whom it hath been written, Lo, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee; for I say to you, a greater prophet, among those born of women, than John the Baptist there is not; but the least in the reign of God is greater than he."

And as they are going, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "What went ye out to the wilderness to view? -- a reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? -- a man clothed in soft garments? lo, those wearing the soft things are in the kings' houses. But what went ye out to see? -- a prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet, for this is he of whom it hath been written, Lo, I do send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

Think ye that peace I came to give in the earth? no, I say to you, but rather division; for there shall be henceforth five in one house divided -- three against two, and two against three; a father shall be divided against a son, and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter, and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."

And the servant said, Sir, it hath been done as thou didst command, and still there is room.

Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Say to those who have been called: Lo, my dinner I prepared, my oxen and the fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready, come ye to the marriage-feasts; and they, having disregarded it, went away, the one to his own field, and the other to his merchandise; and the rest, having laid hold on his servants, did insult and slay them. And the king having heard, was wroth, and having sent forth his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers, and their city he set on fire; then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast indeed is ready, and those called were not worthy, be going, then, on to the cross-ways, and as many as ye may find, call ye to the marriage-feasts.
