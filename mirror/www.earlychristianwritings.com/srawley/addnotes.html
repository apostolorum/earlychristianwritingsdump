 ADDITIONAL NOTES&nbsp;</b>

 <b>
 (I) 
		THE HERESIES IN THE CHURCHES OF ASIA.&nbsp;</b>
        <p align="left">
 A<span style="font-variant: small-caps">LL</span> the epistles, with the exception of 
		those to the Romans and to Polycarp, contain warnings against heresy. In the 
		epistles to the Magnesians and Philadelphians Ignatius deals with a Judaistic 
		error, which showed itself in a return to the ceremonialism of the Jewish
        law 
		and in a setting up of the authority of the Old Testament against the Gospel
        (Magn. 8, 9, 10; Philad. 6, 8, 9). The epistle to the Philadelphians exhibits 
		the more developed form of this tendency. In the epistles to the Trallians and
        Smyrnaeans Ignatius opposes a Docetic error which denied the reality of the 
		birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and maintained that our Lord's 
		body was a mere phantom. Cf. esp. Trall. 9, 10; Smyrn. 1, 2, 3. We see the more 
		developed form of this tendency in the epistle to the Smyrnaeans. In both cases 
		the false teaching had led finally to schism (Philad. 2, 3, 7; Smyrn. 6, 8, 9). 
		From some references to Docetism in the epistles to the Magnesians and 
		Philadelphians (Magn. 8, 9, 11; Philad. inscr., 3 (end), 4, 5) Lightfoot 
		assumes that the two errors co-existed in some form of Docetic Judaism, which 
		Ignatius attacks from different sides in the different epistles. This is also 
		the view of Lipsius and Zahn, but it has been challenged by Hort (<i>Judaistic
        Christianity</i>, pp. 181-187) and Harnack (<i>Expositor</i>, March 1886, and
        <i>Chronologie</i>, 
		pp. 389 n., 393). An intermediate view is held by Von der Goltz, <i> Texte u.
 Unters.</i>, Bd. xii. 3.
		<p align="left">
 There are no references to Judaism in the epistles to
		<p align="center">
 110
		<p align="left">
 the Ephesians, Trallians, and Smyrnaeans (unless we regard 
		as such the references to the prophets and the law of Moses in Smyrn. 5, 7).&nbsp;
        There the error is simply Docetic. The reference in Magn. 8 to 'strange 
		doctrines' and 'ancient fables' probably refers to Rabbinical fables rather 
		than to Gnostic myths (see notes on the passage).&nbsp; In Magn. 9 and Philad.
        inscr. 
		there are apparently references to Docetism.&nbsp; In the former of the two passages, 
		after speaking of 'our life' as having 'its rising through Him and His 
		death,' Ignatius adds a parenthetical clause beginning, 'which fact some deny.'&nbsp;
        The parenthesis, however, forms no part of his argument. In the second passage 
		Ignatius speaks of the Philadelphian Church as 'rejoicing in the passion of 
		our Lord and in His resurrection,' where his language may contain, as Lightfoot 
		thinks, an allusion to the Docetic denial of the Passion.&nbsp; But in any case 
		neither passage contains more than an incidental reference to errors which were 
		prominent in the writer's thoughts at the time. In Magn. 11, after the 
		conclusion of the attack on the Judaistic teachers contained in cc. 8-10, 
		Ignatius bids them 'be fully convinced of the birth and passion and 
		resurrection, which came to pass in the time of the government of Pontius 
		Pilate—events which truly and certainly were brought to pass by Jesus Christ.'&nbsp;
        But the words do not necessarily form a part of the attack contained in cc. 
		8-10.&nbsp; Ignatius may be merely thinking of the dangers to which other churches 
		were exposed, and warning the Magnesians beforehand against them. But the most 
		valuable piece of evidence is the epistle to the Philadelphians. Ignatius had 
		visited this Church, and in addressing it he plainly refers to actually 
		existing errors, of which he had personal experience. Here, if anywhere, we 
		might expect to find traces of a mixture of Judaism and Docetism. Yet besides 
		the passage which we have already quoted the only passages appealed to by
        Lightfoot are cc. 3 (end), 4, 5.&nbsp;
		<p align="left">
 In the first of these Ignatius says, 'If any 
		man walks in strange opinions, he has no part in the Passion.'&nbsp; In the second he 
		bids them partake of one Eucharist, as
		<p align="center">
        112
		<p align="left">
        there is one flesh 
		of Christ. Both these passages may quite easily refer to the separatist 
		tendencies of heresy generally, as cutting men off from the unity of the Church 
		and the benefits of the Passion of Christ.&nbsp; In c. 5 Ignatius speaks of himself 
		as 'taking refuge in the Gospel as the flesh of Jesus.'&nbsp; Here again the 
		allusion is too slight to convey any distinct controversial sense.&nbsp;
        Had Ignatius 
		been confronted with a form of heresy which combined Judaic and Docetic 
		features, it is difficult to believe that his language would have been so vague 
		and indirect.
		<p align="left">
        Thus the language of the epistles does not require us to suppose 
		that a form of Docetic Judaism was generally current in the churches.&nbsp;
        Both 
		Docetic and Judaistic influences were undoubtedly present to the mind of 
		Ignatius when he wrote his epistles. But whether in any particular church the 
		one or the other, or both in combination, were found, depends upon the internal 
		evidence of each epistle. From what we know of the foreign influences which had 
		invaded the Jews of the Dispersion in the first and second centuries, it is not
        <i> 
		a priori</i> unlikely that such a combination might exist, but it would require 
		much stronger language than that of the passages Magn. 9, 11; Philad. 3, 8;
        Smyrn. 5, 7, to demonstrate its presence in the three churches addressed in 
		those epistles. It is only natural to suppose that the memory of the dangers 
		arising from both forms of error would colour the thought and language of 
		Ignatius at the time, even when he was writing to churches not directly in 
		danger. The remaining epistles show no trace of a combination of the two 
		errors.
		<p align="left">
        The Docetic heresy arose out of the oriental mystical spirit, which 
		found a difficulty in believing in the contact of the Supreme God with matter. 
		There are traces of a similar heresy in the false teaching alluded to in
        1 John 
		iv. 3, 2 John 7, and in Polycarp's epistle to the Philippians (c. 7). The 
		Johannine epistles, however, probably have in view the teaching of Cerinthus, 
		which was not properly Docetic. The Docetism attacked in the present epistles 
		was 'thorough-going.'
		<p align="center">
 113
		<p align="left">
 It was applied to the whole earthly 
		life of our Lord from the Birth to the Resurrection.
		<p align="left">
        This is a sign of early 
		date, as Docetism tended to become modified as time went on. This
        'thorough-going' Docetism finds a parallel in the teaching of Saturnilus, who 
		was a contemporary and fellow-citizen of Ignatius. The epistles contain no 
		traces of the features of the later Gnostic systems of Valentinus,
        Basilides, 
		and Marcion.
		<p align="left">
        The Jewish or Ebionite heresy was a development of the Pharisaic 
		Judaism, of which we see the beginnings in the teaching attacked by St. Paul in 
		the Epistle to the Galatians. It appears, however, that circumcision was no 
		longer insisted on, for in Philad. 6 we read, 'It is better to hear 
		Christianity from one who is circumcised, than to hear Judaism from an 
		uncircumcised man.' This is in accordance with what we know of the later 
		development of this heresy.
		<p align="left">
        Both forms of heresy were dishonouring to the 
		Person of Christ. Docetism denied the reality of His Manhood.&nbsp; Ebionism started 
		from an imperfect conception of His Person, and ended by denying His Divinity.&nbsp;
        Both alike found a stumbling-block in the Passion, with its teaching of a 
		Divine sufferer and a crucified Messiah. Both heresies in their developed form 
		(see above) resulted in separatism, and gave occasion to an emphatic assertion 
		by Ignatius of the unity of the Church.&nbsp;
		<p align="center">
 <b>
 (II) THE ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THE 
		CHRISTIAN MINISTRY.&nbsp;</b>
		<p align="left">
 T<span style="font-variant: small-caps">HE</span> statement in the Introduction, § iv. pp. 32 f., that in 
		the New Testament and the early sub-apostolic writers the words 'bishop' and 'presbyter' are applied to the same person represents a fact which did not 
		escape the notice of Church writers in ancient times. One attempt to explain 
		the transfer of the name 'bishop' to the single monarchical ruler of the 
		Ignatian epistles and
		<p align="center">
 114
		<p align="left">
 later times is that of Theodore of 
		Mopsuestia in the fifth century. According to this writer the Church officers 
		who are now called bishops were formerly called apostles, and ruled not single 
		churches, but whole provinces. He represents St. Paul as appointing Timothy to 
		rule the province of Asia and Titus to rule over Crete. But when the original 
		Apostles passed away, their successors, recognizing that they fell far short of 
		them in the character of their gifts and in other ways, shrank from retaining 
		the name 'apostle,' and chose instead the name of 'bishop,' reserving the word 
		'presbyter' to the inferior office which now bears that name.&nbsp; As bishops were 
		multiplied, not only were they appointed to particular towns and provinces, but 
		each locality came to have its own bishop.[1] This theory is criticized by Bishop 
		Lightfoot (<i>Philippians</i>, p. 195 f.)&nbsp; The Apostles, whether we use the term of the 
		Twelve and St. Paul, or in the wider sense of the original founders of 
		Churches, held no localized office. They were missionaries and moved about from 
		place to place. Moreover the statement of Theodore that episcopacy spread from 
		the provincial area to the smaller localities is not borne out by facts. The 
		epistles of Ignatius prove the contrary, and show that the bishop's office was 
		not in any sense 'diocesan.'&nbsp; The germ of truth contained in Theodore's 
		statement is the fact that the missionary Apostles of the first days exercised 
		a general supervision over the churches which they founded, and that the 
		supreme power of this general and itinerant ministry came eventually into the 
		hands of the single 'bishop' who belonged to the local ministry.[2]
		<p align="left">
 In modern 
		times discussion has largely turned on the relationship between this general 
		ministry of the first Apostles and the local ministry of presbyters (or 
		presbyter-bishops) and deacons which preceded the threefold ministry as we see 
		it in Ignatius.
		<p align="left">
 Bishop Lightfoot in his essay on 'The Christian Ministry' (<i>Philippians</i>, pp. 181 f.) starts with the repre-
        <blockquote>
		<p align="left" style="background-color: #C0C0C0">

		<p align="center">

		<p align="left">
 sentation in Acts of the Twelve as the 'sole directors and administrators of 
		the Church.'&nbsp; Owing to the increasing burden of work, the less important 
		functions were soon delegated to others.&nbsp; First came the appointment of the 
		Seven (Acts vi.) in whose office he sees a correspondence with the later
        diaconate, though the name 'deacon' is not used).[1]&nbsp; The next stage, the 
		appearance of the office of presbyters, first comes to light (Acts xi. 30) in 
		close connection with the persecution of Herod, which appears to have led to 
		the dispersion of the Twelve. Henceforth we read of presbyters as directing the 
		affairs of the Church at Jerusalem. The office may have been created on the 
		analogy of the 'elders' of the Jewish synagogue.&nbsp; But, once created, it extended 
		to other regions, and Paul and Barnabas are represented on their first 
		missionary journey as establishing presbyters in the churches which they 
		founded (Acts xiv. 23). The term 'bishop' first appears in connection with 
		Gentile Churches, and then as a synonym for 'presbyter.'&nbsp; Whether it was 
		adopted from the analogy of the similar title applied to the directors of Greek 
		religious and social clubs (as Dr. Hatch supposed) cannot be determined. But 
		the name is applied in one passage (Acts xx. 28) to those who have previously 
		been spoken of as 'presbyters' (the 'elders' of Ephesus, see v. 17), while 
		elsewhere (Phil. i.1) 'bishops' are spoken of, along with 'deacons,' in a way 
		that suggests that presbyters are referred to. Similarly in the Pastoral 
		Epistles Lightfoot urges that the same identification is to be made (see Tit.
 i. 5, 7; 1 Tim. iii. 1-7). Presbyters appear in 1 Pet. v. 5 and also in James 
		v. 14. The same terminology appears when we pass outside the New Testament to 
		the sub-apostolic period.&nbsp; In Clement of Rome and the <i> Didache</i> we read of 'bishops and deacons' (Clement,
 <i> ad Cor</i>. 42, <i> Didache</i> 15)—though the former uses 'bishop' and 'presbyter' as convertible terms (cp.
 <i> ad Cor</i>. 44)—and in Polycarp (<i>ad Philipp.</i> 5, 6) 'presbyters and deacons.' On the strength of this
        <blockquote>
		<p align="left" style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
 [1] The 
		words &#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; and &#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#945; ('serve,' 'ministration') are, however, used in 
		this connection. See Acts vi. 1, 2.
        </blockquote>
		<p align="center">

		<p align="left">
 evidence Lightfoot 
		holds that the local churches were under the direction of presbyter-bishops, 
		whose function was to rule and teach, and that the monarchical episcopate was 
		developed out of this subordinate office. In the position of St. James at 
		Jerusalem (see esp. Acts xxi. 18, cf. Introd. p. 33) he sees the pattern and 
		precedent of this later development; and in the activity of St. John at 
		Ephesus, according to the tradition preserved by Clement of Alexandria and 
		Tertullian (see note on Trall. 7), he would see one of the main agencies in 
		extending an organization which had been adopted in the mother church of 
		Jerusalem.<p align="left">The discovery of the <i> Didache</i> (or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles), 
		published by Bryennios in 1883, subsequent to the appearance of Lightfoot's 
		essay, led to a fresh review of the history of the ministry. In this work, side 
		by side with the local ministry of 'bishops and deacons,' we find itinerant 
		apostles, prophets, and teachers, who visit the churches. The apostle is to be 
		received as the Lord, but may not stay more than three days. Provision is made 
		for prophets and teachers who wish to settle down in the community. The prophet 
		when speaking in the spirit is to be above criticism. He is allowed to use 
		extempore prayer when 'giving thanks,' and first-fruits are to be assigned to 
		him, for, says the writer, 'they (the prophets) are your high-priests.'&nbsp;
        At the 
		same time bishops and deacons, whom they are bidden to elect for themselves, 
		are not to be despised, but are to be held in honour along with the prophets 
		and teachers, whose ministry they also exercise.&nbsp; In this itinerant ministry of 
		apostles, prophets, and teachers Harnack[1] sees a survival of an earlier 
		teaching ministry, which owed its position, not to appointment by the Church, 
		but to a special gift of inspiration, which enabled its possessors to 'speak 
		the word of God,' and he contrasts this earlier 'charismatic'[2] ministry, to
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left" style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] 
		See Prolegomena to edition of <i> Didache</i> in <i> Texte u.
          Untersuchungen</i> (1884), and <i> 
		Constitution and Law of the Church in the first two centuries</i> (E. tr. 1910).<br>
          [2] 
		This use of the term 'charismatic' is criticized by Dean
        </blockquote>
        <p align="center">117<p align="left">which he attributes the most important influence in the direction of the early 
		church, with the purely administrative local ministry of presbyters (or 
		bishops) and deacons, who derived their appointment from the community. As the 
		older charismatic ministry declined or fell into disrepute (the <i> Didache</i> 
		contains warnings against 'false prophets'), the local ministry stepped into 
		its place and exercised many of its functions. This theory has recently been 
		discussed by the Dean of Wells (Dr. Armitage Robinson) in the volume of essays 
		on <i> The Early History of the Church and Ministry</i> (pp. 59 ff.). He criticizes 
		Harnack for reading back into the New Testament the conditions implied in the
        <i>Didache</i>, and for the use which he makes in support of his theory of such 
		passages as 1 Cor. xii. 28, Eph. iv. 11 (which refer to functions rather than 
		offices), and he denies that prophets and teachers in the New Testament stand 
		out (along with apostles) as a definite official class, superior to the local 
		presbyters, and exercising a ministry to the universal church. The conditions 
		in the <i>Didache</i>, on the contrary, point to a stage at which the gift of 
		prophecy, which in the Acts and Epistles is represented as a personal 
		endowment, has become the badge of a professional class, with the attendant 
		dangers of self-exaltation and deception. With Lightfoot it is reasonable to 
		see in the 'helps' and 'governments' of 1 Cor. xii. 28, and the 'pastors and 
		teachers' of Eph. iv. 11, an allusion to the permanent ministry of the Church, 
		even though this is overshadowed by the more conspicuous gifts which were 
		needed for the conversion of unbelievers and the founding of churches. These 
		humbler offices had, too, their own charisma, or gift of the Holy Spirit, as we 
		see from Acts xx. 28 and the language of the Pastoral Epistles (1 Tim. iv. 14; 
		2 Tim. i. 6).<p align="left">Later discussions have somewhat modified Lightfoot's statement 
		that the terms ' presbyter' and ' bishop' were

		History of Church and Ministry</i>, edited by Dr. Swete (1918).

        <p align="center">118<p align="left">synonymous.&nbsp; Dr. Hort (<i>Christian
        Ecclesia</i>, pp. 190 ff.) maintained that the word 
		'bishop' was not a mere synonym, but denoted a function exercised by the 
		presbyter—the function of 'oversight.'&nbsp; More recent scholars [1] have maintained a 
		distinction between the presbyter and the 'bishop.'&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this view the 
		word 'elders' ('presbyters') is used in our early sources in a more general and 
		in a more particular sense. On the one hand, there is a wider class of 'elders' who are contrasted with the younger members of the community
        (1 Tim. v. 1; 1 Pet. v. 5; cf. Tit. ii. 2-6).&nbsp; On the other hand, there are 'elders' who 
		rule (1 Tim. v. 17), and who are probably to be identified with the 'rulers' of 
		Rom. xii. 28, 1 Thess. v. 12, Heb. xiii. 7.&nbsp; These latter have an official 
		status; and they are appointed (cf. Acts xiv. 23, Tit. i. 5, Clement of Rome,
        <i> 
		ad Cor</i>. 54). In the Church of Jerusalem they appear to have acted as an 
		advisory and ruling council (Acts xi. 30, xv. 4, xxi. 18). Some of them at 
		least exercised pastoral duties (1 Pet. v. 2) and were occupied in the ministry 
		of the word and teaching (1 Tim. v. 17; Heb. xiii. 7).&nbsp; These facts explain 
		their position in the Ignatian epistles, where they appear as a 'council' 
		associated with the bishop.<p align="left">According to this view 'bishops' would be selected 
		from, and appointed by, the official presbyters to execute certain functions. 
		The evidence of our sources suggests that these functions were threefold: (i) 
		the representation of the local church in its external relations with other 
		churches. Of this we have an illustration in the position occupied by Clement 
		of Rome, who writes to the Corinthians to protest against the wrongful 
		dismissal of some presbyters as a violation of church order. Similarly Hermas (<i>Vis</i>. ii. 4) is instructed to send one copy of his book to Clement, who is to 'send it to the foreign cities, for this is his duty.'<p align="left">(2) Closely connected 
		with the previous function is the administration of the finances of the Church. 
		This would be necessary in view of the duty of providing
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left" style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] See, <i>e.g.</i>, Bernard,
          <i> 
		Pastoral Epp</i>. pp. lvi ff;&nbsp; Harnack, <i> Constitution and Law of the
          Church</i>, pp. 67 
		f., 69 f.
        </blockquote>
        <p align="center"> 119<p align="left">hospitality for those who came from other 
		churches, and of supervising the charities of the Church.&nbsp; Hence we find the 
		injunction that the bishop be 'given to hospitality' (1 Tim. iii. 2; Tit. i. 
		8), while in Justin (<i>Ap</i>. i, 67) the money collected for orphans and widows is 
		to be deposited with 'the president.'<p align="left">(3) Lastly, there is the connection of 
		the bishop with the worship of the Church, centring in the celebration of the 
		Eucharist. Thus in the <i> Didache</i> (c. 15) the election of 'bishops and deacons' 
		is referred to in connexion with the Eucharist, and in Clement of Rome (c. 44) 
		the 'offering of the gifts' (<i>i. e</i>. in the Eucharist) is spoken of as a 
		function of the bishop's office (cf. Ignatius, Smyrn. 8).<p align="left">In the matters of 
		finance and worship we find the deacons closely associated with the 'bishop,' 
		and similar qualifications are required of them both (cf. 1 Tim. iii. 3, 8;
        <i> 
		Didache</i> 15).&nbsp; Deacons are closely associated with the 'president' in Justin's 
		account of the Eucharist (<i>Ap</i>. i. 65, 67).&nbsp; The position of the Seven in Acts vi. 
		1-6 is an early indication of a similar function with regard to finance.<p align="left">According to this view, while all bishops would be presbyters, all presbyters 
		would not necessarily be bishops, as the latter, though chosen from the former, 
		had functions of their own, though we cannot always sharply distinguish between 
		the duties fulfilled by each. Teaching and the ministry of the word are 
		assigned to both presbyters and bishops (1 Tim. v. 17 ; 1 Tim. iii. 2); in the
        <i> 
		Didache</i> (c. 15) bishops and deacons are said to 'minister the ministry of 
		prophets and teachers'; and Hermas (<i>Vis</i>. iii. 5) similarly connects bishops and 
		deacons with apostles and teachers.<p align="left">The distinction between bishops and 
		presbyters which has been drawn above does not, however, alter the fact that 
		there were several 'bishops ' in each local church. The stages by which the 
		single bishop came to be supreme in the local church are hidden from us. The 
		development was not uniform in all churches. When the Apostles, who had 
		exercised a general supervision<p align="center">120<p align="left">over the churches founded 
		by them passed away, the colleges of ruling presbyters established by them in 
		the various churches would feel the need of a president, who could act as an 
		executive official, as the presiding minister at the Eucharist, and as the 
		representative of the church in its external relations.<p align="left">Ignatius nowhere speaks 
		of the bishops as 'succeeding to' the Apostles.&nbsp; The idea, however, of a 'succession' in the ministry and the belief that the Apostles had provided for 
		it are found in Clement of Rome (<i>ad Cor</i>. 44).[1]&nbsp; Ignatius, on the other hand, 
		emphasizes the importance of the bishop as the centre of unity in the local 
		church (Smyrn. 8), while the unity of the church universal finds its organ of 
		expression in 'the bishops established in the furthest quarters,' who are 'in 
		the mind of Jesus Christ,' as Jesus Christ is 'the Mind of the Father' (Eph. 
		3).<p align="left">Thus the local ministry, established in the first instance by the 
		missionary apostles of early days, though obscured for a time by the more 
		striking and exceptional endowments of missionary prophets and teachers, when 
		these had passed away, gathered into itself the permanent powers of the 
		apostolate, and in the episcopate provided the Church with an organ for the 
		expression of the unity of the whole.<p align="center"><b>(Ill) THE ACTS OF THE MARTYRDOM OF ST. 
		IGNATIUS.</b><p align="left">T<span style="font-variant: small-caps">HE</span> story of the martyrdom of Ignatius is current in five different 
		forms.
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left">1. The Antiochene Acts, current in Greek, Latin, and Syriac.<br>
          2. The 
		Roman Acts, current in Greek and Coptic.<br>
          3. The Bollandist Acts (Latin).<br>
          4. The 
		Armenian Acts.<br>
          5. The Acts of Symeon the Metaphrast (Greek).<p align="left" style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] On the history 
		of the idea of 'apostolic succession' see the essay by C. H. Turner in <i> Essays 
		on the Early History of the Church and Ministry</i> (edited by Dr. Swete), pp. 95 
		ff.
        </blockquote>
        <p align="center"> 121<p align="left">Of these the last three forms show their dependence 
		upon (1) and (2), the narratives of which they combine in various ways. On the 
		other hand the Antiochene and Roman Acts are plainly independent. Hence our 
		attention may be confined to them.<p align="left">The <i> Roman Acts</i> are the longer of the two 
		forms, and exhibit a more developed legendary character than we find in the 
		Antiochene Acts. According to the account which they contain, the trial before 
		Trajan took place at Rome in the presence of the Senate. A long dialogue ensues 
		between Trajan and Ignatius, in which the Senate occasionally intervenes. 
		Trajan at first makes overtures to his prisoner and promises to appoint him 
		high-priest of Zeus and give him a share in his kingdom, if he will abjure 
		Christianity and sacrifice to the gods. As this proves unavailing, he threatens 
		him with various forms of torture. On his part Ignatius heaps ridicule on the 
		heathen gods and vindicates Christianity. After torture has proved unavailing, 
		Trajan orders him to be left in prison without food for three days and then to 
		be cast to the wild beasts. On the third day Trajan, attended by the Senate and 
		the prefect, proceeds to the amphitheatre, where a great concourse is 
		assembled. The endurance of the martyr excites the Emperor's wonder, and as he 
		is still obdurate, the final sentence is carried out, and the wild beasts are 
		let loose upon him. The beasts, however, only crushed him to death, without 
		touching his flesh, 'so that his reliques might be a means of protection to 
		the great city of the Romans, in which Peter also was crucified and Paul was 
		beheaded and Onesimus was perfected ' (c. 10).<p align="left">Trajan is amazed at the 
		circumstances of the martyr's death, and receiving about the same time letters 
		from Pliny the governor with reference to the Christians, he issues a decree 
		ordering that the Christians should not be sought out, but only punished when 
		found. At the same time he permits the burial of the martyr's reliques. 'Then,' we read, 'the brethren in Rome, to whom also he had sent word that they 
		should not sue for his deliverance from martyrdom and so rob him of the hope&nbsp;<p align="center">122<p align="left"> which he cherished, took his body and laid it where it was 
		possible for them to gather together and praise God and His Christ for the 
		perfecting of the holy bishop and martyr Ignatius. For "the memory of the 
		righteous is highly praised." ' [1]<p align="left">The Acts conclude with a quotation of the 
		references made to Ignatius and Irenaeus and Polycarp.<p align="left">The work is plainly a 
		romance and cannot be shown even to be based on earlier documents.<p align="left">'The 
		exaggerated tortures inflicted on the saint, the length and character of the 
		discourses attributed to him and the strange overtures made to him by the 
		Emperor, all alike are fatal to the credit of the narrative.'[2]<p align="left">The date of 
		these Acts can only be inferred within rough limits. The writer shows traces of 
		acquaintance with, and dependence on, the <i> Ecclesiastical History</i> of Eusebius. 
		He appears also to have known the interpolated version of the Ignatian 
		Epistles, which, as we have seen, probably belongs to the latter half of the 
		fourth century.<p align="left">The story of Ignatius, as contained in these Acts, is made use 
		of by Latin martyrologists of the ninth century, not however in its original 
		form, but in combination with the narrative of the Antiochene Acts.&nbsp;
        Hence 
		Lightfoot thinks they may have been written at some period during the fifth or 
		sixth centuries.<p align="left">As to the place of writing, the fact that Greek appears to be 
		the original language of the work shows that they do not come from the Roman 
		Church, where Greek had ceased to be spoken long before this time. Lightfoot 
		adduces several indications in favour of Alexandria in Egypt as their 
		birthplace. The mention of the month Panemus (which belongs to the Alexandrian 
		reckoning), the attack made by Ignatius on animal worship, and lastly the fact 
		that these Acts alone were translated into Coptic, favours Lightfoot's 
		conclusion. The relations of Alexandria and Rome, and the prominence of Rome in 
		the narrative, may account for the circulation of these Acts in the West.
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left" style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] c. 11<br>
          [2] Lightfoot, vol. ii. p. 377.&nbsp;
        </blockquote>
        <p align="center"> 123<p align="left">The <i> Antiochene Acts</i> stand on 
		a somewhat higher level. Their genuineness has been maintained by Ussher and 
		Pearson as well as by many modern writers.&nbsp; In these Acts the centre of interest 
		is mainly Antioch, where the trial takes place, and where the reliques are 
		finally deposited.<p align="left">After describing the government of the Church at Antioch by 
		Ignatius, 'the disciple of the Apostle John, a man in every way of apostolic 
		life,' the narrative proceeds to describe the visit of Trajan to Antioch, in 
		the ninth year of his reign, after his victory over the Scythians and
        Dacians, 
		and his resolve to complete his conquests by subduing the Christians.&nbsp;
        Ignatius 
		is brought before him, and the following dialogue takes place. 'Who art thou, 
		possessed of a devil, that art so ready to disobey our commands, and to 
		persuade others also to come to a miserable death?'&nbsp; Ignatius said, 'No man 
		calleth him that carries God within him devil-possessed, for the devils keep 
		far from the servants of God. But if, because I am burdensome to these, thou 
		callest me a wretch toward devils, I agree. For because I have Christ, a 
		heavenly king, I overthrow their plots.'&nbsp; Trajan said,&nbsp; 'And who is he that 
		beareth God?'&nbsp; Ignatius answered, 'He that hath Christ in his breast.'&nbsp;
        Trajan 
		said, 'Dost thou then think that we have not gods in our hearts, forasmuch as 
		we use them as allies against our enemies?'&nbsp; Ignatius said,&nbsp; 'Thou art in error 
		in calling the devils of the nations gods. For there is one God, Who made 
		heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them, and there is one Christ 
		Jesus, His only begotten Son, Whose friendship may I enjoy.'&nbsp; Trajan said, 'Meanest thou him that was crucified under Pontius Pilate?'&nbsp;
        Ignatius said, 'I 
		mean Him that hath crucified sin and the deviser thereof, and hath condemned 
		all wickedness of devils to be trampled under foot of them that bear Him in 
		their hearts.'&nbsp; Trajan said, 'Dost thou then bear Christ within thyself?'
        Ignatius said, 'Yea, for it is written, I will dwell in them and walk in
        them.' Trajan thereupon sentences him to be taken to Rome and to be thrown to 
		the wild beasts in the amphitheatre.<p align="center">124<p align="left">The route is next 
		described. Ignatius sails from Seleucia to Smyrna, where he visits Polycarp, 
		the bishop, his fellow-student and disciple under John. The Churches of Asia 
		send their bishops, presbyters, and deacons to welcome him, and men flock to 
		him to receive a blessing from him. Then follows the letter to the Romans and 
		the account of his fears lest he should be respited.&nbsp; From Smyrna he sails to 
		Troas and Neapolis, thence through Philippi across Macedonia and Epirus to
        Epidamnus, where he takes ship to Portus. He had desired, we are told, to land 
		at Puteoli, that he might tread in the footsteps of St. Paul, but unfavourable 
		winds prevent this. Having set out from Portus, he is met by the brethren, whom 
		he addresses at length, and after having prayed to the Son of God for the peace 
		and love of the churches, he is conducted into the amphitheatre. It was the 
		great 'thirteenth day,' and the sports were drawing to a close. Only the 
		tougher parts of his reliques were left, and so his prayer was fulfilled, that 
		he might not be burdensome to any of the brethren (Rom. 4). The bones were 
		carried back to Antioch and laid in a sarcophagus as 'a priceless treasure to 
		the holy Church.'&nbsp; On the night of his martyrdom he appears to several of his 
		companions.&nbsp; To some he appears standing over them and embracing them,
        others 
		see him praying over them, others again see him 'dripping with sweat, as one 
		that had come out of great toil and standing by the Lord with great boldness 
		and unspeakable glory.'<p align="left">Like the Roman Acts, this narrative betrays its 
		spurious character. In the first place the journey by sea from Seleucia is 
		inconsistent with the genuine letters, which plainly indicate an overland 
		route, as was seen by Eusebius (<i>H. E</i>. iii. 36) and the compiler of the Roman 
		Acts (c. 1). The visit of Trajan to Antioch 'in the ninth year of his reign' 
		is unknown to history, while the expedition to Parthia, for which he is said in 
		the Acts to have been preparing, did not take place till several years later.&nbsp;
        The account of the reliques reads like the language of one writing in a later 
		age. Moreover the Acts are not quoted before the end of the sixth century. As 
		we have
		<p align="center">
 125&nbsp;
		<p align="left">
 seen, Eusebius contradicts their account of the 
		journey, nor does he mention the interview with Trajan.&nbsp; Chrysostom in his 
		oration on Ignatius nowhere alludes to the story of the Acts.&nbsp; The earliest 
		historian who shows any acquaintance with them is Evagrius, who wrote at the 
		close of the sixth century.
		<p align="left">
 There are, however, a few incidents in the latter 
		part of the journey which, it has been thought, may be based upon some true 
		traditions. Ignatius's desire to land at Puteoli, in order to follow in the 
		footsteps of St. Paul, and the disappointment of his wish, are thought by 
		Lightfoot to exhibit an 'air of truthfulness, or at least of verisimilitude.'
		<p align="left">
 So, too, the appearances of Ignatius to his friends on the night of the 
		martyrdom offer, it is urged, parallels to incidents in other genuine 
		narratives. But against the view that a contemporary letter of the saint's 
		companions has been incorporated into the narrative, Lightfoot himself urges 
		the objection that it is improbable that such a document should not have come 
		to light before the fifth or sixth century.
		
<p align="left"> We are thus thrown back upon the letters themselves for the information 
  which we seek about their author, and the traditions of later ages in this case 
  add nothing that is reliable to our knowledge.
