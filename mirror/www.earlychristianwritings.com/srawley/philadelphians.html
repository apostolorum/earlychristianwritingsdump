<P align="center">V. THE EPISTLE TO THE PHILADELPHIANS.&nbsp; 
<blockquote>
        <P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
 [Philadelphia, a city of Lydia, lay upon the great road which 
		connected Northern Phrygia and Galatia with Sardis and touched the
        AEgaean at 
		Smyrna. It does not appear to have attained any great importance, but from the 
		number of its temples and festivals it received the name of 'little Athens.' 
		This shows that it was a stronghold of the ancient religion. The first
        mention 
		of the Christian Church there is in Rev. iii. 7-13. It probably dates from the 
		stay of St. Paul at Ephesus (see Acts xix.). Already in Rev. iii. 9 the mention 
		of the Jews occupies an important place, and there are traces of Judaistic 
		error. But the Church as a whole receives high commendation (Rev. iii. 8, 10). 
		In after days the city won great renown for its long resistance to the Turks, 
		but it finally capitulated in 1390 A.D. The present city, Ala-Shehr, contains a 
		considerable Christian population under a resident Greek bishop.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignatius had 
		passed through Philadelphia (cc. 1, 6, 7) and Smyrna on his way to Troas. 
		Accordingly, whereas in writing to the Ephesians, Trallians, and
        Magnesians, he 
		warns them generally against heresy, without directly charging them with it, in 
		the present epistle he is dealing with the dangers actually existing in a 
		Church with which he is personally acquainted.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heresy which he attacks is 
		plainly Judaistic (cc. 6, 8, 9), of a strongly developed character. The false 
		teachers had organized themselves apparently into a schism (cc. 3, 7). The 
		traces of Docetism are only incidental (see inscr. and cc. 3, 8). They are not 
		sufficient to justify the view that the heresy was current at Philadelphia (see 
		Add. Note I). Nor is it necessary with Harnack (<i>Expositor</i>, March 1886, and
        <i>Chronologie</i>, pp. 389 <i>n</i>., 393 <i>n</i>.) to see in cc. 8, 9 traces of a third tendency. 
		The passages most naturally refer to the Judaistic teachers. See notes.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
		epistle was one of the three epistles written from Troas. Ignatius had been 
		joined at that place by two friends, who had followed his route and had stayed 
		at Philadelphia. There they had been welcomed by the Church as a whole, but had 
		in some way been slighted, probably by the heretical party, who also
        appear to 
		have brought false charges against Ignatius (see cc. 6, 11). These incidents 
		called forth the present letter.]
        </blockquote>
		<P> I<span style="font-variant: small-caps">GNATIUS</span>, who is also Theophorus, to the 
		Church of God the Father and Jesus Christ which is at
		<p align="center">82</p>
        Philadelphia in Asia,[1] to her who has received mercy and is 
		established in godly concord and rejoices in the passion[2] of our Lord and in 
		His resurrection without wavering, being fully persuaded in all mercy; her I 
		salute in the blood of Jesus Christ; seeing that it is eternal and enduring 
		joy, especially if they be at one with the bishop and with the presbyters who 
		are with him, and with the deacons appointed according to the mind[3] of Jesus 
		Christ; whom of His own will He established, confirming them by His Holy 
		Spirit.&nbsp;
        <p> I. For I perceived that this bishop of yours did not owe to himself or 
		to the agency of men [4] his ministry, which pertains to the common good, nor 
		does he hold it with vain glory, but in the love of God the Father and the Lord 
		Jesus Christ. For I have been amazed at his forbearance; who by his silence 
		effects more than those who speak. For he is tuned in harmony[5] with the 
		commandments as a lyre with its strings. Therefore my soul blesses his godly 
		purpose, perceiving that it is virtuous and perfect, even his unruffled and 
		quiet spirit, since he lives in all godly forbearance.[6]</p>
        <p> II. As children 
		therefore of truth flee division and false doctrines, and where the shepherd is 
		there follow as</p>

		[1]<i> i. e.</i> in the Roman province of Asia. According to local 
		divisions Philadelphia was in Lydia.
        <br>[2] Ignatius is continually dwelling on the 
		Passion of Christ. It is possible that here, as Lightfoot suggests, his 
		language is influenced by the remembrance of the Docetic denial of the Passion.
        <br>[3] The appointment of these deacons by the Church and its officers had been 
		confirmed by the gift of the Holy Spirit, conveying to them the sanction of 
		Christ Himself
        <br>[4] An echo of Gal. i. 1.
        <br>[5] The metaphor here is confused and 
		difficult. Unless the text is corrupt, and we read in the last part of the 
		sentence, 'as the strings with the lyre,' we must attribute the expression to 
		the extreme haste of composition, which this epistle exhibits also in other 
		parts.
        <br>[6] The words may also mean, 'in all forbearance inspired by a living 
		God.'</p>

        sheep. For there are many wolves[1] who by 
		specious professions lead captive with fatal pleasures the runners in God's 
		course;[2] but while you continue in unity these shall have no place.<P> III. 
		Abstain from evil herbs,[3] whose husbandman [4] is not Jesus Christ, because they 
		are not the planting of the Father.[5] I say not this because I found division 
		among you but rather sifting.[6] For as many as are of God and Jesus Christ, 
		these are with the bishop. And as many as repent and enter the unity of the 
		Church, they also shall belong to God, that they may be living according to 
		Jesus Christ. Be not deceived, my brethren. If any one follow a man that causes 
		schism, he does not inherit God's kingdom. If any man walks in strange 
		opinions, he has no part in the passion.&nbsp;<P> IV. Therefore give heed to keep one
        Eucharist.[7] For there is one flesh [8] of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup unto 
		union with His blood. There is one altar,[9] as

		John x. 12. Acts xx. 29.
		<br> [2] The favourite Pauline metaphor. Cf. Gal. v. 7, 1 Cor. ix. sq.<br> [3] Cf. Trall. 6.<br> [4] Cf. John xv.
        1, 1 Cor. iii. 9.<br> [5]
        Cf. Matt. xv. 13, and 
		see Trall. 11.<br> [6] The Philadelphians had separated themselves from these heretics. 
		Hence Ignatius will not use the word 'division,' which might imply censure, 
		but uses instead, 'sifting,' literally 'filtering.' Cf. Rom. inscr.<br> 
		[7] Cf. Smyrn.8. With the exception of the reference in the <i> Doctrine of the Twelve
        Apostles</i>, c. 9, these passages of Ignatius are the earliest certain instances 
		of the name 'Eucharist' applied to the Holy Communion. In Clement of Rome, c. 
		41, however, the verb &#949;&#965;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;, 'to give thanks,' is used of the public 
		service of the Church, and probably refers to the Eucharist. <br>[8] Cf.
        1 Cor. x. 
		16, 17, which probably suggested this language. 
		<br>[9] &#952;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;. See
        Magn. 7 (note). As we have seen, in that passage the word means probably 'the 
		court of the altar,' a sense which it plainly bears in Eph. 5 and Trall. 7. The 
		idea was suggested by the arrangements of the Jewish tabernacle and temple. 
		This may be the sense in Rev. xi. 1, as it is in Clement of Rome, c. 41. The 
		common idea underlying all these passages is 'a place of sacrifice,' or 'a 
		sanctuary.' In the present passage the 'sanctuary'

		rejoice exceedingly, I put you on your guard, yet not I, but Jesus Christ, 
		whose prisoner I am: and therefore I fear the more, since I am not yet 
		perfected. But your prayer unto God shall perfect me, that I may attain unto 
		that lot,[1] in which I have obtained mercy, because I took refuge in the Gospel 
		as the flesh [2] of Jesus, and the Apostles[3] as the presbytery of the</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">is the 
		Christian assembly gathered round the Eucharist, and forming the counterpart of 
		the congregation of Israel. There is no certain and undisputed instance of the 
		use of the word 'altar' to denote the Holy Table before Irenaeus (iv. 18. 6). 
		'The idea of the whole transaction of the Supper as a sacrifice is plainly 
		found in the <i>Didache</i> (c. 14), in Ignatius, and, above all, in Justin (l. 65 
		f.).' —Harnack {<i>Hist. of Dogma</i>, Eng. tr. I. 209). The passage from the
        <i>Didache</i> 
		(or <i> Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles</i>) urges that the celebration of the 
		Eucharist should begin with a confession of sin, 'that our sacrifice may be 
		pure.' Alike in the <i>Didache</i> and in Justin Martyr we find the prophecy
        Malachi 
		i. 11 quoted and applied to the Eucharist.&nbsp; Similarly Clement of Rome (cc. 40-44) 
		compares the bishops and deacons with the Priests and Levites of the Old 
		Testament, and mentions as the chief duty of the former 'to offer the gifts.'&nbsp;
        In addition to the prayers and thanksgivings (Smyrn. 6, Eph. 13, cf. <i>Didache</i> 
		9), the alms (cf. Polyc. <i>Phil</i>. 4), and oblations of bread and wine (cf. 
		Clement, cited <i>supra</i>), which were regarded as sacrifices, the association of 
		these with the commemoration of Christ's sacrifice and 'the gift of God' in 
		the Sacrament (Smyrn. 7, cf. Eph. 20), constituted the Christian sacrifice or 
		thankoffering (Eucharist). See Justin, <i> Trypho</i> 41, and Irenaeus, iv. 17. 5.
        <br>[1] That is, martyrdom. Cf. Trall. 12.
        <br>[2] Cf. Trall. 8, note. The outward 
		manifestations of Christ in His Incarnation is the substance of the Gospel.&nbsp;
        Zahn suggests the further thought that after the Ascension the preaching of the 
		Gospel took the place of the earthly manifestation of the Lord.
        <br>[3] The 'Gospel' 
		and the 'Apostles' plainly refer to the authorities on which Ignatius bases 
		his faith. Some have seen in the words an allusion to two distinct collections 
		of writings, <i>i. e.</i> our four Gospels and the collection of the Apostolic 
		epistles.&nbsp; From the fact that Polycarp in his one short epistle quotes nine out 
		of the thirteen</p>

        <p align="center">85</p>
        <p>Church. And the prophets 
		morever we love,[1] because they too looked forward to the Gospel in their 
		preaching, and hoped in Him and waited for Him; in Whom also they believed and 
		were saved[2] in the unity of Jesus Christ, for they were worthy of our love and 
		admiration, being holy men, testified of by Jesus Christ and enrolled together 
		in the Gospel of our common hope.</p>
        <p>VI. If any man in his interpretation[3] set 
		forth Judaism unto you, hear him not. For it is better to hear Christianity 
		from one who is circumcised than to hear Judaism from an uncircumcised
        man.[4] 
		But if both speak not of Jesus Christ, I reckon them to be tombstones and 
		graves of the dead,[5] whereon are inscribed merely names of men. Flee therefore 
		the malicious arts and snares of the prince of this world,[6] lest being worn out 
		by his suggestions you grow weak in love. But meet together, all of you, with 
		an</p>

        epistles of St. Paul we may conclude that he possessed a collection of these 
		epistles. In the time of Justin (<i>circa </i> 150 A.D.) we learn that gospels were 
		read at the Sunday Eucharist. We should be assuming, however, too much in 
		saying that in the time of Ignatius the collection of the four gospels had 
		acquired a fixed authority side by side with that of the old Testament 
		prophets, and distinct from the Apostolic epistles. The words are probably a 
		more general expression for the Gospel as publicly taught and set forth in the 
		writings, whether gospels or epistles, of the Apostles.
        <br>[1] Probably Ignatius has 
		in mind the Judaizers who set up the authority of the Old Testament books and 
		priesthood (cf. c. 9) against the Gospel. He may be replying to some charge 
		laid against the teaching of the Church as disparaging the Old Testament. For 
		his treatment of the prophets cf. Magn. 8 (notes).
        <br>[2] Cf. Magn. 9 (notes).
        <br>[3] 
		That is, the interpretation of the Old Testament and especially the prophets. 
		The allusion is to the interpretations of the Judaizers.
        <br>[4] The uncircumcised 
		man is a Gentile Christian who has a tendency to Judaistic practices. Among 
		such practices circumcision was evidently at this time not included. This 
		corresponds with what we know of the later developments of Ebionism.
        <br>[5] Cf. 
		Matt, xxiii. 27. Harnack sees in the following words a reference to Rev. iii.

        <p>VII. For even if after the 
		flesh some wished to lead me astray, yet the Spirit is not deceived since it is 
		from God. For it knoweth whence it cometh and whither it goeth,[2] and it 
		convicts the things which are in secret. I cried aloud, when I was among
        you,[3] 
		I spake with a loud voice, with the voice of God, 'Give heed unto the bishop 
		and the presbytery and deacons.'&nbsp; But they suspected[4] that I said this because I 
		knew beforehand the division caused by some;[5] yet He is my witness, Whose 
		prisoner I am, that I learned it not from human flesh. But it was the
        Spirit[6] 
		Who kept preaching in these words: 'Do nothing without the bishop. Keep your

		Christ as He also was of the Father.'</p>

        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Cf. 2 Cor. xi. 9, xii. 16, 1
        Thess. ii. 
		6. Probably Ignatius is meeting some charge made against himself in reference 
		to his conduct while at Philadelphia. The charge may refer to overbearing 
		conduct. How he came to know of such charges is explained in c. 11.
        <br>[2] In 
		addition to John iii. 8, there are parallels to the expression 'knoweth not 
		whence . . . goeth' in John viii. 14, ix. 29, xii. 35, 1 John ii. 11, and
        other 
		passages. On the affinities of thought and language between the Epistles of 
		Ignatius and the Fourth Gospel see Introd. p. 29.
        <br>[3] On the route of Ignatius, 
		see Introd. § 3.
        <br>[4] The text is in some confusion. Lightfoot's reading has been 
		adopted.
        <br>[5] The Judaistic party had plainly organized themselves into a schism. 
		Cf. c. 3.
        <br>[6] Ignatius here speaks of himself as the recipient of a spiritual 
		revelation. The gift of prophecy had not yet died out. Similarly Polycarp is 
		called 'an apostolic and prophetic teacher' {<i>Mart. Polyc</i>. 16).</p>

        <p>VIII. I therefore have done my own part as a man perfectly 
		established in union. But where there is division and wrath, God dwells not. 
		Therefore the Lord forgives all that repent, if on their repentance they turn 
		to the unity of God and the council of the bishop. I believe in the grace of 
		Jesus Christ, Who shall loose from off you every bond.[1] Moreover, I entreat 
		you, act not in any matter in the spirit of faction, but as disciples of 
		Christ. For I have heard some saying, 'Except I find it in the archives
        [2] I believe it not in the Gospel.' And when I said to them, 'It is
        written,'[3] they 
		answered me, 'That is the question in dispute.'&nbsp; But my archives[4] are Jesus 
		Christ; the inviolable</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Cf. Is. lviii. 6, which is quoted by several early 
		Christian writers. The bond refers probably, as Lightfoot says, to the power of 
		evil generally.
        <br>[2] The Greek text and the Latin version read in place of 'archives' a word which may be translated either 'ancient writings' or 'ancient 
		writers.' But as the word 'archives' occurs twice below it should probably be 
		read in this place also.&nbsp; The word originally means 'a place where records are
        kept,' and then came to be used of the documents themselves. The reference here 
		is to a collection of ancient authoritative records, <i> i. e</i>. the Old Testament, 
		which these writers set up as an authority against the Gospel, and with which 
		they required the Gospel to agree. Others, however, understand 'archives' to 
		mean the original copies of the Gospel, with which is contrasted the 
		traditional Gospel as preached and taught.&nbsp; These teachers would then be 
		represented as claiming that the Gospel had been falsified, and we should 
		translate, 'Except I find it in the archives, that is, in the (written) 
		Gospel, I do not believe it.'&nbsp; This rendering, however, gives an unjustifiable 
		sense to the word 'Gospel' and does not suit the argument of the chapter so 
		well.
        <br>[2] Ignatius claims that the points in question are found in the Old 
		Testament. The allusion is doubtless to the Cross, Death, and Resurrection of 
		Jesus Christ, which were a stumbling-block alike to Judaizers and to those who 
		held Docetic views. A similar appeal to the Old Testament had been made in the 
		first age of the Church. Cf. Luke xxiv. 26, 46; Acts xvii. 3.
        <br>[4] Ignatius, though above he has claimed that the Old Testament witnesses to Christ, here 
		maintains that the relation of Christ to the teachers of the Old Covenant is 
		not one of dependence. He is Himself the supreme authority, and His Passion and 
		Resurrection</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p> archives are His Cross and Death 
		and Resurrection, and the faith which is through Him. In these I desire to be 
		justified through your prayer.</p>
        <p>IX.. Good [l] indeed are the priests, but better 
		is the High-Priest,[2] Who has been entrusted with the Holy of Holies, for He 
		alone has been entrusted with the secret things of God. He is Himself the
        Door[3] 
		of the Father, through which enter in Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and the 
		Prophets and the Apostles and the Church. All these combine in the unity of
        God.[4]&nbsp; But the Gospel has a surpassing gift—even the coming of the Saviour, our 
		Lord Jesus Christ, His Passion, His Resurrection.&nbsp; For the Prophets, who are 
		dear to us, in their preaching looked forward to Him.&nbsp; But the Gospel is the 
		crown of incorruption. All things alike are good, if you believe by love.</p>
        <p>X. 
		Seeing that, in accordance with your prayer and the tender love which you have 
		in Christ Jesus, it has been reported to me[5] that the Church which is at&nbsp;</p>

		authenticate His mission. Cf. Magn. 8, 10 with notes. Below in c. 9 he further 
		maintains that Christ is the Door through Whom the men of the Old Covenant must 
		find entrance to God.
        <br>[1] Here, as in the previous chapter, Ignatius is making 
		concessions to the Judaizers. He grants the excellence of the Old Covenant, but 
		maintains the superiority of the Gospel, which centres in Jesus Christ.
        <br>[2] This 
		word and the passage which follows seem to show that Ignatius is reproducing 
		the ideas of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is also quoted by Clement of 
		Rome, c. 36. Cf. especially Heb. ix., x.
        <br>[3] An allusion to John x. 9. Cf. also 
		Rev. iii. 8, and Clem. Rom. 48.&nbsp; Similarly in the Shepherd of Hermas (S. ix. 4, 
		12, 15), in the building of the Church, the gate through which the stones are 
		carried is the Son of God, and among the stones built into the fabric are some 
		which represent the righteous men and prophets of old.
        <br>[4] The Old Covenant finds 
		its true place in the Divine unity of revelation, which receives its crowning 
		expression in the Incarnation.
        <br>[5] The tidings would be brought by the persons 
		mentioned in c. 11.</p>

        <p>Antioch in Syria is at 
		peace, it is fitting that you, as a Church of God, should appoint[1] a deacon to 
		journey thither as an ambassador of God, to rejoice with them when they are met 
		together, and to glorify the Name. Blessed in Jesus Christ is he who shall be 
		deemed worthy of such a ministry. You too shall be glorified. Moreover, if you 
		desire it, it is not impossible for you to do this for God's Name; even as the 
		churches which lie nearest have sent bishops, and others presbyters and 
		deacons.</p>
        <p>XI. Concerning Philo, the deacon from Cilicia, a man well reported of, 
		who even now is ministering for me in the word of God,[2] together with Rhaius
        Agathopus, an elect man, who accompanies me from Syria, having bidden farewell 
		to the ordinary life of men; who also bear witness unto you—I too thank God for 
		you, that you received them, as the Lord shall receive you. May they who 
		treated them dishonourably be ransomed by the grace of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
        The love 
		of the brethren who are at Troas salutes you, whence also I write unto you by 
		the hand of Burrhus,[3] who was sent with me by them of Ephesus and Smyrna to do 
		me honour. They shall receive honour from the Lord Jesus Christ, in Whom they 
		hope in flesh, soul, spirit, by faith, love, concord.&nbsp; Farewell in Jesus Christ, 
		our common Hope.</p>

  <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Cf. similar directions in Smyrn. II, 
    Polyc. 7. <br>
    [2] Or, as Zahn, 'ministering to me in the cause of God.' <br>
    [3] So Lightfoot. But Burrhus may have been the bearer of the epistle. See 
    note on Rom. 10.</p>
