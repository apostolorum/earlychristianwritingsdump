		<P align="center">I. THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS. 
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
		          [Ephesus was the capital of the Roman province of Asia, and was the port which 
					conducted in Roman times most of the trade of the great highway leading from 
					the East to the AEgaean. There is probably an allusion to this great 
					trade-route in Eph. 12.&nbsp; The city was naturally chosen by St. Paul as a 
					centre for missionary labours.&nbsp; See Acts xviii., xix.&nbsp; Christianity 
					spread rapidly, and Ephesus is mentioned first among the seven churches of Asia 
					in the book of Revelation (Rev. i. 11, ii. 1). A tradition dating from the last 
					quarter of the second century represents St. John as spending his later years 
					at Ephesus (see c. 11, note). Ignatius had not visited Ephesus, but the Church 
					had sent delegates to him at Smyrna. The present letter was written from Smyrna 
					to thank them for their kindly interest in him. He reminds them of their 
					glorious history (cc. 8, 11, 12), and praises them for their adherence to the 
					truth and their regard for order (c. 6). At the same time he warns them against 
					false teachers who had been passing through Ephesus (c. 9). &nbsp;He urges upon 
					them the importance, in face of heresy, of faith in the historical 
					manifestation of Jesus Christ, a more frequent use of corporate worship, and 
					adherence to the bishop. &nbsp;From the language of cc. 7, 18, 19, 20, and the 
					opening inscription (see notes), it would seem that the heresy alluded to was 
					Docetic. There are no references to Judaism.]

        <P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Probably a title adopted by Ignatius himself to remind him of his Christian 
			calling. The word may bear an active or a passive meaning, 'bearing God' or 
			'borne (or inspired) by God,' according as we read it &#952;&#949;&#959;&#966;&#959;'&#961;&#959;&#962; or &#952;&#949;&#959;'&#966;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;. 
			&nbsp;In favour of the active meaning it may be urged, (1) Ignatius in c. 9 
			uses the word in this sense. (2)&nbsp; The word was commonly interpreted in 
			this sense in the following centuries. Thus, in the Antiochene Acts of the 
			Martyrdom, c. 2, when Trajan asks, 'Who is he that beareth God?' Ignatius 
			replies, 'He that hath Christ in his breast.' (3) The idea thus contained in 
			the word was common in early writers. Cf. the early Latin reading of
        1 Cor. vi. 
			20, 'glorify <i>and bear</i>
		God in your body,' found also in Tertullian and Cyprian. From the passive 
		sense, 'borne by God' arose the tradition that Ignatius was the child whom our 
		Lord took up in His arms (Mark ix. 36).
		<br>
		[2] The word 'greatness' refers to the spiritual growth of the Church at 
		Ephesus.

		an upright and just mind] by faith and love towards Christ Jesus our Saviour. 
		Being imitators of God, you were kindled into action by the blood of God, and 
		perfectly fulfilled a task which accorded with your nature. For when you heard 
		[4] that I was come from Syria in bonds for the Name and hope common to us all, 
		and that I was hoping by your prayer to attain my purpose of fighting with wild 
		beasts at Rome, that through my attaining I may be enabled to be a disciple, 
		you were anxious to visit me.&nbsp; I received therefore your numerous body[5]

		John, the whole sum of the Divine attributes.&nbsp; Out of the Divine fulness 
		each man receives the gifts and graces needed for the spiritual life. &nbsp;The 
		word 'fulness,' as also the words 'blessed,' 'foreordained,' 'glory,' 'chosen 
		out,' 'the will [of the Father],' are perhaps reminiscences of the opening 
		verses of St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians.
		<br>
		[1] The words 'truly suffered' are an allusion to the Docetic error.
		<br>
		[2] The word 'name' is used in the sense of 'character.'
		<br>
		[3] This character was due to natural gifts rather than training or accidental 
		circumstances. The words in brackets have been added by Lightfoot from the 
		abridged Syriac version, having probably fallen out at a time earlier than any 
		existing copies of the Greek text.
		<br>
		[4] Probably at the point where Ignatius' guards took the northern route 
		through Philadelphia, instead of the southern route through Tralles, Magnesia, 
		and Ephesus, messengers were sent to inform those Churches of Ignatius'

        So then it is

					Christ.&nbsp; Ephesus was, in Ignatius' phrase, 'the highway of martyrs' (c. 
					12).&nbsp; Prisoners condemned to the wild beasts in the Roman amphitheatre, coming 
					from the East, would in most cases sail from the port of Ephesus to Ostia. 
					Ramsay (<i>Ch. in&nbsp;R. Emp</i>., p. 318) shows that the route taken by Ignatius was unusual.
				<br>
				[1] Ignatius is introducing the great theme found in all his epistles, the 
				importance of unity. Christ is at one with the Father; the bishops, however 
				distant from each other, are at one with Jesus Christ. &nbsp;In the phrase 
				'furthest quarters,' Ignatius would be contemplating regions as distant as Gaul 
				on the one hand and Mesopotamia on the other' (Lightfoot).

		<P>gratulate you, who are knit to him as closely as is the Church to Jesus Christ 
			and Jesus Christ to the Father, that all things may accord in unity. Let no man 
			be deceived. If any one be not within the enclosure of the altar,[1] he lacks 
			the bread of God.[2] &nbsp;For if the prayer of one or two hath so great 
			efficacy,[3] how much more has the prayer of the bishop and of the whole 
			Church.&nbsp; So then he who comes not to the congregation thereby shows his 
			pride and straightway cuts himself off. For it is written, <i>'God resisteth the 
				proud</i>.'[4] &nbsp;So then let us take heed not to resist the bishop, that we may be 
		living in submission to God.[5]
		<P>
		VI. And so far as a man sees a bishop keeping silence,[6] let him hold him all 
		the more in reverence. For every one, whom the Master of the household sends to 
		administer His own household, we ought to receive even as the Sender's very 
		self. The bishop then we ought plainly to regard as the Lord 
		Himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Onesimus of his own accord praises highly your orderly 
		manner of life in God, how that you all live in accordance with truth and that 
		in your midst no heresy has its dwelling.&nbsp; Nay, you do not even listen to 
		any one if he speak of aught beyond[7] Jesus Christ in truth.

				[1] On the word translated 'enclosure of the altar,' see Trall. 7, Philad. 4, 
				with notes. The 'enclosure of the altar' is the court of the congregation in 
				the old Tabernacle or Temple. This was separated from the outer court. Here it 
				denotes the assembly of the faithful in each individual church.

				sense, 'we may be God's by our subjection.'

				[1] Cf. Smyrn. 4, Philad. 2.
				<br>
				[2] On the antithesis of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in these epistles, see 
				Introd. § 4. The word 'spirit' expresses here the Divine nature of 
				Christ.&nbsp; We may compare 2 Clem. c. 9, ' Christ the Lord . . . being first 
				spirit, then became flesh.'&nbsp; The human element is expressed by the word 
				'flesh.'&nbsp; For this balanced antithesis, cf. Polyc. 3.&nbsp;
				<br>
					[3]&nbsp;The terms employed by Ignatius are &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; and &#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;.&nbsp;
                    Ignatius is using the words to express little more than 'created and 
					uncreate.'&nbsp; Such language, however, points to an early period of doctrinal 
					statement, and could not have been used in later days without incurring the 
					charge of heresy, as it would have seemed to deny the Divine generation of the 
					Son. 'The conception of a Divine Sonship was realized by the Church before the 
					conception of a Divine generation' (Swete, <i>Apostles' Creed</i>, p. 28). 
					Hence the use of such language by Ignatius at a time when there was no exact 
					definition of theological terms involves nothing inconsistent with the Nicene 
					Creed, and affords no proof that he denied the pre-existence of Christ. This 
					latter finds expression in Magn. 6 and Polyc. 3. See further Lightfoot's <i>Excursus</i>
				, vol. ii. pp. 90, foll.
				<br>
				[4] The whole of this passage is aimed at the Docetic error, which denied the 
				reality of the Incarnation.
				<br>
					[5] Literally, 'I am your offscouring.'  The same word, &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#968;&#951;&#956;&#945;, is 
					used by St. Paul in 1 Cor. iv. 13. It is a word used of condemned criminals of 
					the lowest classes, who were sacrificed as expiatory offerings in times of 
					plague or other visitations, to avert the wrath of the Gods.&nbsp;
                    It thus includes 
					the two ideas of 'self-devotion' and 'abasement.'</P>

				[2]&nbsp;See Introd. § 4.&nbsp;
				<br>
				[3]&nbsp;It is uncertain what place is alluded to. Lightfoot conjectures 
				Philadelphia.
				<br>
				[4] The change of metaphor is sudden, after the manner of Ignatius, and is 
				followed by another change. They are in succession the soil in which seed is 
				sown, stones of a building, and members of a festal procession.
				<br>
				[5] Lightfoot's emendation has been adopted.
				<br>
				[6] The whole of this passage is a somewhat extravagant expansion in great 
				detail of the metaphor used by St. Paul in Eph. ii. 20 sq. In the building of 
				the Church, the faithful are the stones, the Cross is the crane, the Holy 
				Spirit is the rope by which the stones are raised, faith is the windlass which 
				sets the machine in motion, and love is the inclined plane along which the 
				stones are drawn.
				<br>[7] Another change of metaphor. The figure is now a heathen procession, in which 
					the pilgrims, arrayed in festal attire, carry small shrines, images, and other 
					sacred emblems.&nbsp; Such processions would be common in Syria, Asia, and 
					elsewhere. &nbsp;For a gift of such images to the temple of Artemis at Ephesus,

		prayers; where they are in error, be steadfast in the faith[4]; in face of 
		their fury be gentle. Be not eager to retaliate upon them. Let our forbearance 
		prove us their brethren. Let us endeavour to be imitators of the Lord, striving

			this or that; only be it ours to be found in Christ Jesus unto life which is 
			life indeed. Apart from Him, let nothing dazzle you.&nbsp; For in Him I wear my

				<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">the relation here conceived of between Christ and the Church is that of the Head 
					to the Body. The Body partakes of the fragrant ointment which has been poured 
					'upon the Head.'&nbsp; This interpretation, which is suggested by Von der Goltz 
					(<i>Texte u. Unters</i>. xii. 3), accords with the interpretation of the 
					incident given by Origen, <i>c. Cels</i>
				. vi. 79.
				<br>
				[1] 'The prince of this world' recalls the similar phrase in St. John (xii. 31, 
				xiv. 30, xvi. 11). The words for 'world,' however, are different. In 
				Ignatius &#945;&#953;&#969;&#957; is found, in the Gospel &#954;&#959;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; is used.&nbsp; The

				<br>
				[2]&nbsp;Lit. 'my spirit is the oflscouring of the Cross.'&nbsp; See note on c. 
				8.

				Cf. Eph. i. 10.
				<br>[5]&nbsp;The thought of Ignatius appears to be that by His own baptism our Lord 
					set apart and appropriated water to the use of His Church in the future for the 
					Sacrament of Baptism.&nbsp; The <i>virtue</i> of baptism, however, was 
					derived from the cleansing power of the Cross communicated in the

				<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] The idea that Satan was deceived by the mysterious silence and reserve of 
					God in the Incarnation is found in writers of the second, third, and fourth 
					centuries.&nbsp; Thus Gregory of Nyssa (<i>Or. Cat</i>. 26) says: 'He who first deceived man by the bait of sensual pleasure, is 
				himself deceived by the presentment of the human form.'&nbsp;
				<br>[2]&nbsp;One of the two MSS. of the Curetonian Syriac Version omits all mention 
					of the death, and dissociates 'the three mysteries' from what precedes. The 
					words then run: 'the virginity of M. and the birth of our Lord and the three 
					mysteries of a cry.'&nbsp; But it is difficult to see what 'the three 
					mysteries' can mean, when thus dissociated from the preceding words. &nbsp;The 
					absence of the omitted clause in the quotation of this passage by Origen (<i>Hom, 
						in Luc</i>. vi.) is explained by the fact that he is quoting the passage merely with 
				reference to the Virgin-Birth.
				<br>
				[3]&nbsp;By 'the death of the Lord' here Ignatius means the atonement brought 
				about through the death.&nbsp; The fact was known to Satan; its significance 
				escaped him. Cf.&nbsp;1 Cor. ii. 7 sq.
				<br>[4]&nbsp;A later expansion, doubtless, of the incident described in Matt. 
					ii.&nbsp;1 sq., but whether derived from oral tradition or a written source we 
					cannot tell.&nbsp; The only other passage where Ignatius shows knowledge of a 
					tradition other than that preserved in our Gospels is in Smyrn. 3.&nbsp; In 
					Clement of Alexandria, <i>Exc. Theod</i>
				. 74, the incident of the star is expanded in language which may show 
				acquaintance with this passage of Ignatius.
				<br>[5]&nbsp;The idea appears to have been suggested by Joseph's dream. For similar 
					legendary additions, see passages quoted by Lightfoot, vol. ii. pp. 81, 82. How 
					far this passage is intended as an actual description it is difficult to say.</P>

				[1] Magic and witchcraft were widely prevalent in the Empire throughout the
