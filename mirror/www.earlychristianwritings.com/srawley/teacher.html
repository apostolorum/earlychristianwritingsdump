<P align="center">4. ST. IGNATIUS AS A TEACHER. 
<P>THE splendid example of the Christian martyr-spirit was not the only legacy of 
			Ignatius to the Church. In the epistles which have come down to us he has 
			presented to us the picture of a lofty, spiritual character, <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		<P>
		and has bequeathed to us a body of teaching, which has given him a foremost 
		place among the 'Apostolic Fathers.'
		<P>
		The doctrinal and controversial interest of his writings must not be allowed to 
		obscure the profoundly spiritual character which lies behind them. &nbsp;The 
		letters abound in maxims and in passages of great spiritual beauty. &nbsp;They 
		present to us a man, who has a keen insight into the practical significance of 
		the Incarnation and the fresh, spiritual value which it has given to material 
		things.&nbsp; He can say even of the simple events of daily life, 'Those things 
		which you do after the flesh are spiritual, for you do all things in Jesus 
		Christ.'[l] &nbsp;Though he is the uncompromising champion of Church order and 
		the ministry, we find him saying, 'Let not office puff up any man, for faith 
		and love are all in all.'[2] Amid all his insistence upon outward unity, he 
		does not forget to remind us that the inner principle of union is God 
		Himself.[3] So again, he loves to dwell on the 'silence' of God's working.[4] 
		&nbsp;To Ignatius, Christ and His Cross are all in all. In the Passion of Jesus 
		Christ lies the power which draws his heart from all earthly longings.[5] 
		&nbsp;Hence his one aspiration, expressed again and again, is 'that I may 
		attain unto God.'&nbsp; And yet throughout there breathes a deep spirit of 
		humility. He is 'one born out of due time,'[6] &nbsp;'the last (of all).'[7] 
		Though at the close of a long career, he writes, ' Now I am beginning to be a 
		disciple.'[8]
		<P>His teaching reflects the natural character and circumstances of its author. 
			Thus the deep vein of mysticism which pervades these letters may be partly due 
			to the intense and fervid Oriental character of the writer. Again, the 
			influences of heathen training show themselves to some degree in the form in 
			which he apprehended Christianity. The idea of union with God, and the 
			conception of redemption as deliverance from death

		and the power of demons, present points of contact with the religious ideas of 
		the heathen world, as we know it in the first and second centuries, and are 
		such as would naturally attract a convert from heathenism. And further, if we 
		could trust the later tradition, which is not impossible so far as dates are 
		concerned (though worthless in itself), that St. John was the teacher of 
		Ignatius, we should find a natural explanation of the close relationship 
		between his thought and that of the Johannine writings.
		<P>As compared with later teaching, the theology of Ignatius, like that of the 
			other 'Apostolic Fathers,' exhibits in some respects an immature and 
			undeveloped character. It was only slowly that men came to sound the depths of 
			the teaching of St. Paul and St. John, and to grasp the eternal relations of 
			the truths revealed in time. Hence we find in Ignatius a use of doctrinal 
			terms, which would have been avoided by the more exact theology of a later age. 
			Instances are the phrases,&nbsp;'the blood of God,'[l] &nbsp;'the passion of my 
			God,'[2] and the word 'unoriginate,'[3] which, as applied to our Lord, might 
			seem to deny the Eternal Generation. &nbsp;There is also an absence of any 
			references to the work of the Son of God in the world before the Incarnation 
			(except, perhaps, in Magn. 8), and of the doctrine of His agency in Creation 
			such as we find in St. Paul. While Ignatius applies to Him the title 'Logos' 
			or 'Word,'&nbsp;[4] and elsewhere speaks of Him as 'the Mind of the Father,'[5] 
			and 'the unerring Mouth whereby the Father spake;' [6] while, moreover, he 
			asserts the Divine Sonship, and once uses the phrase, 'the Only Son,'[7] yet he 
			nowhere speaks of the eternal relations of this Divine Sonship to the 
			Fatherhood of God, beyond the mere fact of the Son's pre-existence with the 
			Father.[8] How far the human nature was complete, whether Christ had a human 
			soul, how the two natures are united in One Person, these are questions which 
			lie outside the scope <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		<P>&nbsp;and grasp of the teaching of Ignatius. Nor again do the epistles present 
			us with a theology of the Cross, or attempt to sound the depths of St. Paul's 
			teaching upon the Death of Christ. &nbsp;The idea of 'justification' is found 
			only in two passages, <i>i.e.</i>
		Rom. 5 and Philad. 8, and only in the latter of these is it used in connection 
		with the Passion.&nbsp; The word 'propitiation' does not occur, and there is 
		only one mention of 'forgiveness' in connection with repentance, in Philad. 8. 
		It is not maintained that Ignatius ignored the teaching associated with such 
		language. His repeated references to the Cross and Passion imply the contrary. 
		But his particular contribution to Christian thought and teaching lay in 
		another direction, and he was content accordingly to repeat, without 
		developing, the simple language of his time upon the Death of Christ.
		<P>
		Such are some of the limits within which the teaching of these epistles moves. 
		But when we come to their positive contents, we find that they witness to a 
		Church tradition which is singularly full and varied, and, above all, they 
		present a view of the Person of Jesus Christ, which is richer and more complete 
		than anything to be found in the writings of the other 'Apostolic Fathers.'
		<P>With regard to the former of these, the witness of the epistles to the Church 
			tradition of their time, we may quote the language of Dr. Harnack (<i>Chronologie</i>
		, p. xi). Speaking of the epistles of St. Clement and St. Ignatius, he says: 
		'He who diligently studies these letters cannot fail to perceive what a fulness 
		of traditions, subjects of preaching, doctrines, and forms of organization 
		already existed in the time of Trajan, and in individual churches had attained 
		a secure position.' Among the contents of this Church tradition, we may notice 
		the reference to the Threefold Name in Magn. 13 (cf. Eph. 9, Philad. inscr.). 
		When we come to the historical facts of the Lord's earthly life, we find, first 
		of all, a clear and emphatic witness to the Virgin-birth. 'The virginity of 
		Mary and her child-bearing' formed two of the 'three mysteries,' 'wrought in 
		the silence of God,' but now 'to be
		<P align="center">
		28
		<P>
		proclaimed aloud.'[1]&nbsp; Against the Docetic heretics he is never weary of 
		emphasizing, in language that presents the appearance of being derived either 
		from liturgical formulae or short creed-like statements,[2] the Virgin-birth, 
		the Davidic descent, the baptism by John, the crucifixion under Pontius Pilate 
		and Herod the tetrarch, and the resurrection. See esp. the two passages, Trall. 
		9, Smyrn. 1, 2. &nbsp;He mentions the star seen at the birth of Jesus 
		Christ,[3] and dwells upon the intercourse of the Lord, after His Resurrection, 
		with the Apostles.[4] &nbsp;Of interest too is the reference to the descent 
		into Hades in Magn. 9 (cf. Philad. 5, 9).&nbsp; He nowhere speaks of the actual 
		fact of the Ascension, although it is presupposed in Magn. 7. But, for the 
		purposes which he had in hand, it did not possess the same immediate interest 
		as the facts of the Birth, Passion, and Resurrection, which witness to the 
		reality of the Lord's human nature. The references to the Second Coming of the 
		Lord are very slight. See Eph. 15, and compare the expression in Rom. 10, 
		'patient abiding for Jesus Christ.'&nbsp; Ignatius speaks of the Holy Spirit in 
		language which plainly shows that he regarded Him as distinct from the Father 
		and the Son. Cf. Magn. 13.&nbsp; He speaks of Him as 'from God,'[5] and regards 
		the miraculous conception of Jesus Christ as wrought, through His agency.[6] 
		&nbsp;Elsewhere he dwells upon His work of sanctification in the Church.&nbsp; 
		See especially the striking passage in Eph. 9, and cf. Philad. inscr., Magn. 
		13.&nbsp; In Philad. 7, Ignatius claims to have received personal revelations 
		from the Spirit.
		<P>
		In two passages Ignatius refers to ordinances of the Apostles. In Magn. 13 the 
		readers are bidden to stand fast 'in the ordinances of the Lord and the 
		Apostles.'&nbsp; In Trall. 7 they are urged to be 'inseparable from Jesus 
		Christ and the bishop, and the ordinances of the Apostles.'
		<P>When we come to examine the relation of these letters to the Canon of Scripture, 
			we find very strong traces of <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		<P>the influence of the thoughts and ideas preserved for us in the books of the New 
			Testament, but comparatively few traces of actual quotation from any of the 
			writers of the New Testament. The cast of thought shows strong affinities with 
			the ideas of the Johannine writings and the later epistles of St. Paul, 
			especially St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians.&nbsp; But it is difficult to 
			prove that Ignatius is in any passage quoting from the Fourth Gospel.&nbsp; The 
			contrasts between life and death, God and the prince of this world, and the 
			emphasis on knowledge and faith, truth and love, move in the same circles of 
			ideas as the Fourth Gospel.&nbsp; Again, the reference to Christ as 'the Door' 
			(Philad. 9), the phrases 'the bread of God,' 'living water' (Rom. 7), lastly 
			the words in Philad. 7, 'the Spirit is from God. For it knoweth whence it 
			cometh and whither it goeth,' present striking parallels to the language of the 
			Gospel, and suggest that either Ignatius was familiar with the Gospel, or that 
			he had lived in surroundings where the ideas and teaching represented in our 
			present Gospel were current. Lastly, there is the possibility already referred 
			to above (p. 26), that Ignatius had been a disciple of St. John. For the 
			suggested parallel with John xii. 3 found in Eph. 17, see note on that passage. 
			The allusions of Ignatius to the actions and words of the Lord exhibit a 
			tradition most closely akin to that found in St. Matthew's Gospel, with which 
			these epistles exhibit more numerous parallels than with any other N. T. 
			writing. In no passage does he allude definitely to written gospels, though 
			Philad. 5 seems to point to a collection of apostolic writings. In one instance 
			[1] he quotes from an apocryphal source, whether written or traditional we 
			cannot tell. For the passage Eph. 19, see notes. With the epistles of St. Paul 
			there are many parallels pointing to the author's acquaintance with them, 
			though without actual quotation. In Eph. 12 the author directly speaks of St. 
			Paul and his epistles. For further parallels with books of the New Testament, 
			see Index of Scriptural passages. We may say in con- <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		clusion that the epistles point to a period in which the New Testament 
		writings, though current, had not superseded the oral tradition of the Church, 
		as an authority and standard of teaching.
		<P>
		For his attitude towards the Old Testament, see Magn. 8—10, Philad. 5, 8, 9, 
		with notes.
		<P>Ignatius' conception of the Christian faith is more striking than that of any 
			sub-apostolic writer. He starts not from Creation or. the Old Testament but 
			from the revelation of God in Christ. In Christ's appearing God has revealed 
			Himself in man, the Eternal in time, the Spiritual in the material.[1] 
			&nbsp;The antithesis of 'spirit' and 'flesh,' which is conceived of as 
			reconciled in Christ, runs through the whole theology of Ignatius.[2]&nbsp;
        The whole 
			earthly life of Christ has a place in the mystery of redemption, which has a 
			significance for the whole Creation.[3] Thus he speaks of 'the virginity of 
			Mary, and her child-bearing, likewise also the death of the Lord,' as 'three 
			mysteries to be proclaimed aloud.'[4]&nbsp; It is the Person and not merely the 
			teaching of Christ, which is of importance. He is 'our God,' 'my God,' 'God in 
			man,' though never apparently called God absolutely without some defining 
			words.[5]&nbsp; The controversial purpose of the letters leads Ignatius to lay 
			special stress upon the reality of the human nature of Christ. The Docetae, 
			whom he is attacking, conceived of the existence of Christ in a purely 
			metaphysical way, as a spiritual or ideal existence. Against this view Ignatius 
			sets the historical Christ, whose appearing in human form becomes the medium of 
			God's revelation and alone guarantees its truth to man.&nbsp; Hence he 
			emphasizes the facts of His earthly life.&nbsp; The Coming of the Saviour, His 
			Passion and His Resurrection are the three points which distinguish the Gospel 
			from all earlier teaching.[6]&nbsp; Through the Cross, Death, and Resurrection

		he seeks to be justified.[1] &nbsp;Especially prominent is the place which he 
		assigns to the Passion. In the inscriptions to two letters (Philad., Trall.) he 
		speaks of the Churches addressed, as 'rejoicing in the Passion' and 'at peace 
		in flesh and spirit through the Passion of Jesus Christ.'[2] &nbsp;The Blood of 
		Christ reveals God's love.[3] &nbsp;In Smyrn. 6 he speaks of Christ as 
		suffering 'for our sins,' and in Eph. 18 he associates Baptism with the 
		cleansing power of the Passion.[4] &nbsp;In addition to these incidental 
		allusions, he shows acquaintance in one passage[5] with the ideas represented 
		in the Epistle to the Hebrews.&nbsp; Christ is 'the High Priest, Who has been 
		entrusted with the Holy of Holies,' but Ignatius immediately connects this 
		thought with that of Christ as the 'Door' of the Father, a conception which we 
		find in John x. 9.&nbsp; In Philad. 8, 11, he speaks of being delivered from 
		'every bond,' and being 'ransomed' by the grace of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;In these 
		respects he echoes the traditional language of his time. The ideas, however, 
		which chiefly occupy his thoughts are that the Death and Resurrection of Christ 
		have annihilated death, have freed man from the power of evil,[6] and have 
		given him the assurance of eternal life through union with God in Christ. 
		Christ, 'our life,'[7] has passed through death, and life is assured to those 
		who believe in Him and are united with Him. Hence Christians are 'branches of 
		the Cross.' [8] &nbsp;Thus his teaching presents points of contact with St. 
		John, and with the later, rather than the earlier, teaching of St. Paul. 
		&nbsp;St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians exhibits the nearest point of contact 
		between Ignatius and St. Paul.&nbsp; In this connection notice especially the 
		language of Eph. 19, 20 upon 'the new man,' and of Trall.&nbsp;11 upon 'the one 
		Body.'

			union of God and man in Christ is realized practically by Christians in the 
			life of faith <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		and love.[1] But it finds its fullest expression in the unity of the Church, 
		which represents Christ and shares His life and twofold nature.[2]&nbsp;
        Hence the 
		unity of the Church is at once 'of flesh' and 'of spirit.'[3]&nbsp; The insistence of 
		Ignatius upon the visible unity of the Church is not adequately explained by 
		the pressure of heresy.&nbsp; That he was led to give special emphasis to it by the 
		dangers of his time is undoubtedly true. But it is plainly a consequence of his 
		belief in the principle of the Incarnation, the reconciliation of the outward 
		and the inward, of 'spirit' and 'flesh,' of 'God' and 'man'&nbsp; &nbsp;The 
		Catholic Church is the Body of Christ, and secures the perpetual communication 
		of the One Life of Christ.[4] &nbsp;To impair the unity of the Church by false 
		teaching and separatism is to cut oneself off from the Passion and the 
		sacramental life of the Church.[5]
		<P>
		The individual churches represent locally the universal Church. As Jesus Christ 
		is the Head of the universal Church, so is the bishop the head of the local 
		Church.[6] He is God's representative,[7] as being the chief member of the 
		local representation of that Church which is the Body of Christ. Hence the 
		bishops are spoken of as being 'in the mind of Jesus Christ.'[8]&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
		represent, and carry on that reconciliation of 'flesh' and 'spirit,' which is 
		assured through the Incarnation. Thus Ignatius writes to Polycarp: 'Therefore 
		you are of flesh and spirit, that you may humour the things which are visibly 
		present before your face.'[9] The ministry in the Ignatian epistles shows a 
		more developed character than that described in the books of the New Testament 
		and the writings of the sub-apostolic age. In the New Testament we find that 
		the administration of the local churches was in the hands of a body of 
		officials who are some-

		<P>times spoken of as presbyters and sometimes as 'bishops' (<i>episcopi</i>).[1]&nbsp;
        We find a similar use of terms when we pass beyond the New Testament. The local 
			ministry consists of 'bishops and deacons' (Didache), or 'presbyters and 
			deacons' (Polycarp, <i>ad Philipp</i>. 5, 6), while Clement of Rome sometimes 
			speaks of 'presbyters' and sometimes of 'bishops,' when he is referring 
			apparently to the same office.&nbsp; But in no case do we read of a single 
			'bishop' as the resident head of a local community.&nbsp; On the other hand, in the 
			position of St. James at Jerusalem (Acts xii. 17, xv. 2, xxi.18) we have what 
			appears to be an anticipation of the functions (though the name does not 
			appear) of the 'bishop' of the Ignatian epistles, seeing that St. James is 
			represented as head or president of a body of presbyters who control the local 
			affairs of the Church and through whom all communications with the Church take 
			place.&nbsp; This position, however, appears to have been peculiar to 
			Jerusalem.&nbsp; Elsewhere the Apostles appear to have exercised a general 
			superintendence over the churches which they had founded, and in the Pastoral 
			Epistles we find Timothy and Titus receiving a commission (probably temporary) 
			from St. Paul to act as 'apostolic delegates' and to ordain clergy and 
			administer discipline in the churches of Ephesus and Crete.&nbsp; In the 
			Didache we hear also of itinerant apostles, prophets, and teachers, who visit 
			the local church, and directions are given that, if a prophet wishes to settle 
			among them, he is to be accorded a position of pre-eminence. At the same time 
			injunctions are given that 'bishops and deacons' are to be held in honour 'for 
			they also minister to you the ministry of prophets and teachers.'&nbsp;
        In this 
			picture we see a survival of the honour and esteem in which the special gifts 
			of missionary apostles and Christian prophets were held, and a disposition to 
			rank on a lower level the local ministry of office.[2]&nbsp; But as the Apostles and 
			early missionaries <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		passed away, and the gift of prophecy became rare,[1] the local ministry 
		absorbed many of the permanent functions exercised by these earlier ministries. 
		These new conditions are reflected in the Ignatian epistles.
		<P>
		(i) There is no trace of the itinerant ministry of apostles and prophets which 
		we find in the Didache, and we read only of the local threefold ministry of 
		bishops, priests, and deacons.
		<P>(ii) At the head of each church there is a single bishop, who is superior to the 
			presbyters, though closely associated with them. The bishop alone can give the 
			requisite authority for the performance of ministerial acts.[2]&nbsp; The 
			monarchical character of his office is clearly shown by the comparison of the 
			bishop to 'the Father' or 'Jesus Christ,' while the presbyters represent the 
			Apostles. On this comparison see <i>antea</i>, p. 19.
		<P>
		(iii) The bishop's office is localized and he is permanently attached to the 
		local church.&nbsp; Ignatius mentions the bishops of the cities of Ephesus, 
		Magnesia, Tralles, Philadelphia and Smyrna.&nbsp; Of a diocese, in the later 
		sense of the word, there is no trace,[3] and the bishop's authority is not, 
		like that of the Apostles, of a general, undefined character, but is limited to 
		a particular church.
		<P>
		Thus in the Ignatian Epistles we find the three orders of&nbsp;bishops, 
		priests, and deacons. The bishop's office appears for the first time under the 
		name by which it has since been known in history, although, as we have seen, 
		there is something like an anticipation of the position occupied by him in the 
		presidency of St. James in the Church of Jerusalem.
		<P>There are a few other facts which may be noticed about the ministry in the 
			Ignatian Epistles. <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		1. Closely associated with the bishops, and forming a 'spiritual coronal' about 
		him, are the presbyters, and with them the deacons. The bishop's authority, 
		though monarchical, 'is very far from being autocratic.'[1] &nbsp;In his 
		administration the presbyters form a 'council'[2] around him as 'the strings 
		to a harp.'[3] &nbsp;The writer is scarcely less emphatic in asserting the duty 
		of obedience to the presbyters than he is to the bishop. If the bishop 
		represents the Lord, the presbyters represent the Apostles.[4] &nbsp;Ignatius 
		bids his readers be subject to the bishop 'as unto the grace of God,' and to 
		the presbytery 'as unto the law of Jesus Christ.'[5] &nbsp;
		<P>
		Similarly he bids his readers obey the deacons. The three orders together form 
		a central authority, so that 'without these there is no church deserving the 
		name.' [6]
		<P>
		2. Ignatius tells us little of the source of the bishop's authority or of the 
		way in which such authority was delegated to him.&nbsp; He speaks of the 
		bishops as representing the authority of Christ, though never as succeeding to 
		the Apostles. &nbsp;On the other hand, he compares the presbyters to the 
		Apostles, though he is thinking of the Apostles in their relation to Christ 
		during His ministry and not as they were after the Ascension, when they 
		themselves became the representatives of Christ.[7] &nbsp;The only passage in 
		which it has been suggested that Ignatius claims apostolic authority for the 
		bishop's office is Trall. 7, where he urges them to be 'inseparable from Jesus 
		Christ and the bishop and the ordinances of the Apostles.'&nbsp;&nbsp; In this 
		last phrase Lightfoot sees a reference to the institution of episcopacy (see 
		note on the passage). Similarly in Trall. 12&nbsp; Ignatius bids them 
		'severally, and especially the presbyters, refresh the bishop to the honour of 
		the Father and of Jesus Christ and of the Apostles.'
		<P>
		3. The language of the epistles does not support the view of Ramsay and others, 
		that episcopacy is insisted
        <blockquote>
		<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Lightfoot, 1, p. 397.

		<P>on so strongly in these letters because Ignatius recognized it as a new and 
			valuable institution, which he desired to see established everywhere.[1]&nbsp; 
			From other sources, indeed, it would seem that a representative of the 
			episcopal order was not established in every city church at this time, as in 
			the case of Philippi, in writing to which Church Polycarp only makes mention of 
			their presbyters and deacons.[2]&nbsp; But when we study the Ignatian epistles 
			themselves, we see no trace of an idea that the episcopal office is of recent 
			introduction. The writer speaks of the 'bishops established in the furthest 
			quarters.'[3] &nbsp;Without the three orders of bishops, presbyters, and 
			deacons 'there is no church deserving the name.'[4] &nbsp;Nor can we draw any 
			argument from the absence of any mention of the bishop in the Epistle to the 
			Romans. That epistle is of a purely personal character, and it is written with 
			reference to the action of certain members of the Church of Rome, who were 
			anxious to procure a respite for Ignatius.&nbsp; He nowhere salutes or makes 
			mention of any of the officers of the Church in that city, whether bishop, 
			presbyters, or deacons. Hence no argument can fairly be drawn from the absence 
			of all mention of the ministry in the Roman Church, in favour of the idea that 
			the Church at Rome did not possess a representative of one of the three orders, <i>
				i.e</i>. a bishop.
		<P>The repeated insistence by Ignatius on the duty of obedience to this threefold 
			ministry was occasioned by the danger arising in his day from the heretical and 
			separatist tendencies of the Docetic and Judaic parties. But it has its roots 
			in that idea of the Church and its unity which we have already described. The 
			same principle, the union of&nbsp; 'flesh' and 'spirit,' of outward and inward, 
			appears in his language upon the Eucharist in Philad. 4, Smyrn. 6, 
			8.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, he uses clear and definite language as to the 
			nature of the gift received in the sacrament.&nbsp; The Eucharist is 'the flesh 
			of Christ,' 'the gift of God,' 'the medicine of immor- <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

		tality'; the 'one cup' brings us into 'union with the Blood' of Christ.&nbsp; 
		On the other hand, there is a strong vein of mysticism in his teaching, which 
		leads him to speak of&nbsp; 'faith' as the 'flesh' of Christ, and 'love' as 
		'the blood' of Christ (Trall. 8, Rom. 7). The dangers of the time led Ignatius 
		to an emphatic warning to his readers to guard the sacramental unity of the 
		Church, which was broken by the separatists. They are to assemble at the 'one 
		altar.'[1] &nbsp;Without the bishop's authority they are not 'to baptize or 
		hold a love-feast.'&nbsp; His authority alone gives 'validity' and 'security' 
		to whatever is done.' [2]
		<P>
		For his language on baptism, see Eph. 18, Smyrn. 8, Polyc. 6.
		<P>
		The teaching of Ignatius upon the Incarnation, as a fact and as a principle, 
		has its roots in the teaching of St. Paul and St. John, and was taken up by 
		later Fathers. At the close of the second century it finds expression in St. 
		Irenaeus. Once more, amid the perils arising from Arianism, St. Athanasius, in 
		the fourth century, seized upon its leading idea, that in Jesus Christ God 
		Himself has entered our human nature, in order to reveal Himself to man and 
		endow man with the gift of eternal life. &nbsp;In that faith has lain the 
		secret of&nbsp; 'the victory that overcometh the world.'
		<P>Once again, when Ignatius asserted that in the Incarnation was effected the 
			reconciliation of 'flesh' and 'spirit,' of the material and the spiritual, he 
			stated a principle that has found expression in the life and worship of the 
			Catholic Church. Gnosticism and later mysticism alike have emphasized the 
			opposition between spirit and matter, and have tended to despiritualize the 
			material.&nbsp; In the Middle Ages men were inclined to confuse the two, and so 
			to materialize the spiritual.&nbsp; In her unchanging faith and the permanent 
			elements of her life and worship, the Church witnesses to the truer view, and 
			reconciles the antithesis. In 'the Word made flesh' we see the promise of the 
			consummation of all things.
