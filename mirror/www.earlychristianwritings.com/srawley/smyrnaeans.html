 VI. THE EPISTLE TO 
		THE SMYRNAEANS.
        <blockquote>

		<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
 [Smyrna was one of the oldest of the Greek cities on the west 
		coast of Asia. During the first and second centuries <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> A.
 D</span>. it vied with Ephesus 
		and Pergamos in claiming the title 'first city of Asia.'&nbsp; Of the foundation of 
		the Church at Smyrna we have no record in the New Testament, but it may 
		possibly be placed at some period during St. Paul's three years' residence at 
		Ephesus, as it was within easy reach of that city and was a great centre of 
		trade. We have a picture of the Church in this city in Rev. ii. 8-11. That 
		passage contains an allusion to persecution (ii. 10), and also to the hostility 
		and calumnies of the Jews (ii. 9). Ignatius had stayed at Smyrna and had 
		received a warm welcome from the Church and its bishop Polycarp. The number of 
		salutations would point to his having made many friends there. The present 
		letter was written from Troas. The rapid transition, immediately after the 
		opening salutation, to the subject of the Docetic heresy (cc. 1-7) seems to 
		show that the Church at Smyrna had been endangered by its presence. Moreover in 
		c. 7 Ignatius warns his readers against associating with these heretics. The 
		epistle contains the most detailed account of Docetism to be found in the 
		Ignatian writings. From c. 6 we learn that these heretics had neglected the 
		practical duties of Christianity. From cc. 7, 8 it appears that they had formed 
		into separatist communities (see notes). Hence the heresy is probably of a more 
		developed character than that referred to in the epistles to the Ephesians and
        Trallians. There are, however, no allusions to Judaism unless we except cc. 
		5, 7.&nbsp; The opening words of c. 1 indicate that as yet the Church had remained 
		steadfast. In cc. 7, 8 there is a strong statement of the unity of the Church. 
		Of special interest is the occurrence for the first time in Christian 
		literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church.']&nbsp;

 allusion to the heathen ceremonial. 'The 
		"sacred vessels" which the Church of Smyrna bears are its Christian graces and 
		virtues.' —L<span style="font-variant: small-caps">IGHTFOOT</span>.<br>
 [1] The Armenian and Coptic versions omit the words 'the 
		God.' On the other hand, the Greek text and the Latin version contain them, and 
		the passage is quoted by two Fathers of the sixth century with the words 
		inserted. On Ignatius' use of the word 'God' as applied to Jesus Christ see
        Introd. § 4.<br>
 [2] Cf. Gal. ii. 20. But here the idea is faith in the reality of 
		the sufferings and death of Christ upon the Cross. Cf. Polyc. <i>Phil</i>, 7.<br>
 [3] Cf. 
		Eph. 18, note.<br>
 [4] Cf. Matt. iii. 15.<br>
 [5] Cf. Luke xxiii. 7-12 ; Acts iv. 27 ; and 
		see Introd. p. 17.<br>
 [6] Cf. Trall. 11. The Cross here, as in that passage, is 
		represented apparently as a tree.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words &#945;&#966; &#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#957; are 
		rendered by Wake, following the Latin translator, 'by the fruits of which we 
		are, even by His most blessed Passion,' the 'which' referring to the tree of 
		the Cross. Zahn takes a similar construction, but refers the relative pronoun 
		to Christ. In this case the fruit would be the Christian converts, in whom 
		Christ 'sees of the travail of His soul,' and the meaning would be further 
		explained by the following words, 'even of His most blessed Passion.' In 
		illustration Zahn quotes John iv. 36, Rom. i. 13, 1 Cor. ix. 19 sq. This seems 
		preferable to Lightfoot's rendering, 'from which fruit are we,' which 
		requires us to represent Christ Himself as 'the fruit hanging upon the tree.' 
		Possibly, however, the text is corrupt and we should read &#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#953;, 'of Whom we 
		are the fruits.'&nbsp; This would find a parallel in a passage from&nbsp;

 He might raise up an ensign [1] to the ages through His

		one body of His Church.[2]<P>
 II. For all these sufferings He endured for our sakes 
		[that we might be saved]. And He truly suffered, as also He truly raised 
		Himself up.[3] Nor is it the case, as some unbelievers affirm, that He suffered 
		in semblance —it is they who are semblance.[4] And according to their opinions, 
		so shall it happen unto them, for they are unsubstantial and
 spirit-like.[5]<P>

		And when He came to<hr>

          <P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
 Clement of Alexandria quoted by Zahn, where the church is 
		called 'His fruits' (&#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#953;).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole clause 'of whose fruit .. . Passion' 
		is a parenthesis. The following words 'that He might raise' belong to the 
		preceding sentence.<br>
 [1] A reference to Isaiah v. 26; cf. also xlix. 22, lxii. 10. 
		In all these passages the reference is to the rallying of the nations round the 
		standard of Jehovah, set up among the chosen people. Ignatius sees a fulfilment 
		of the prophecy in the Passion crowned by the Resurrection.&nbsp; Jerome states that 
		some Christian writers understood the passage Is. v. 26 to refer to the Cross. 
		The symbolism is certainly found earlier than the time when Constantine adopted 
		the Cross as his standard, and may have been suggested by the language of John 
		xii. 32.<br>
 [2] The language of this passage clearly recalls the teaching of St. 
		Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. Cf. Eph. ii. 16, iii. 6, i. 23 etc.; Col. i. 
		18.<br>
 [3] In c. 6 Ignatius speaks of Christ as being raised by the Father, and this 
		is the more general language of the N. T. But with the present passage cf. John 
		x. 18.<br>
 [4] Cf. Trall. 9, 10, where there is a similar play on the word
        &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;, 
		'seeming,' from which these teachers derived their name Docetae.<br>
 [5] The denial 
		of the reality of the human nature of the Lord involved the denial of the 
		resurrection of the body.&nbsp; There is probably an allusion to this in these last 
		phrases. Ignatius has also in view, probably, the quotation which follows in 
		the next chapter, 'I am not a spirit without body.'<br>
 [6] The Latin version here 
		reads 'I have seen' in place of 'I know.' This was probably due to a careless 
		translation found in Jerome (<i>Vir. Illustr.</i> 16), who is plainly quoting at 
		second-hand from Eusebius.
        </blockquote>
        <P align="center"> 93<P>Peter and those who 
		were with him, He said to them, ' Take, handle me and see that I am not a 
		spirit without body.'[1]&nbsp; And straightway they touched Him and believed, being 
		united with His flesh and spirit.[2] Therefore also they despised death, and were 
		found to rise above death. Moreover after His resurrection He ate with them and 
		drank with them,[3] as living in the flesh, although spiritually united with the 
		Father.<P>IV. Now these things I urge upon you, beloved, knowing that you also 
		are thus minded. But I watch over you to guard you from wild beasts in the form 
		of men, whom you must not only refuse to receive, but, if possible, not even 
		meet [them]. Only pray for them, if haply they may repent. Though
        this[4] is 
		difficult, yet Jesus Christ, our true Life, has power to effect it. For if 
		these deeds were wrought by our Lord in mere semblance, then too are my bonds 
		mere semblance. Why moreover have I surrendered myself
        <blockquote>
          <P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] The incident recorded 
		here bears a strong resemblance to that in Luke xxiv. 36-42. But there are 
		striking differences, which show that it conies from a different source. 
		Especially interesting is the phrase 'an incorporeal spirit,' whereas St. Luke 
		has 'a spirit hath not flesh and bones.' Whether Ignatius derived the quotation 
		from some apocryphal Gospel or from tradition, it is difficult to say. Eusebius 
		quotes this passage of Ignatius (<i>H. E</i>. iii. 36), but admits his ignorance of 
		the source of it. The words are ascribed by Origen to the apocryphal 'Doctrine 
		of Peter,' and by Jerome to the Gospel according to the Hebrews.&nbsp; In any case 
		the words would appear to represent a later tradition than the simpler and more 
		natural words of St. Luke.<br>
          [2] Reading 'spirit' with the Greek text and the 
		Latin and Coptic versions. The Armenian version, however, reads 'blood,' which 
		Lightfoot prefers. Against the argument (see Lightfoot) that 'spirit' might 
		easily be substituted for 'blood,' may be set the counter-argument that the 
		difficulty of understanding how the disciples could be 'joined to His Spirit' 
		may have led to the alteration 'blood.' The invitation to feel the nail-prints 
		might suggest the word 'blood.' On the other hand it is possible that Ignatius 
		had in mind John xx. 20-22 and the incident of the gift of the Spirit of the 
		risen Christ.<br>
          [3] Luke xxiv. 30, 35, 42 ; John xxi. 13.&nbsp;<br>

		beasts? Yet he that is near to the sword is near to God,[1] in the presence of 
		wild beasts, in the presence of God—only may it be in the name of Jesus Christ, 
		that we may suffer with Him. All things I endure,[2] since He, the perfect Man, 
		makes me strong.[3]<P> V. Yet Him certain persons ignorantly deny, or rather they 
		have been denied by Him,[4] for they are advocates of death[5] rather than of the 
		truth. They have not hearkened unto the prophecies nor the law of
        Moses,[6] nor 
		even up till now to the Gospel, nor to the sufferings which we severally
        endure.[7] For they have the same thoughts also about us.[8] For what profit is it 
		to me, if a man praises me, but speaks evil of my Lord, refusing to confess 
		that He has borne our flesh? But he that will not assert this has completely 
		denied Him, and himself bears about with him a corpse.[9]&nbsp; Now their names, since 
		they are unbelievers, I have not thought good to write. May I not even remember 
		them, until they have repented and turned to the Passion, which is our 
		resurrection.

          <P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Cf. a saying attributed to our Lord, recorded by
          Didymus on Ps. lxxxviii. 8:&nbsp; 'He who is near Me is near the fire, he that is afar from Me is 
		far from the Kingdom.'<br>
          [2] Cf. 2 Tim. ii. 10.<br>
          [3] Cf. Phil. iv. 13.<br>
          [4] Cf. 2 Tim. 
		ii. 12 ; Gal. iv. 9.<br>
          [5] That is, by denying Christ's death and resurrection they 
		deny the Christian hope of immortality.<br>
          [6] This need not refer to Judaistic 
		teaching, but may equally well be said of any error which ignored the 
		testimony of the prophets and the facts of the Lord's life. For the Christian 
		attitude to Old Testament prophecy see Magn. 9, Philad. 5, 8, 9.<br>
          [7] Their 
		sufferings are a testimony to Christ's death and resurrection.<br>
          [8] Cf. c. 4. 
		Their view of Christ's death and resurrection leads them to think of Christ's 
		martyrs as idle visionaries.<br>
          [9]See note above on c. 2. According to their 
		teaching the body which they bore about with them was already practically a 
		corpse, since they had undermined the belief in the resurrection.&nbsp;

		passage in writers of the fifth and sixth centuries, but they are omitted by 
		the Greek text and the Latin, Armenian, and Coptic versions. Against their 
		genuineness is the fact that Ignatius never speaks of Christ as 'God' in this 
		absolute way. See Introd. § 4.<br>
          [3] Matt. xix. 12.<br>

          [5] For the 'order' of widows see 1 Tim. v. 
		9 and cf. Acts vi. 1, ix. 41; see also Polyc. 4. From early times the Church 
		organized with the greatest care her benevolent work. About 250 A.D. Cornelius 
		claimed that in the Church of Rome there were 'fifteen hundred widows and 
		persons in distress, all of whom the grace and kindness of the Master nourish'
        (Euseb. <i>H.E</i>. vi. 43)<br>
          [6] Cf. Heb x. 34. The Greek text and the Latin version 
		add after 'prisoner' the words 'or him that has been released.'&nbsp; But they are 
		probably spurious.<br>
          [7] On the word 'Eucharist' see Philad. 4 note. By 'abstaining from Eucharist' Ignatius means that they abstained from the 
		authorized, public Eucharist of the Church. None of the Gnostic sects appear to 
		have altogether ceased from holding Eucharistic feasts in their own assemblies. 
		But according to Ignatius such Eucharists would not be regular or 'valid.' See 
		c. 8.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prayer refers to the public prayer of the Church, especially that

		language of John vi.&nbsp; Similarly Irenaeus argues that the Gnostics are 
		inconsistent in offering the Eucharistic gifts, holding such views as they do 
		upon the human nature of Christ (Iren. iv. 18. 5)<br>
        [1] That is, the Incarnation 
		and its issues, including a reference to the Eucharist.<br>
        [2] Cf. above, c. 5, and
        Philad. 5, 9.<br>
        [3] Ignatius here warns them against separatism, as above he has been warning them against heresy.&nbsp;
        The Docetae were guilty of both.<br>
        [4] Cf. <i>antea</i>, Magn. 6, 7, 13; Trall. 2, 3.<br>

        [6] The word translated 'valid' (&#946;&#949;&#958;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;) is found in Rom. 
		iv. 16, Heb. ii. 2, ix. 17, and also in Ign. <i>Rom</i>. 3. It expresses the idea of 
		security, and is used of the ratification of a promise or the validity of a 
		covenant. It is the opposite of that which is precarious and insecure. Ignatius 
		emphasizes the sacramental, no less than the doctrinal, unity of the Church. 
		Cf. his language on the 'one altar' in Magn. 7, Philad. 4, and see
        Introd. § 4.&nbsp;

		97<P> Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.[1] It is 
		not lawful apart from the bishop either to baptize [2] or to hold a
        love-feast.[3] 
		But whatsoever he approves, that also is&nbsp;
        <blockquote>
          <P style="background-color: #C0C0C0"> [1] 'The bishop, argues Ignatius, is 
		the centre of each individual Church, as Jesus Christ is the centre of the 
		universal Church.' — L<span style="font-variant: small-caps">IGHTFOOT</span>. This is the earliest occurrence in Christian 
		literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church' (&#951; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#951;
        &#949;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945;). The 
		original sense of the word is 'universal.'&nbsp; Thus Justin Martyr (<i>Dial</i>. 82) speaks 
		of the 'universal or general resurrection,' using the words &#951; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#951;
        &#945;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;. 
		Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the 
		particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church 'the 
		aggregate of all the Christian congregations ' (Swete, <i> Apostles' Creed,</i> p.
          76).&nbsp; So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed 'to all the 
		congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place.' And this primitive 
		sense of 'universal' the word has never lost, although in the latter part of 
		the second century it began to receive the secondary sense of 'orthodox' as 
		opposed to 'heretical.'&nbsp; Thus it is used in an early Canon of Scripture, the 
		Muratorian fragment (circa 190-210 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical 
		writings as 'not received in the Catholic Church.'&nbsp; So too Cyril of Jerusalem, 
		in the fourth century, says that the Church is called Catholic not only 'because it is spread throughout the world,' but also 'because it teaches 
		completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the 
		knowledge of men.'&nbsp; This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning 
		because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole 
		Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was 
		essentially partial and local.&nbsp; The use of the word in this passage by Ignatius 
		has been urged as an indication of the late date of the epistles. But the fact 
		that it is used in its primary sense is on the contrary an indication of early 
		date.<br>
        [2] Ignatius is writing at a time when the extent of a bishop's 
		administration did not exceed that of a town parish at the present day, and 
		when the clergy worked in much closer connection with him than is possible now. 
		(See note, Rom. 2.) The principle underlying his statement, however, is the 
		general necessity of due authorization of ministerial acts by the bishop.<br>
        [3]
        &#945;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#957;. The earliest use of the word in this sense is Jude 12 (cf. 2 Pet. ii. 
		13, where &#945;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#962; is read by some MSS. in place of &#945;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#962;, 
       'deceivings'). The name was given to the social meals, in which the early Church 
		sought to give expression to the unity and brotherly love of its members. There 
		are analogies to the custom in Jewish life and in the club feasts of Greek and 
		Roman life. The fact that our Lord instituted the Eucharist in connection with 
		a common meal may explain the association of the two at Corinth in the time of 
		St. Paul (l Cor. xi. 17 f.), though the name Agap<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightfoot thinks that in

		appears to describe the two most important functions in which a bishop could 
		bear a part, and it is difficult to explain the omission of the Eucharist, if 
		it is not included in the phrase. Hence he argues that in the time of Ignatius 
		the separation of the two had not yet taken place (see Introd. p. 18). But this 
		argument is weakened by the fact that the connection of the bishop with the 
		Eucharist has already been sufficiently indicated in what precedes. In the 
		almost contemporary letter of Pliny to Trajan (c. 112 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D</span>.), after describing 
		how the Christians met before daylight and sang a hymn to Christ as God and 
		bound themselves by an oath (<i>sacramento</i>) to live a strict life, the writer goes 
		on: 'After this was done, their custom was to depart and meet again to take 
		food, which was, however, quite ordinary and harmless.'&nbsp; In this description 
		Lightfoot sees a reference to the celebration of the Eucharist (<i>sacramentum</i> may 
		mean 'oath' or 'sacrament') before daylight followed by a later meeting for 
		the Agap<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

		problem of its connection with the Eucharist is the more difficult owing to the 
		sacred character given to other meals than the Eucharist in early Christian 
		times, and the fact that religious exercises were associated with them. See<i>
          e.g</i>. the description of an evening meal (which appears to have been an
