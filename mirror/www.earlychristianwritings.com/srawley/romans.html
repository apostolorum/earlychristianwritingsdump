 IV. THE EPISTLE TO THE 
		ROMANS.&nbsp;
        <blockquote>
		<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
 [This epistle was one of the four letters written from Smyrna. It bears 
		the date August 24th. While the other letters were called forth by the dangers 
		and heresies which threatened the life of the Churches addressed, this deals 
		with a personal matter, his own impending martyrdom. Of heresy we hear nothing. 
		His favourite topic, Church order, is not once mentioned. Certain members of 
		the Syrian Church had preceded Ignatius to Rome with news of his coming 
		martyrdom. He fears that the influential Church in that city may intercede for 
		him, and, by procuring some commutation of his sentence, rob him of the crown 
		of martyrdom. He earnestly deprecates their interference, and expresses his own 
		passionate desire for a martyr's death. On account of this strong personal 
		interest the letter was more popular, and is quoted earlier, than any of the 
		others. It became, in Lightfoot's words, a ' sort of martyr's manual,' and 
		influenced largely the language and ideas of several of the early stories of 
		martyrdom. The epistle was incorporated in the Antiochene Acts of the martyrdom 
		and so became dissociated from the other letters in its transmission, being 
		preserved in a separate set of manuscripts and translated separately. The only 
		extant Greek manuscript which contains the epistle is the Colbertine MS. of the 
		tenth century in the National Library at Paris, the epistle being incorporated 
		in the Acts of the martyrdom.]

        [2] These words describe merely the area over which the 
		Roman Church exercised supervision. Cf. Tertullian, <i> de Praescr</i>. 36: 'Go 
		through the Apostolic churches, in which the very seats of the Apostles, at 
		this very day, preside over their own places.' Others, however, have urged that

		salute in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the Father; to them that are united 
		in flesh and spirit with every one of His commandments, being wholly filled 
		with the grace of God, without wavering, and strained clear from every foreign
        dye,[2] warmest greeting in Jesus Christ our God without blame.&nbsp;
		<P>
 I. My prayer to 
		God has been heard, and I have been permitted to see your holy faces, so that I 
		have gained even more than I was asking.[3] For in bonds in Christ Jesus I hope 
		to salute you, if it be God's will that I should be accounted worthy to reach 
		the end.[4] For the beginning is well ordained if I may attain the

        <blockquote>
		<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
        supremacy of 
		the Roman Church among the churches of the world, as though he said, 'To her 
		that, being situate in the district of the region of the Romans, has the chief 
		place [among churches].' But, as Lightfoot urges, in that case it is difficult 
		to see why Ignatius did not write merely 'in Rome,' when describing the 
		locality of the church. The text of the passage, however, is not above 
		suspicion, and it has recently been suggested (Phillimore, <i>Journ. of
        Theol. Studies</i>, xix. (1918), p. 276) that &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965; should be read for
        &#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;. The
        passage then runs 'to her that presides over the Romans in the place of Christ.' 
		Cf. Magn. 6, where the Greek text and Latin version read &#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#957; for
        &#964;&#965;&#960;&#959;&#957;, 'the bishop presiding in the place of God.' Cf. also Eph. 3, Smyrn. 8.&nbsp;
		<br>
        [1] As the 
		Church of Rome had the supremacy of rank among the churches in the region 
		around it, so too was it foremost among them in works of love. Dionysius of 
		Corinth (<i>c</i>. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D</span>. 175) testifies to the world-wide charity of the Roman Church
        (Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> iv. 23).&nbsp;
		<br>
        [2] The 'foreign dye' is the colouring-matter which 
		pollutes the purity of a stream. The Church had been kept pure from grave 
		errors of doctrine and life. For the metaphor cf. Philad. 3.&nbsp;
		<br>
        [3] He had asked 
		that he might visit Rome. His prayer had been granted, with the further favour 
		that he was privileged to visit it as a prisoner of Jesus Christ, soon to be 
		glorified by a martyr's death.&nbsp;
		<br>
        [4] That is, the goal of his ambition, martyrdom.</p>

 end and so receive my inheritance without 
		hindrance. For I fear lest your very love should do me wrong. For you may 
		easily do what you will.[1] But for me it is difficult to attain unto God, unless 
		you spare me.&nbsp;
		<P>
 II. For I would not that you should please men, but that you 
		should please God,[2] as indeed you do.&nbsp; For I shall never have such an 
		opportunity of attaining unto God, nor can you, if you keep silent, be
 credited[3] with a nobler deed.&nbsp; For if you keep silent and spare me, I am a word 
		of God, but if you crave for my flesh, I shall again be a mere voice.[4] [Nay] 
		give me nothing&nbsp;
        <blockquote>
		<P style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] Christianity had already found its way into the higher ranks 
		of Roman society. In the reign of Domitian (95 A.D.) the consul, Flavius 
		Clemens, a cousin of the Emperor, had been executed, and his wife banished on a 
		charge which has been proved to have arisen from their profession of 
		Christianity. Ignatius is afraid that influence in high quarters will result in 
		his respite. Lucian the heathen satirist, who wrote about 165 A.D., describes 
		the efforts made by the Christians to procure the release of their imprisoned 
		brethren (<i>De morte Peregrini</i>, c. 12).
		<br>[2] Cf. 1 Thess. ii. 4.&nbsp;
		<br>[3] 'Be credited,' 
		literally, 'have your name attached to.' An allusion probably, as Zahn 
		suggests, to the practice of craftsmen, who inscribe their names on the work 
		they have completed. The idea of Ignatius is that his martyrdom will be a great 
		achievement, in which they will have their part by restraining their desire to 
		intercede for him.
		<br>[4] There is a distinction here between &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;, 'a word,' 
		expressing the intelligible utterance of a rational being, and &#966;&#959;&#957;&#951;, which 
		henotes a mere irrational cry. Both words occur in the opening chapter of St. 
		John's Gospel, &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;, 'the Word,' being used of the Eternal Son of God, as 
		Revealer of the Father, while St. John the Baptist describes himself as
        &#966;&#959;&#957;&#951;, 
		'a mere voice of one crying," i. e. a mere impersonal instrument. See John i. 
		I, 14, 23. Thus the thought of Ignatius is, 'My death will render my life 
		intelligible as a living message to man from God, whereas, if I am spared, my 
		life will be as destitute of meaning as the cry of an irrational animal.' The 
		text of the passage, however, shows considerable variation, probably due to 
		alteration through failure to see the above distinction. The Greek text and the 
		Armenian version read instead of &#966;&#959;&#957;&#951; the word &#964;&#961;&#949;&#967;&#959;&#957;, which Lightfoot 
		understands to mean that Ignatius 'would be put back again to run the race.' 
		Similarly the word &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962; has been changed to &#947;&#949;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; ('I shall

          God,' instead of, 'I shall 
		be a word of God' probably because of the seeming irreverence in attributing 
		the title, 'word of God,' to any one but our Lord.
        
        <br>[1] The 'libation,' the 
		'altar,' and the 'choir,' are suggested by the ritual of a heathen sacrifice. 
		For a similar metaphor cf. Eph. 9.&nbsp;
        <br>[2] The genitive &#931;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#962; is probably here 
		equivalent to little more than an adjective, 'the Syrian bishop,' or ' the 
		bishop from Syria.'&nbsp; It must not be understood to imply jurisdiction over the 
		whole of Syria, as though it were the equivalent of &#964;&#951;&#962; &#949;&#957;
          &#931;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#949;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#962;, 
		'bishop of the church which is in Syria.' The organization of large dioceses 
		was of later growth, and followed the lines of Roman imperial administration. 
		The bishop of the second and third centuries resembled, so far as the extent of 
		his administration went, the rector of a town parish in modern times. See
        Introd. p. 34 note. 
        <br>[3] Ignatius plays on the words &#948;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#962;, 'West,' lit. 
		'setting of the sun," and &#945;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#951;, 'East,' lit. 'rising of the sun.'
       <br>[4] &#949;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#949;, lit. 'envied.' The word is found in Gal. iii. I, and means 
		literally 'to bewitch,' with special reference to the power of the evil eye. 
		The derived notion of 'envy' follows from this use. Ignatius means 'You have 
		never grudged any one the honour of martyrdom.' 
		<br>[5] Probably a reference to the 
		encouragement and exhortations given to previous martyrs by the Roman 
		Christians. The particular form, however, of the following sentence rather 
		favours the view that Ignatius is referring to some definite, written charge 
		upon the subject, such as is found in the letter of Clement of Rome to the 
		Corinthians, which contains exhortations to follow the example of the martyrs. 
		<br>[6] Ignatius expresses the hope that they will not depart, in his own case, from 
		the principles of the teaching which they have given, to others on the subject 
		of martyrdom.
        </blockquote>

		be called but be found a Christian. 
		For if I be found a Christian, then can I also receive the name; then too can I 
		be faithful when I am not visible to the world. Nothing that is visible is
        good.[1] For our God, Jesus Christ, is the more clearly visible now that He is in 
		the Father.[2] The Work is not of persuasive eloquence,[3] but Christianity is a 
		thing of might whenever it is hated by the world.&nbsp;
        <p> IV. I write unto all the 
		churches, and charge them all to know that I die willingly for God, if you 
		hinder not. I intreat you, do not unseasonably befriend me. Suffer me to belong 
		to the wild beasts, through whom I may attain unto God. I am God's grain, and I 
		am ground by the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be found pure bread.4 Rather 
		entice the wild beasts to become my tomb, and to leave naught of my body, that 
		I may not, when I have fallen asleep, prove a burden to any
        man.[5]</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">[1] 'Visible,' <i>e.g</i>. material and transient. Cf. 2 Cor. iv. 18. Ignatius is speaking of the 
		material world as it exists apart from God. On his general view of the 
		relations of 'spirit' and 'matter,' see Introd. § 4.
        <br>[2] A paradox. Christ's 
		true power, manifested in the life of the Church, is more clearly seen now that 
		He has passed out of the sight of human eyes, than it was when in His earthly 
		life He was subject to the malice and misunderstanding of men.
        <br>[3] Cf. Eph. 14. 'The Work' is the Gospel. Christianity is not a matter of words but of deeds. 
		Cf. the old motto 'taire et faire.'
        <br>[4] Some MSS. add, after 'bread,' the words 
		'of Christ,' while others have 'of God,' and others omit both. The figure in 
		this passage is suggested by the sacrificial loaves which were offered both 
		among Jews and Gentiles. Lightfoot would see a more definite reference to the 
		Pentecostal loaves (Lev. xxiii. 17). The 'pure' bread is that which was made 
		of the finest flour. Ignatius is the grain which is ground by the teeth of the 
		beasts and fitted for an offering to God.
        <br>[6] He is thinking of the difficulties 
		likely to attend his burial. The spurious Acts of the martyrdom vary in their 
		account of the treatment of his reliques. The Antiochene Acts narrate (c. 6) 
		that only the tougher parts of his reliques were left, and that these were 
		carried back to Antioch and laid in a sarcophagus. The Roman&nbsp;</p>

        freedman,[3] and in

        Acts state that the beasts only crushed him to death, 
		without touching his flesh, 'that his reliques might be a protection to the 
		great city of the Romans' (c. 10). On the later history of his reliques see
        Introd. § 3.        
        <br>[1] That is, the wild beasts.
        <br>[2] Both these Apostles had been 
		connected with the Roman Church. Their names also appear in conjunction in the 
		letter written by Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, c. 5. St. Peter's 
		residence at Rome, with his martyrdom there, rests on too strong evidence to be 
		rejected. It is explicitly mentioned by a succession of Christian writers in 
		the latter half of the second century, i.e. by Dionysius of Corinth,
        Irenaeus, 
		Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria. The 'Church in Babylon' in 1 Pet. v. 13 is 
		now generally understood to refer to Rome. Finally, the Roman presbyter Gaius 
		tells us that in his day (<i>circa</i> 200 A.D.) the tombs of the two Apostles were to 
		be seen on the Vatican and Ostian Ways. On the other hand the evidence for 
		their martyrdom at the same time is slender, being derived from the statement 
		of Dionysius of Corinth, who wrote in the second half of the second century (c. 
		175 A.D.), and was not intimately connected with the Roman Church. Accordingly 
		some recent scholars have rejected his statement and incline to the view that 
		St. Peter was the survivor of St. Paul. This would help to account for the 
		greater prominence of his name in later days in the memory of the Roman Church. 
		See Ramsay, (<i>Ch. in R. E</i>., p. 279 ff.; Sanday, <i>Expositor</i>, IV. vii. p. 411 f.;

        treated.[3] 
		Yet through their unjust doings I am more truly learning discipleship. <i> Yet am I 
		not hereby justified</i>[4] May I have joy of the beasts that are prepared for me. I 
		pray too that they may prove expeditious with me. I will even entice them to 
		devour me expeditiously, and not to refrain, as they have refrained from
        some,[5] 
		through fear. And even though they are not willing without
        constraint,[6] I will 
		compel them. Pardon me. I know what is expedient for me. Now I am beginning to 
		be a disciple. May naught of things visible or invisible seek to
        allure[7] me; 
		that I may attain unto Jesus Christ.

        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0"> [1] It has been urged that the use of this 
		word is an anachronism and a proof that this letter is not genuine, the word 
		not being found in any writer of the second century. Lightfoot, however, refers 
		to its use in a rescript of the Emperors Marcus and Commodus (A.D. 177—180), 
		and a still earlier use by Galen about half a century after the time of 
		Ignatius. The word is probably of Roman origin, and Lightfoot shows that it was 
		already in process of formation in the time of Pliny some thirty or forty years 
		before this time. Syrian leopards are mentioned by Vopiscus as having been 
		exhibited by the Emperor Probus. See Lightfoot <i> in loco</i>.

        <br> [2] His escort consisted 
		of ten soldiers, who relieved one another in turn. Like St. Paul (Acts
        xxviii. 
		16, 20), Ignatius was attached by a 'coupling-chain' to a guard by night and 
		day.

        <br> [3] This probably refers to the sums of money given to the soldiers by 
		friends of Ignatius to procure for him better treatment. This common Christian 
		practice is alluded to in Lucian's famous satire on the Christians, <i>De
        Morte Peregrini</i>, c. 12.

        <br> [4] 1 Cor. iv. 4.

        <br> [5] Cf. Euseb. <i>H. E</i>. viii. 7, where similar 
		instances are cited in the case of the Egyptian martyrs. Similar incidents are 
		recorded of the martyrs of Vienne in 177 A.D. (Euseb. <i> H. E</i>. v. i). In the 
		present passage Ramsay, following Zahn, thinks that there is a reference to the 
		story of Thecla as contained in a first-century document on which be supposes 
		the Acts of Paul and Thecla to be based (<i>Ch. in R. Emp</i>. pp. 381, 404).

        <br> [6] 
		Lightfoot, however, translates 'to devour me, though I am ready.'

        <br> [7] &#950;&#951;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#962;. Cf. Gal. iv. 17 ; 2 Cor. xi. 2. In both those passages, and 
		probably in the present passage, there is the idea of assiduous attention. 
		Lightfoot, however, understands the word to mean 'envy.'</p>

		earthly desire,[2] but only water that lives[3] and speaks in me,[4] and says from 
		within me, ' Come hither to the Father.' I have no pleasure in the food of

        bread,[5]

        <blockquote>

        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0"> [1] &#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;. This word has been 
		understood in two widely different senses— <br>(a) Zahn and Lightfoot understand it 
		to mean Move' in the lower sense of 'lust,' 'passion.' According to this view 
		Ignatius declares that he has crucified the carnal passions of his nature. In 
		the only two passages of the LXX where the word occurs, it bears this sense. 
		See Prov. vii. 18, xxx. 16. It does not occur in the N. T., which uses &#945;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951; 
		to denote 'love.' <br>(b) An interpretation which has been current since the 
		time of Origen's Commentary on the Song of Songs, refers &#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; objectively to 
		Christ. 'My Love has been crucified.' And so the words were commonly 
		understood by later writers. This interpretation is rejected by Zahn and 
		Lightfoot, but it has found a fresh defender in Dr. C. Bigg (Bampton Lectures, 
		p. viii f.). He shows fairly conclusively that &#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; and its cognates may be 
		used in a higher sense, and also that &#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; may be used of the object of 
		love. This sense agrees too with the context. Ignatius is 'in love" with death, 
		'because Christ, his Beloved, is crucified, and perfect union with Him will be 
		attained by death.' His love for Christ draws him away from material things. On 
		the whole this interpretation, perhaps, suits best the highly imaginative 
		fervour of the passage. <br>[2] Reading with Zahn and Lightfoot &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#957; — ' 
		loving matter,' 'carnal.' <br>[3] The phrase 'living water' recalls John iv. 10, II. 
		For its use in connection with the Spirit, see John vii. 38-39. 
		<br>[4] The words &#954;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#957;
		 ('water . . . that speaketh') are probably corrupt. If retained they 
		must be held to refer to the prophetic power said to be imparted by certain 
		springs to those who drank them. Lightfoot thinks that the longer Greek 
		recension has here preserved the true text, &#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; for 
		&#954;&#945;&#953; &#955;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#957;. This 
		would present a further parallel to St. John's Gospel (iv. 14), and the passage 
		would run, 'water that lives and springs up.' 
		<br>[5] Cf. John vi. 33, and the section John vi. 48-59. 
		<br>[6] Cf. Eph. 18. Ignatius may have the Docetic teachers 
		in mind. Only if Christ has become truly incarnate, is it possible for our 
		manhood to be united with God. 
		<br>[7] See note on Trall. 8. The parallelism of that 
		passage suggests</p>

        <p> VIII. I desire no longer to live 
		the common life of men. And this will be granted, if it is your desire. Desire 
		it, that you too may be desired. In a short letter I entreat you. Believe me, 
		Jesus Christ shall make this clear to you, that I speak truly—even He Who is 
		the Mouth which cannot speak falsely, whereby the Father spake [truly]. Intreat 
		for me, that I may attain in the Holy Spirit. I write not unto you after the

		I be rejected, it is because of your hatred.</p>

        <p>IX. Remember in your prayer [1] the 
		Church in Syria, since it hath God as its shepherd[2] in my room. Jesus Christ 
		alone shall be its bishop[3]—together with your love. But as for me, I am ashamed 
		to be spoken of as one of them. Nor indeed am I worthy, since I am the last of 
		them and one born out of due time;[4] but I have received mercy that I should be 
		some one, if haply I may attain unto God. My spirit salutes you, as also does 
		the love of the churches which received me in the name of Jesus Christ, not as 
		one that merely passed by, for even the churches which lay not[5] naturally near 
		to my route went before me from city to city.[6]</p>

        <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">that the

		regarded as the means of union with the incarnate Christ, or, better still, as 
		the fruit and issue of that union. Zahn, however, refers the words to the whole 
		preceding sentence. 'The participation in the flesh and blood of Christ is 
		love incorruptible.' He sees in it a reference to the Agape or Love-Feast.
